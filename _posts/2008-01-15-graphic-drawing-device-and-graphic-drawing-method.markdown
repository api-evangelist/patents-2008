The present invention relates to a graphic drawing device for and a graphic drawing method of converting a two dimensional object defined in a vector format to a distance field to carry out antialiasing drawing.

Because a two dimensional object defined in a vector format is provided by an expression such as a Bezier curve or a spline curve the two dimensional object has a feature that it can be graphically drawn without any jaggy occurring even if it is enlarged or reduced like a bitmapped image.

For example a TrueType outline font and an SVG Scalable Vector Graphics using W3C are examples of this vector graphics processing.

Furthermore as a low level API Application Programming Interface of vector graphics OpenVG specifications have been drawn up and a graphics library and hardware which comply with OpenVG have been developed.

In vector graphics in order to display the jaggy of an edge portion smoothly antialiasing drawing is needed.

As antialiasing drawing methods for example a super sampling method refer to patent reference 1 of dividing a pixel into a plurality of subpixels and calculating a luminance value from an occupation ratio of area and a method refer to patent reference 2 of calculating a luminance value from a distance from the center of a pixel are provided.

In accordance with the super sampling method or a multi sample method a pixel is further divided into smaller subpixels and the value of the pixel is determined from the average of the values of these subpixels.

For example one pixel is divided into 4 4 16 subpixels each of the 16 virtual subpixels is subjected to drawing and the average of the values of those subpixels is finally determined as the last value of the pixel.

Accordingly in the case of using this method because the drawing time increases in proportion to the number of subpixels it is difficult to carry out real time drawing at a high speed.

Therefore in order to implement the drawing at a high speed it is necessary to perform the arithmetic processing on the subpixels in parallel and hence the hardware scale increases.

In addition in this method the luminance value cannot be expressed without providing gradations in the above mentioned case it can be expressed only with 16 gradations . Therefore because the luminance value to be drawn is not calculated correctly any edge line cannot be drawn smoothly. As a result the occurrence of jaggy cannot be prevented certainly and the displayed image may degrade.

On the other hand in accordance with the method of calculating the luminance value of a pixel from the distance from the center of the pixel to a straight line the distance to the straight line has to be calculated for each pixel. Furthermore in a case of carrying out antialiasing drawing of a curved line defined in a vector format after the curved line is divided into minute line segments the shortest one of the distances from each pixel to the minute line segments has to be selected.

Therefore it is necessary to calculate the distances in advance from the center of each pixel to be drawn to all the divided minute line segments. In following patent reference 2 only linear antialiasing is described. However it is clear that in a case in which the object is a complicated curved line the amount of arithmetic operation of calculating distances becomes huge.

Because conventional graphic drawing devices are constructed as mentioned above a problem is that in order to implement high speed real time drawing it is necessary to perform an arithmetic process on subpixels in parallel and hence the hardware scale increases. A further problem is that because any edge line cannot be drawn smoothly the occurrence of jaggy cannot be prevented certainly and the displayed image may degrade.

The present invention is made in order to solve the above mentioned problems and it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a graphic drawing device and a graphic drawing method which can implement correct antialiasing drawing with a small amount of arithmetic operation without causing any degradation in the displayed image.

A graphic drawing device in accordance with the present invention includes a distance information generating means for rasterizing minute line segments divided by a curved line dividing means through a combination of straight line cells and corner cells to generate distance information corresponding to a pixel of a display and an edge rasterizing means for rasterizing edge information about the minute line segments divided by the curved line dividing means and a mapping means determines whether the pixel is located inside or outside by using the edge information rasterized by the edge rasterizing means and maps the distance information generated by the distance information generating means onto antialiasing intensity of a component included in the pixel according to a result of the inside or outside determination.

Therefore the present invention offers an advantage of being able to implement correct antialiasing drawing with a small amount of arithmetic operation without causing any degradation in the displayed image.

Hereafter in order to explain this invention in greater detail the preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.

A curved line dividing unit carries out a process of carrying out matrix transformation of curved apex coordinates and control point coordinates represented by the vector data in this specification a curved line is conceptually defined to include a straight line as well as a so called curved line to divide the matrix transformed curved line into minute line segments. The curved line dividing unit constructs a curved line dividing means.

A parameter setting unit carries out a process of setting an external cutoff and an internal cutoff as antialiasing setting parameters for specifying the intensity of antialiasing which is to be performed on the path data which construct the vector data .

A distance information generating unit carries out a process of rasterizing the minute line segments into which the matrix transformed curved line is divided by the curved line dividing unit through a combination of straight line cells and corner cells by using the antialiasing setting parameters set by the parameter setting unit to generate distance information corresponding to each pixel of a display the distance information is a value ranging from 1 to 1 and is expressed as a value of 0 when the pixel is on an edge line and when the distance information is a negative number shows that the pixel is located outside the object .

A distance buffer is a memory for storing the distance information generated by the distance information generating unit .

A distance information generating means is comprised of the parameter setting unit the distance information generating unit and the distance buffer .

An edge rasterizing unit rasterizes edge information of the minute line segments into which the matrix transformed curved line is divided by the curved line dividing unit and stores the rasterized edge information in an edge buffer . The edge buffer is a memory for storing the edge information rasterized by the edge rasterizing unit .

A mapping unit carries out a process of determining whether each pixel is located inside or outside the object by using the edge information stored in the edge buffer and mapping the distance information stored in the distance buffer onto the antialiasing intensity of each component included in each pixel according to the results of the determination of whether each pixel is located inside or outside the object.

Each pixel can include one or more components e.g. in a case in which an output device is of RGB type each pixel typically includes red blue and green components .

The anti aliased intensity of each pixel can be drawn on the display such as a CRT or an LCD as a part of an image.

In the example of it is assumed that each of the curved line dividing unit the parameter setting unit the distance information generating unit the edge rasterizing unit and the mapping unit which are the components of the graphic drawing device is comprised of a piece of hardware exclusively used in the graphic drawing device e.g. a semiconductor circuit board on which an MPU is mounted . As an alternative in a case in which the graphic drawing device consists of a computer a graphic drawing program in which the descriptions of processes carried out by the curved line dividing unit the parameter setting unit the distance information generating unit the edge rasterizing unit and the mapping unit are described can be stored in a memory of the computer and a CPU of the computer can execute the graphic drawing program stored in the memory.

When receiving the vector data the curved line dividing unit carries out matrix transformation of the apex coordinates and the control point coordinates of the curved line expressed by the vector data step ST .

Accordingly the curved line dividing unit can perform a process such as enlargement reduction rotation or parallel translation on the path data which construct the vector data .

For example by using a 4 4 matrix as the matrix the curved line dividing unit can carry out projective transformation thereby being able to provide a three dimensional bird s eye view display effect.

After carrying out matrix transformation of the apex coordinates and the control point coordinates of the curved line expressed by the vector data the curved line dividing unit divides the matrix transformed curved line into minute line segments step ST .

More specifically the curved line dividing unit carries out a process of approximately dividing the matrix transformed curved line into a plurality of minute line segments.

The number of divisions is determined by the curvature and size of the curved line and is minimized in such away that the curved line is approximated adequately visually by the plurality of minute line segments.

For example in the case in which the object is a secondary Bezier curve PCQ as shown in the Bezier curve is defined by the following parametric form using a parameter t 0 t 1 .

In this case P x0 y0 and Q x2 y2 are apex coordinates and C x1 y1 is control point coordinates. 1 0 2 1 12 1 0 2 1 12

By using the distance D from the middle point M xm ym to the middle point H xh yh the number of divisions N is determined as follows.

In this case T is a constant and if T 0 the number of divisions becomes infinity and the process is equivalent to a true curved line process.

The parameter setting unit sets an external cutoff and an internal cutoff as antialiasing setting parameters for specifying the intensity of antialiasing which is to be performed on the path data which construct the vector data .

For example by increasing the cutoff values the parameter setting unit can increase the blurring of the edge portion whereas by decreasing the cutoff values the parameter setting unit can decrease the blurring of the edge portion.

By setting the cutoff values to 0 the parameter setting unit can make the process equivalent to a process having no antialiasing and can make the edge have jaggy.

Furthermore by making the external cutoff value larger than the internal cutoff value the parameter setting unit can produce an effect of thickening the whole of the object. In contrast by making the external cutoff value smaller than the internal cutoff value the parameter setting unit can produce an effect of thinning the whole of the object.

After the curved line dividing unit divides the matrix transformed curved line into the minute line segments the distance information generating unit rasterizes the divided minute line segments through a combination of straight line cells and corner cells by using the antialiasing setting parameters set by the parameter setting unit to generate distance information corresponding to each pixel of the display and stores the distance information in the distance buffer step ST .

In this embodiment the distance information corresponding to each pixel is a value ranging from 1 to 1 and is expressed as a value of when the pixel is on an edge line. Furthermore when the distance information is a negative number it shows that the pixel is located outside the object.

In the example of each straight line cell is comprised of a rectangle ABEF on a side of the external cutoff and a rectangle BCDE on a side of the internal cutoff.

A comparison between the external cutoff value and the internal cutoff value is made and the larger one of them is selected as the widths of the rectangle ABEF and the rectangle BCDE.

Because each minute line segment is also a true edge line a point on each minute line segment is expressed as a distance value of 0 .

In this stage because no inside or outside determination process has not been performed on the object yet the distance value of each vertex on the cutoff side is uniformly set to 1 .

Therefore the distance values of the vertexes of the rectangle ABEF are defined as 1 0 0 1 and the distance values of the vertexes of the rectangle BCDE are defined as 0 1 1 0 .

After the rectangle ABDE and the rectangle BCDE are determined the distance information distance value is generated for each pixel through the rasterizing process.

In the rasterizing process increments of the distance value in both the X direction and the Y direction are calculated beforehand and a linear interpolation process is carried out in a direction of a scan line so that the distance value can be calculated at a high speed.

On the other hand each corner cell consists of a perfect circle having a radius equal to the external cutoff value or the internal cutoff value.

The distance value at the central point of the circle is expressed as 0 and the distance value on the circumference of the circle is expressed as 1 .

Although the distance from each pixel to the central point can be calculated by using the following equation it can be calculated at a higher speed by approximate calculation using a look up table.

A straight line cell and a corner cell are rasterized per pixel into the distance buffer while they overlap each other.

Therefore in order to write the largest distance value in the distance buffer when writing the distance value in the distance buffer the distance information generating unit makes a comparison between the distance value of the source and that of the destination and writes the larger one of the distance values the distance value closer to 0 in the distance buffer.

By thus dividing the path data which construct the vector data into the minute line segments according to the number N of divisions optimum for the shape and performing the rasterizing process on the minute line segments through a combination of straight line cells and corner cells the distance information generating unit can generate correct distance information necessary for the antialiasing process even for a connecting portion between minute line segments at a high speed without forming a crevice at the connecting portion.

After the curved line dividing unit divides the matrix transformed curved line into the minute line segments the edge rasterizing unit rasterizes the edge information about the divided minute line segments and stores the rasterized edge information in the edge buffer step ST .

When rasterizing the edge information the edge rasterizing unit calculates coordinates to be drawn from the starting point coordinates and the endpoint coordinates of the minute line segments by using for example a DDA Digital Differential Analyzer digital differential analyzer .

As shown in when the edge is upward the edge rasterizing unit carries out a process of adding 1 to the edge data stored in the edge buffer the edge information in the course of rasterizing being carried out whereas when the edge is downward the edge rasterizing unit carries out a process of subtracting 1 from the edge data stored in the edge buffer .

For example in a case in which it is defined that up to 128 edges can overlap one another at the same coordinates 8 bits 2 128 sign bit are needed as the bit width in the depth direction of the edge buffer .

After the rasterizing process on one piece of the path data is completed the mapping unit reads the distance information and the edge information in units of a bit from the distance buffer and the edge buffer .

The mapping unit carries out the inside or outside determination process of determining whether the pixel in question is located inside or outside the object by using the edge information step ST . According to the determination result of the inside or outside determination process the mapping unit maps the distance information onto the antialiasing intensity of each component included in the pixel step ST .

The inside or outside determination process of determining whether the pixel is located inside or outside the object is carried out as shown in for example .

A counter used for the inside or outside determination has an initial value of 0 and a value or read from the edge buffer is sequentially added to the counter refer to and .

In a case of using as a winding fill rule a Non Zero rule a non zero rule it is determined that a pixel whose counter value is 0 is located outside the object and it is determined that a pixel whose counter value is other than 0 is located inside the object refer to and .

In contrast in a case of using as a winding fill rule an Even Odd rule an even odd rule it is determined that a pixel whose least significant bit of the counter value is 0 is located outside the object and it is determined that a pixel whose least significant bit of the counter value is 1 is located inside the object refer to and .

Each negative distance value read from the distance buffer is subjected to a process of inverting the sign of the negative distance value when the negative distance value is calculated for a region which is judged to be located inside the object as shown in .

When the external cutoff value differs from the internal cutoff value the mapping unit does not directly map a region having a distance value ranging from 1 to 1 onto the antialiasing intensity but maps a region having an effective distance value corresponding to the cutoff values onto the antialiasing intensity .

Furthermore the mapping unit performs a luminance correction process optimal for the display on a sloped straight line by using for example a gamma correction or the like refer to .

By thus carrying out the inside or outside determination process using the edge information read from the edge buffer and then carrying out the conversion process of converting the distance information read from the distance buffer on the basis of the inside or outside determination result the graphic drawing device can calculate the antialiasing intensity correctly.

The distance buffer and the edge buffer can have capacities enough to store the distance information and the edge information about the full screen of the display respectively or can have capacities enough to store the distance information and the edge information about a part of the full screen respectively.

In a case in which the distance buffer and the edge buffer have capacities enough to store the distance information and the edge information about a part of the full screen respectively the rasterizing process by the distance information generating unit and the edge rasterizing unit and the mapping process by the mapping unit are carried out a number of times according to divided areas.

In this case because the capacities of the distance buffer and the edge buffer can be reduced to small ones there is an advantage of being able to use a high speed accessible memory.

In a case of carrying out the processes using a CPU the distance information and the edge information about the part of the full screen amount have amounts which can be stored in an on chip cache.

Also in a case of carrying out the processes using hardware exclusively used for the purpose the processes can be carried out by using only a small capacity internal memory without using any external memory.

Furthermore in a case in which the vector data does not represent a closed surface enclosed by arbitrary path data but represents a stroke having a line width specified by arbitrary path data the inside or outside determination process including the winding fill rule becomes unnecessary.

As shown in a straight line cell is decomposed into two rectangles each having a line width which is equal to the addition of half the line width of the straight line cell and a cutoff and their distance values are rasterized. Similarly also in a case of a corner cell the distance value of a circle having a radius which is an addition of half the line width of the corner cell and a cutoff value is rasterized.

After that the antialiasing intensity is calculated only by using the rasterized distance values. Therefore for example in a case of drawing a stroke font defined by only a frame antialiasing drawing can be carried out without having to perform any rasterizing process on edges and therefore the edge buffer becomes unnecessary.

As can be seen from the above description in accordance with this Embodiment 1 the distance information generating unit for rasterizing minute line segments into which a curved line is divided by the curved line dividing unit through a combination of straight line cells and corner cells to generate distance information corresponding to each pixel of the display and the edge rasterizing unit for rasterizing the edge information about the minute line segments into which the curved line is divided by the curved line dividing unit are disposed and the mapping unit is constructed in such a way as to determine whether each pixel is located inside or outside the object by using the edge information rasterized by the edge rasterizing unit and map the distance information generated by the distance information generating unit onto the antialiasing intensity of each component included in each pixel according to the results of the inside or outside determination. Therefore the present embodiment offers an advantage of being able to implement correct antialiasing drawing with a small amount of arithmetic operation without causing any degradation in the displayed image.

A texture reading unit carries out a reading process of reading texture data image data about an image to be stuck on a two dimensional object .

A color value calculating unit carries out a process of performing a color gradation arithmetic operation and a texture arithmetic operation on the texture data read by the texture reading unit to calculate a color value of each component included in each pixel .

A color value calculating means is comprised of the texture reading unit and the color value calculating unit .

A mapping unit maps distance information onto antialiasing intensity in the same way that the mapping unit shown in does and carries out alpha blend of the color value calculated by the color value calculating unit by using the antialiasing intensity onto which the distance information is mapped.

In this Embodiment 2 a method of carrying out vector graphics processing with more general versatility which is an extension of that in accordance with above mentioned Embodiment 1 will be shown.

After the graphic drawing device carries out a rasterizing process of rasterizing the distance information and edge information about one piece of path data in the same way that the graphic drawing device in accordance with above mentioned Embodiment 1 does the color value calculating unit performs a color gradation arithmetic operation and a texture arithmetic operation on the texture data read by the texture reading unit to calculate the color value of each component included in each pixel .

In the color value calculating unit in calculates an address required to read a texture color which is sampling data from the texture data from the X and Y coordinates of the path data. Information about a texture matrix is also used for the calculation of the X and Y coordinates.

The color value calculating unit in carries out the color gradation arithmetic operation. As the gradation for example there are the following types of gradation.

The linear type gradation is a process of when the color values of two points are specified calculating a color at an arbitrary point by using the distances from the two points to the arbitrary point by linear interpolation.

The radial type gradation is a process of when the color value of a central point C cx cy the color value of an attention point F fx fy and a radius r are specified calculating a color value at an arbitrary point P x y by using the gradient d d of the line segment FQ as shown in .

The color value calculating unit in carries out a filtering process of filtering a plurality of texture colors read from the texture data . In the filtering process bilinear mipmap or bicubic is used.

The color value calculating unit in carries out a blending process of blending the gradation color calculated in and the texture color filtered in .

In a case in which the color value calculating unit is implemented via hardware a latency occurring until the texture color is read from the texture data is generally large.

For this reason by calculating the texture address at the time of the rasterizing process performed by the distance information generating unit and performing prefetching on a texture memory the color value calculating unit can conceal the access latency.

After mapping the distance information onto antialiasing intensity in the same way that the mapping unit shown in does the mapping unit carries out alpha blend of the color value calculated by the color value calculating unit by using the antialiasing intensity onto which the distance information is mapped and determines the results of the alpha blend as a last color .

Thus when carrying out antialiasing drawing of the vector data the graphic drawing device can produce a display of a gradation color and attachment of a texture image on an arbitrary graphics. As a result there is provided an advantage of being able to implement a high quality realistic expression.

An information converting unit carries out a process of converting distance information generated by a distance information generating unit into density information and storing the density information in a density buffer .

The density buffer is a memory for storing the density information into which the distance information is converted by the information converting unit .

An information converting means is comprised of the information converting unit and the density buffer .

A mapping unit determines whether each pixel is located inside or outside the object by using edge information stored in an edge buffer maps the density information stored in the density buffer onto the antialiasing intensity of each component included in each pixel according to the results of the inside or outside determination and further carries out alpha blend of a color value calculated by a color value calculating unit by using the antialiasing intensity onto which the density information is mapped.

In above mentioned Embodiments 1 and 2 each of the mapping units and maps the distance information stored in a distance buffer onto the antialiasing intensity of each component included in each pixel as mentioned above. The mapping unit can alternatively convert the distance information into density information and can map the density information instead of the distance information onto the antialiasing intensity of each component included in each pixel .

In any scaling in order to carry out correct antialiasing drawing it is necessary to ensure distance information having a sufficient degree of accuracy.

Therefore even in a case of using either a fixed point format or a floating point format as the format of the distance buffer a data bit length of around 32 bits is needed.

In contrast when using the density information which complies with a display instead of the distance information the degree of accuracy of the density information can be maintained at a sufficient level even though the density information has shorter data bit length.

For example in a case in which the display provides 256 level gray scale correct antialiasing drawing can be implemented by making the density information have a data bit length of 8 bits.

In accordance with this Embodiment 3 the information converting unit converts the distance information generated by the distance information generating unit into density information and stores the density information in the density buffer .

In the process of writing the density information into the density buffer the information converting unit makes a comparison between the density information of the source and that of the destination and writes the larger one of the pieces of density information in the density buffer like in the process of writing the distance information into the distance buffer .

After determining whether each pixel is located inside or outside the object in the same way that the mapping units and shown in do the mapping unit maps the density information stored in the density buffer onto the antialiasing intensity of each component included in each pixel according to the results of the inside or outside determination. The mapping unit further carries out alpha blend of the color value calculated by the color value calculating unit by using the antialiasing intensity onto which the density information is mapped in the same way that the mapping unit shown in does.

By thus using the density information instead of the distance information the capacity of the density buffer can be reduced greatly compared with that of the distance buffer and therefore it becomes able to reduce the hardware scale and power consumption of the graphic drawing device. As a result there is provided an advantage of being able to lengthen the duration of the battery mounted in the graphic drawing device particularly in a case in which the graphic drawing device is a mobile phone or portable information equipment.

In this Embodiment 4 a graphic drawing device in accordance with above mentioned Embodiment 3 is embodied and is enabled to carry out a high speed process by using a flag buffer.

When receiving vector data a glyph engine carries out matrix transformation of path data which construct the vector data to divide a curved line into minute line segments.

The glyph engine also calculates straight line cells corner cells vertex data about edges and parameters from the divided minute line segments.

As the glyph engine a programmable processor such as a DSP an SIMD processor or a shader processor a vertex shader or a pixel shader used in 3D graphics can be used.

The glyph engine also constructs a hinting means and provides automatic hinting for carrying out high quality font drawing with good visibility by utilizing distance information even when drawing a character having a small size.

In the hinting the glyph engine carries out a process of arranging an object in a grid of pixels from the straight line cells and the corner cells first refer to .

The glyph engine then detects pixels on the left and lower edges of the object by using the direction of distance and gradient refer to .

Next the glyph engine deepens the detected pixels refer to thereby lightening the pixels on the opposite edges refer to to increase the contrast of the pixels on the left and lower edges without changing the stroke center of gravity based on appearance.

The glyph engine further improves the contrast against a slanting character body or a thin serif by using the distance and gradient. More specifically by detecting a rapid change in the direction of the gradient the glyph engine deepens the pixels on each of these light colored areas refer to .

These examples are only ones in which a visual hint is automatically provided by using the distance information. The distance information can also be used in order to provide an optimal character gap and a uniform stroke center of gravity.

A straight line cell rasterizer and a corner cell rasterizer carry out rasterization into a density buffer by way of a buffer RAM control unit .

The order of movement of pixels in the rasterization is determined as follows. For example in a case of a straight line cell as shown in movements are performed in both rightward and leftward directions from a true edge line and in a case of a circular cell as shown in movements are performed in both rightward and leftward directions from a diameter extending in the Y direction.

The buffer RAM control unit carries out double buffer control of the density buffer the edge buffer and the flag buffer .

By using the double buffer method the buffer RAM control unit becomes able to process drawing from each rasterizer and reading using a traverse blender in parallel.

The flag buffer stores information showing occurrence of writing of density information into the density buffer with a low resolution. For example the flag buffer holds 1 bit information for each area of 4 4 pixels and when writing occurs for a pixel in an area sets the bit corresponding to this area to 1 .

When reading density information from the density buffer the traverse blender reads only necessary density information about pixels in a drawn area.

As a result the traverse blender can determine the area of path data drawn into the density buffer and can calculate the antialiasing intensity efficiently.

A texture engine calculates a texture address reads sampling data from the texture cache and performs a filtering process on the sampling data.

Finally the traverse blender carries out a process of reading data from the density buffer the edge buffer and the flag buffer calculating a last color value on the basis of the results of an inside or outside determining process and writing the last color value in a frame buffer .

Thus the graphic drawing device becomes able to carry out the automatic hinting by using the glyph engine thereby eliminating the necessity to provide any hint data about fonts required conventionally.

Furthermore by making the density buffer the edge buffer etc. have a double buffer configuration the graphic drawing device becomes able to process the drawing and the reading in parallel and can improve the throughput.

In addition the graphic drawing device becomes able to read only information about a necessary area efficiently by using the flag buffer and process the calculation of the antialiasing intensity at a high speed.

As mentioned above the graphic drawing device in accordance with the present invention is suitable for use in equipment which converts a two dimensional object defined in a vector format to a distance field to carry out correct antialiasing drawing with a small amount of arithmetic operation.
