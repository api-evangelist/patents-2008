The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.

The present invention relates generally to electric energy generation from mechanical sources and more particularly to a transducer module that is optimized to generate electrical energy from environmental mechanical and mechanical compression forces that otherwise could not be used.

While piezoelectric materials have been successfully utilized in sensors and actuators their use as practical power sources for generating a useful amount of electricity in portable generators has been limited. Users of piezoelectric devices are presently substantially limited to operating only very low power devices such as LEDs. This operation is typically limited to only a brief flash.

For practical use the inventor believes that to power portable electrical devices it would be necessary that electricity be generated using a large number of piezoelectric transducers. Preferably such a system would be able to store power generated over a period of time. Thus a practical system would require signal conditioners such as rectifiers and power storage such as batteries. The need for a large number of piezoelectric transducers with many interconnections between components such as rectifiers and batteries increases the weight reduces the robustness and increases the complexity and difficulty of packaging such devices especially for purposes such as being carried on a person device or object. Moreover a practical system should be adaptable for capturing energy produced by different types of motions with different amounts of force or translational movement. The prior art does not address the above problems.

The following U.S. patents describe various prior art systems that may be related to the above and or other transducer module systems.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 955 790 issued Sep. 21 1999 to North discloses a power transfer system for generating electrical energy from recurring wave and tidal movement within the ocean. The system comprises a pressure sensing device such as an array of pressure transducers positioned at the ocean floor below water level and at a location of wave movement for i registering changes in height of water above the pressure sensing device and ii providing a power output corresponding to changes in force associated with the changes in the height of water. A transfer medium is coupled at one end to the pressure sensing device and extends underground to a second end at a shore location adjacent the location of wave movement for transmitting the power output of the pressure sensing device to the shore location. A bank of storage batteries is coupled to the transfer medium at the shore location for receiving the power output from the transfer medium and for storing the power output as a useful form of energy.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 438 242 issued Aug. 20 2002 to Howarth discloses an electro acoustic transducer in which a plurality of cymbal type electro acoustic actuators are disposed in mechanical and electrical parallel between a pair of stiff plates. The resultant transducer resonates at a lower frequency than the cymbals with a greater generated force. An example of a plurality of cymbal type transducers is shown in .

U.S. Pat. No. 6 737 789 issued May 18 2004 to Radziemski et al. discloses a force activated electrical power generator using piezoelectric elements of preferred lead magnesium niobate lead titanate PMN PT . The circuitry is in preferred versions completely passive generating all power needed. Some circuitry limits voltage across the elements and provides a return charge channel to prevent depolarization. Transformers can be used to increase the output voltage and efficiency. Rectifiers are shown to rectify the output to a single polarity. Filtering regulation and other conditioning components are also shown. The output from the generator and circuitry can store the electrical charge such as in a capacitor and or battery.

U.S. Pat. No. 7 157 802 issued Jan. 2 2007 to Bodkin discloses an electrical power source that derives input power from a compressed gas which is fed into a transducer generating electrical power. The compressed gas may be delivered to the unit by several means including manual pumps thermal chemical or ammunition based sources or connection to pressurized canisters. Optional power converting and feedback circuits and pneumatic valves serve to convert the raw output power into useful AC and DC output voltages and to match the rate of power delivery to the applied electrical load.

U.S. Pat. No. 7 239 066 issued Jul. 3 2007 to Ott et al. discloses a piezoelectric power generator that comprises a plurality of piezoelectric devices an actuator positioned to impart an excitation to the plurality of piezoelectric devices in a predefined sequence and an electrical conduction system connected to the plurality of piezoelectric devices for conducting an electrical charge created by the excitation. Preferably the plurality of piezoelectric devices are arranged in a predetermined relationship relative to the actuator whereby only one of the plurality of piezoelectric devices is actuated at a time. For example the plurality of piezoelectric devices can be arranged in an angular pattern such as a circular pattern relative to the actuator. Preferably a rotational speed of the actuator 24 permits an excitation response for a given piezoelectric device to essentially fully decay before the given piezoelectric device is again excited.

U.S. Pat. No. 7 260 984 issued Aug. 28 2007 to Roundy et al. discloses a method of powering one or more electronic devices in a tire monitoring system using a tire pressure based energy scavenger. With this method a tire is rotated on a surface to generate pressure changes within the tire. These pressure changes are then converted into electrical energy with a transducer and the energy is stored. The electrical energy or stored electrical energy can then be used to power one or more electronic devices in a tire monitoring system such as a tire pressure sensor temperature sensor acceleration profile sensor and or a tire wear monitor. A tire monitoring system with a tire pressure based energy scavenger is also provided.

Electrical contacts are joined to each surface of disk . If made of metal cymbals A and B can provide this electrical contact. However cymbals A and B can be used to provide mechanical to support electrical contacts such as wires and the like regardless of the material of which cymbals A and B are comprised. There is a gas filled gap between each cymbal A and B and the surface of disk .

Wiring to interconnect the transducers may connect the transducers in parallel if greater current output is desired or in parallel to increase the voltage output. In one possible embodiment outputs of cymbal transducers for each column may be connected in series and the resulting outputs of each column may be connected in parallel. For example if metal material is utilized for cymbals A and B as shown if then this metal material may also be utilized to complete the circuit to provide a series connection between outputs of cymbal transducers in each column. If plates are metal then the outputs of each column are then in parallel.

Other wiring arrangements might also be utilized. To produce a relatively higher voltage cymbal transducers for each column may be connected in series as discussed above and then the outputs of each column may be connected in series with interconnecting wires between plates . In this manner the voltage produced may be equal to the voltage output of each cymbal transducer multiplied by the number of transducers in an array.

Further embodiments of this invention are envisioned that involve parallel and serial arrangements of cymbal transducers that could be tailored to the specific use. Serial arrangements can provide power when larger forces and translations are available. Larger transducers are more suited to low frequency usage. Cymbal transducer size can vary with the use.

It is suggested that this invention can be used in remote locations where electrical power is difficult to provide to a device. Two suggested applications are for capturing energy generated during walking and as a manual squeeze power source.
