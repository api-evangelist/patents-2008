The present invention relates generally to the lowering raising and control of the temperature of the human body. More particularly the invention relates to a method and intravascular apparatus for controlling the temperature of the human body.

Background Information Organs in the human body such as the brain kidney and heart are maintained at a constant temperature of approximately 37 C. Hypothermia can be clinically defined as a core body temperature of 35 C. or less. Hypothermia is sometimes characterized further according to its severity. A body core temperature in the range of 33 C. to 35 C. is described as mild hypothermia. A body temperature of 28 C. to 32 C. is described as moderate hypothermia. A body core temperature in the range of 24 C. to 28 C. is described as severe hypothermia.

Hypothermia is uniquely effective in reducing ischemia. For example it is effective in reducing brain injury caused by a variety of neurological insults and may eventually play an important role in emergency brain resuscitation. Experimental evidence has demonstrated that cerebral cooling improves outcome after global ischemia focal ischemia or traumatic brain injury. For this reason hypothermia may be induced in order to reduce the effect of certain bodily injuries to the brain as well as ischemic injuries to other organs.

The apparatus of the present invention can include a heat transfer element which can be used to apply cooling to the blood flowing in a vessel. The heat transfer element by way of example only comprises first and second elongated articulated segments each segment having a turbulence inducing exterior surface. A flexible joint can connect the first and second elongated segments. An inner coaxial lumen may be disposed within the first and second elongated segments and is capable of transporting a working fluid to a distal end of the first elongated segment. In addition the first and second elongated segments may have a turbulence inducing interior surface for inducing turbulence within the pressurized working fluid. The turbulence inducing exterior surface may be adapted to induce turbulence within a free stream of blood flow when placed within an artery or vein. The turbulence inducing exterior surface may be adapted to induce a turbulence intensity greater than 0.05 within a free stream blood flow. In one embodiment the flexible joint comprises a bellows section which also allows for axial compression of the heat transfer element.

In an embodiment the turbulence inducing exterior surfaces of the heat transfer element comprise one or more helical ridges. Adjacent segments of the heat transfer element can be oppositely spiraled to increase turbulence. For instance the first elongated heat transfer segment may comprise one or more helical ridges having a counter clockwise twist while the second elongated heat transfer segment comprises one or more helical ridges having a clockwise twist. Alternatively of course the first elongated heat transfer segment may comprise one or more clockwise helical ridges and the second elongated heat transfer segment may comprise one or more counter clockwise helical ridges. The first and second elongated articulated segments may be formed from highly conductive materials.

The heat transfer device may also have a coaxial supply catheter with an inner catheter lumen coupled to the inner coaxial lumen within the first and second elongated heat transfer segments. A working fluid supply configured to dispense the pressurized working fluid may be coupled to the inner catheter lumen. The working fluid supply may be configured to produce the pressurized working fluid at a temperature of about 0 C. and at a pressure below about 5 atmospheres of pressure. The working fluid may be isolyte saline D5W etc.

In yet another alternative embodiment the heat transfer device may have three or more elongated articulated heat transfer segments having a turbulence inducing exterior surface with additional flexible joints connecting the additional elongated heat transfer segments. In one such embodiment by way of example the first and third elongated heat transfer segments may comprise clockwise helical ridges and the second elongated heat transfer segment may comprise one or more counter clockwise helical ridges. Alternatively of course the first and third elongated heat transfer segments may comprise counter clockwise helical ridges and the second elongated heat transfer segment may comprise one or more clockwise helical ridges.

The turbulence inducing exterior surface of the heat transfer element may optionally include a surface coating or treatment to inhibit clot formation.

The present invention also envisions a method of cooling the body which comprises inserting a flexible conductive cooling element into the inferior vena cava from a distal location and providing a means of warming die body to prevent shivering by means of a cooling blanket. The method further includes circulating a working fluid through the flexible conductive cooling element in order to lower the temperature of the body. The flexible conductive heat transfer element absorbs more than about 25 50 or 75 Watts of heat.

The method may also comprise inducing turbulence within die free stream blood flow within an artery or vein. In one embodiment the method includes the step of inducing blood turbulence with a turbulence intensity greater than about 0.05 within the vascular system. The circulating may comprise inducing mixing flow of the working fluid through the flexible conductive heat transfer element. The pressure of the working fluid may be maintained below about 5 atmospheres of pressure.

The cooling or warning may comprise circulating a working fluid in through an inner lumen in the catheter and out through an outer coaxial lumen. In one embodiment the working fluid remains a liquid throughout the cycle. The working fluid may be aqueous.

The present invention also envisions a cooling or warming catheter comprising a catheter shaft having first and second lumens therein. The catheter also comprises a cooling or warming tip adapted to transfer heat to or from a working fluid circulated in through the first lumen and out through the second lumen and turbulence inducing structures on the tip capable of inducing free stream turbulence when the tip is inserted into a blood vessel. The tip may be adapted to induce turbulence within the working fluid. The catheter is capable of removing at least about 25 Watts of heat from an organ when inserted into a vessel supplying that organ while cooling the tip with a working fluid that remains a liquid in the catheter. Alternatively the catheter is capable of removing at least about 50 or 75 Watts of heat from an organ when inserted into a vessel supplying that organ while cooling the tip with an aqueous working fluid.

In another embodiment a cooling or warming catheter may comprise a catheter shaft having first and second lumens therein a cooling or warming tip adapted to transfer heat to or from a working fluid circulated in through the first lumen and out through the second lumen and turbulence inducing structures on the tip capable of inducing turbulence when the tip is inserted into a blood vessel.

The present invention may also provide a temperature control apparatus comprising a flexible catheter which can be inserted through the vascular system of a patient to an artery or vein with an inflatable balloon heat exchanger near the distal end of the catheter. The present invention also encompasses a method for using such a device to perform cooling heating or temperature management. After placement in a vessel an embodiment of the invention includes an apparatus where the heat exchanger balloon is inflated by pressurization with a working fluid such as saline isolyte D5W or other similar fluids or combinations of these via a supply lumen in the catheter. The heat exchanger balloon has one or more blood passageways passing through it from a proximal aspect of the balloon to a distal aspect of the balloon. When the heat exchanger balloon is inflated to contact the wall of the artery in which it is placed each of the blood passageways comprises a tube having an inlet in one face of the heat exchanger balloon and an outlet in another face of the heat exchanger balloon thereby allowing blood to continue flowing through the artery after inflation of the balloon. The blood passageway tubes can be constructed of a material having a relatively high thermal conductivity such as a thin metallized polymer such as a film with one or more metallized surfaces. Alternatively the blood passageway tubes can be constructed of a metal loaded polymer film. Further the entire heat exchanger balloon can be constructed of such a material in order to maximize the cooling capacity of the heat exchanger.

After inflation of the heat exchanger balloon the saline solution which is chilled by an external chiller continues circulating through the interior of the heat exchanger balloon around the blood passageway tubes and back out of the balloon through a return lumen in the catheter. This cools the blood passageway tubes which in turn cool the blood flowing through them. This cooled blood then flows through the selected organ and cools the organ.

The device can also incorporate a lumen for a guidewire facilitating the navigation of the catheter through the vascular system of the patient.

In one aspect the invention is directed to a catheter system to change the temperature of blood by heat transfer to or from a working fluid. The system includes an inflatable inlet lumen and outlet lumen. The outlet lumen is coupled to the inlet lumen so as to transfer working fluid between the two. The outlet lumen has a structure when inflated to induce turbulence in the blood and or in the working fluid.

Variations of the system may include one or more of the following. The inlet lumen and the outlet lumen may be made of a flexible material such as latex rubber. The outlet lumen may have a structure to induce turbulence in the working fluid when inflated such as a helical shape which may be tapered in a segmented or non segmented manner. The radii of the inlet and outlet lumens may decrease in a distal direction such that the inlet and outlet lumens are tapered when inflated. A wire may be disposed in the inlet or outlet lumens to provide shape and strength when deflated.

The thickness of the outlet lumen when inflated may be less than about mil. The length of the inlet lumen may be between about 5 and 30 centimeters. If the outlet lumen has a helical shape the diameter of the helix may be less than about 8 millimeters when inflated. The outer diameter of the helix of the outlet lumen when inflated may be between about 2 millimeters and 8 millimeters and may taper to between about 1 millimeter and 2 millimeters. In segmented embodiments a length of a segment may be between about 1 centimeter and 10 centimeters. The radii of the inlet and outlet lumens when inflated may be between about 0.5 millimeters and 2 millimeters.

The outlet lumen may further include at least one surface feature and or interior feature the surface feature inducing turbulence in the fluid adjacent the outlet lumen and the interior feature inducing turbulence in the working fluid. The surface feature may include one or more helical turns or spirals formed in the outlet lumen. Adjacent turns may employ opposite helicity. Alternatively or in combination the surface feature may be a series of staggered protrusions formed in the outlet lumen.

The turbulence inducing outlet lumen may be adapted to induce turbulence when inflated within a free stream of blood when placed within an artery. The turbulence intensity may be greater than about 0.05. The turbulence inducing outlet lumen may be adapted to induce turbulence when inflated throughout the period of the cardiac cycle when placed within an artery or during at least 20 of the period.

The system may further include a coaxial supply catheter having an inner catheter lumen coupled to the inlet lumen and a working fluid supply configured to dispense the working fluid and having an output coupled to the inner catheter lumen. The working fluid supply may be configured to produce a pressurized working fluid at a temperature of between about 3 C. and 36 C. and at a pressure below about 5 atmospheres of pressure. Higher temperatures may be employed if blood heating is desired.

The turbulence inducing outlet lumen may include a surface coating or treatment such as heparin to inhibit clot formation. A stent may be coupled to the distal end of the inlet lumen. The system may be employed to cool or heat volumes of tissue rather than blood.

In embodiments employing a tapered helical outlet lumen the taper of the outlet lumen allows the outlet lumen to be placed in an artery having a radius less than the first radius. The outlet lumen may be tapered in segments. The segments may be separated by joints the joints having a radius less than that of either adjacent segment.

In another aspect the invention is directed to a method of changing the temperature of blood by heat transfer. The method includes inserting an inflatable heat transfer element into an artery or vein and inflating the same by delivering a working fluid to its interior. The temperature of the working fluid is generally different from that of the blood. The method further includes inducing turbulence in the working fluid by passing the working fluid through a turbulence inducing path such that turbulence is induced in a substantial portion of a free stream of blood. The inflatable heat transfer element may have a turbulence inducing structure when inflated.

In another aspect the invention is directed towards a method of treating the brain which includes inserting a flexible heat transfer element into an artery from a distal location and circulating a working fluid through the flexible heat transfer element to inflate the same and to selectively modify the temperature of an organ without significantly modifying the temperature of the entire body. The flexible conductive heat transfer element preferably absorbs more than about 25 50 or 75 watts of heat. The artery may be the common carotid or a combination of the common carotid and the internal carotid.

In another aspect the invention is directed towards a method for selectively cooling an organ in the body of a patient which includes introducing a catheter into a blood vessel supplying the organ the catheter having a diameter of 5 mm or less inducing free stream turbulence in blood flowing over the catheter and cooling the catheter to remove heat from the blood to cool the organ without substantially cooling the entire body. In one embodiment the cooling removes at least about 75 watts of heat from the blood. In another embodiment the cooling removes at least about 100 watts of heat from the blood. The organ being cooled may be the human brain.

The circulating may further include passing the working fluid in through an inlet lumen and out through an outlet coaxial lumen. The working fluid may be a liquid at or well below its boiling point and furthermore may be aqueous.

Advantages of the invention include one or more of the following. The design criteria described above for the heat transfer element small diameter when deflated large diameter when inflated high flexibility and enhanced heat transfer rate through increases in the surface of the heat transfer element and the creation of turbulent flow facilitate creation of a heat transfer element which successfully achieves selective organ cooling or heating. Because the blood is cooled intravascularly or in situ problems associated with external circulation of the blood are eliminated. Also only a single puncture and arterial vessel cannulation are required which may be performed at an easily accessible artery such as the femoral subclavian or brachial arteries. By eliminating the use of a cold perfusate problems associated with excessive fluid accumulation are avoided. In addition rapid cooling to a precise temperature may be achieved. Further treatment of a patient is not cumbersome and the patient may easily receive continued care during the heat transfer process. The device and method may be easily combined with other devices and techniques to provide aggressive multiple therapies.

A fourteenth aspect of the present invention involves a method of heating or cooling a surrounding fluid in a blood vessel. The method includes providing a device for heating or cooling a surrounding fluid in a blood vessel within the blood stream of a blood vessel the device including an elongated catheter body a heat transfer element located at a distal portion of the catheter body and including an interior portion adapted to induce mixing of a working fluid to effect heat transfer between the heat transfer element and working fluid an elongated supply lumen member located within the catheter body and adapted to deliver the working fluid to the interior of the heat transfer element an elongated return lumen member located within the catheter body and adapted to return the working fluid from the interior of the heat transfer element and a mixing enhancing mechanism located within the heat transfer element and adapted to further mix the working fluid to effect further heat transfer between the heat transfer element and working fluid causing a working fluid to flow to and along the interior portion of the heat transfer element of the device using the supply lumen and return lumen facilitating the transfer of heat between the working fluid and the heat transfer element by effecting mixing of the working fluid with the interior portion adapted to induce mixing of a working fluid facilitating additional transfer of heat between the working fluid and the heat transfer element by effecting further mixing of the working fluid with the interior portion with the mixing enhancing mechanism causing heat to be transferred between the blood stream and the heat transfer element by the heat transferred between the heat transfer element and working fluid.

In the following description the term pressure communication is used to describe a situation between two points in a flow or in a standing fluid. If pressure is applied at one point the second point will eventually feel effects of the pressure if the two points are in pressure communication. Any number of valves or elements may be disposed between the two points and the two points may still be in pressure communication if the above test is met. For example for a standing fluid in a pipe any number of pipe fittings may be disposed between two pipes and so long as an open path is maintained points in the respective pipes may still be in pressure communication.

A one or two step process and a one or two piece device may be employed to intravascularly lower the temperature of a body in order to induce therapeutic hypothermia. A cooling element may be placed in a high flow vein such as the vena cavae to absorb heat from the blood flowing into the heart. This transfer of heat causes a cooling of the blood flowing through the heart and thus throughout the vasculature. Such a method and device may therapeutically be used to induce an artificial state of hypothermia.

A heat transfer element that systemically cools blood should be capable of providing the necessary heat transfer rate to produce the desired cooling effect throughout the vasculature. This may be up to or greater than 300 watts and is at least partially dependent on the mass of the patient and the rate of blood flow. Surface features may be employed on the heat transfer element to enhance the heat transfer rate. The surface features and other components of the heat transfer element are described in more detail below.

One problem with hypothermia as a therapy is that the patient s thermoregulatory defenses initiate attempting to defeat the hypothermia. Methods and devices may be used to lessen the thermoregulatory response. For example a heating blanket may cover the patient. In this way the patient may be made more comfortable. Thermoregulatory drugs may also be employed to lower the trigger point at which the patient s thermoregulatory system begins to initiate defenses. Such drugs are described in more detail below. A method employing thermoregulatory drugs heating blankets and heat transfer elements is also disclosed below.

The internal jugular vein is the vein that directly drains the brain. The external jugular joins the internal jugular at the base of the neck. The internal jugular veins join the subclavian veins to form the brachiocephalic veins that in turn drain into the superior vena cava. The superior vena cava drains into the right atrium of the heart as may be seen by referring ahead to . The superior vena cava supplies blood to the heart from the upper part of the body.

A cooling element may be placed into the superior vena cava inferior vena cava or otherwise into a vein which feeds into the superior vena cava or otherwise into the heart to cool the body. A physician percutaneously places the catheter into the subclavian or internal or external jugular veins to access the superior vena cava. The blood cooled by the heat transfer element may be processed by the heart and provided to the body in oxygenated form to be used as a conductive medium to cool the body. The lungs have a fairly low heat capacity and thus the lungs do not cause appreciable rewarming of the flowing blood.

The vasculature by its very nature provides preferential blood flow to the high blood flow organs such as the brain and the heart. Thus these organs are preferentially cooled by such a procedure as is also shown experimentally in . is a graph of measured temperature plotted versus cooling time. This graph shows the effect of placing a cooling element in the superior vena cavae of a sheep. The core body temperature as measured by an esophageal probe is shown by curve . The brain temperature is shown by curve . The brain temperature is seen to decrease more rapidly than the core body temperature throughout the experiment. The inventors believe this effect to be due to the preferential supply of blood provided to the brain and heart. This effect may be even more pronounced if thermoregulatory effects such as vasoconstriction occur that tend to focus blood supply to the core vascular system and away from the peripheral vascular system.

When a heat transfer element is inserted approximately coaxially into an artery or vein the primary mechanism of heat transfer between the surface of the heat transfer element and the blood is forced convection. Convection relies upon the movement of fluid to transfer heat. Forced convection results when an external force causes motion within the fluid. In the case of arterial or venous flow the beating heart causes the motion of the blood around the heat transfer element.

The magnitude of the heat transfer rate is proportional to the surface area of the heat transfer element the temperature differential and the heat transfer coefficient of the heat transfer element.

The receiving artery or vein into which the heat transfer element is placed has a limited diameter and length. Thus the surface area of the heat transfer element must be limited to avoid significant obstruction of the artery or vein and to allow the heat transfer element to easily pass through the vascular system. For placement within the superior vena cava via the external jugular the cross sectional diameter of the heat transfer element may be limited to about 5 6 mm and its length may be limited to approximately 10 15 cm. For placement within the inferior vena cava the cross sectional diameter of the heat transfer element may be limited to about 6 7 mm and its length may be limited to approximately 25 35 cm.

Decreasing the surface temperature of the heat transfer element can increase the temperature differential. However the minimum allowable surface temperature is limited by the characteristics of blood. Blood freezes at approximately 0 C. When the blood approaches freezing ice emboli may form in the blood which may lodge downstream causing serious ischemic injury. Furthermore reducing the temperature of the blood also increases its viscosity which results in a small decrease in the value of the convection heat transfer coefficient. In addition increased viscosity of the blood may result in an increase in the pressure drop within the artery thus compromising the flow of blood to the brain. Given the above constraints it is advantageous to limit the minimum allowable surface temperature of the cooling element to approximately 5 C. This results in a maximum temperature differential between the blood stream and the cooling element of approximately 32 C. For other physiological reasons there are limits on the maximum allowable surface temperature of the warming element.

The mechanisms by which the value of the convection heat transfer coefficient may be increased are complex. However it is well known that the convection heat transfer coefficient increases with the level of mixing or turbulent kinetic energy in the fluid flow. Thus it is advantageous to have blood flow with a high degree of mixing in contact with the heat transfer element.

The blood flow has a considerably more stable flux in the superior vena cava than in an artery. However the blood flow in the superior vena cava still has a high degree of inherent mixing or turbulence. Reynolds numbers in the superior vena cava may range for example from 2 000 to 5 000. Thus blood cooling in the superior vena cava may benefit from enhancing the level of mixing with the heat transfer element but this benefit may be substantially less than that caused by the inherent mixing.

A thin boundary layer has been shown to form during the cardiac cycle. Boundary layers develop adjacent to the heat transfer element as well as next to the walls of the artery or vein. Each of these boundary layers has approximately the same thickness as the boundary layer that would have developed at the wall of the artery in the absence of the heat transfer element. The free stream flow region is developed in an annular ring around the heat transfer element. The heat transfer element used in such a vessel should reduce the formation of such viscous boundary layers.

The intravascular heat transfer element should be flexible in order to be placed within the vena cavae or other veins or arteries. The flexibility of the heat transfer element is an important characteristic because the same is typically inserted into a vein such as the external jugular and accesses the superior vena cava by initially passing though a series of one or more branches. Further the heat transfer element is ideally constructed from a highly thermally conductive material such as metal in order to facilitate heat transfer. The use of a highly thermally conductive material increases the heat transfer rate for a given temperature differential between the working fluid within the heat transfer element and the blood. This facilitates the use of a higher temperature coolant or lower temperature warming fluid within the heat transfer element allowing safer working fluids such as water or saline to be used. Highly thermally conductive materials such as metals tend to be rigid. Therefore the design of the heat transfer element should facilitate flexibility in an inherently inflexible material.

It is estimated that the cooling element should absorb at least about 300 Watts of heat when placed in the superior vena cava to lower the temperature of the body to between about 30 C. and 34 C. These temperatures are thought to be appropriate to obtain the benefits of hypothermia described above. The power removed determines how quickly the target temperature can be reached. For example in a stroke therapy in which it is desired to lower brain temperature the same may be lowered about 4 C. per hour in a 70 kg human upon removal of 300 Watts.

One embodiment of the invention uses a modular design. This design creates helical blood flow and produces a level of mixing in the blood flow by periodically forcing abrupt changes in the direction of the helical blood flow. The abrupt changes in flow direction are achieved through the use of a series of two or more heat transfer segments each included of one or more helical ridges. The use of periodic abrupt changes in the helical direction of the blood flow in order to induce strong free stream turbulence may be illustrated with reference to a common clothes washing machine. The rotor of a washing machine spins initially in one direction causing laminar flow. When the rotor abruptly reverses direction significant turbulent kinetic energy is created within the entire wash basin as the changing currents cause random turbulent motion within the clothes water slurry. These surface features also tend to increase the surface area of the heat transfer element further enhancing heat transfer.

A heat transfer element with a smooth exterior surface may be able to provide the desired amount of heat transfer. However as noted above it is well known that the convection heat transfer coefficient increases with the level of turbulent kinetic energy in the fluid flow. Thus if flow past a smooth heat transfer element will not transfer sufficient heat it is advantageous to have turbulent or otherwise mixed blood flow in contact with the heat transfer element.

Under constant pressure conditions steady flows in pipes are characterized as a balance between viscous stresses and the constant pressure gradient. Such flows are called Poiseuillean. is a velocity profile diagram showing a typical steady state Poiseuillean flow driven by a constant pressure gradient. The velocity of the fluid across the pipe is shown in by the parabolic curve and corresponding velocity vectors. The velocity of the fluid in contact with the wall of the pipe is zero. The boundary layer is the region of the flow in contact with the pipe surface in which viscous stresses are dominant. In steady state Poiseuillean flow the boundary layer develops until it includes the whole pipe i.e. the boundary layer thickness in is one half of the diameter of the pipe.

Under conditions of Poiseuillean flow the Reynolds number the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces can be used to characterize the level of turbulent kinetic energy existing in the flow. For Poiseuillean flows Reynolds numbers must be greater than about 2300 to cause a transition from laminar to turbulent flow. Further when the Reynolds number is greater than about 2000 the boundary layer is receptive to tripping . Tripping is a process by which a small perturbation in the boundary layer can create turbulent conditions. The receptivity of a boundary layer to tripping is proportional to the Reynolds number and is nearly zero for Reynolds numbers less than 2000.

In contrast with the steady Poiseuillean flow the blood flow in arteries is induced by the beating heart and is therefore pulsatile. The below description of this pulsatile flow referring to thus describes the situation when a heat transfer element is inserted into an artery. is a graph showing the velocity of the blood flow within an artery as a function of time. The beating heart provides pulsatile flow with an approximate period of 0.5 to 1 second. This is known as the period of the cardiac cycle. The horizontal axis in represents time in seconds and the vertical axis represents the average velocity of blood in centimeters per second. Although very high velocities are reached at the peak of the pulse the high velocity occurs for only a small portion of the cycle. In fact the velocity of the blood reaches zero in the carotid artery at the end of a pulse and temporarily reverses.

Because of the relatively short duration of the cardiac pulse the blood flow in the arteries does not develop into the classic Poiseuillean flow. is a velocity profile diagram showing blood flow velocity within an artery averaged over the cardiac pulse. The majority of the flow within the artery has the same velocity. The boundary layer where the flow velocity decays from the free stream value to zero is very thin typically to 1 20 of the diameter of the artery as opposed to one half of the diameter of the artery in the Poiseuillean flow condition.

As noted above if the flow in the artery were steady rather than pulsatile the transition from laminar to turbulent flow would occur when the value of the Reynolds number exceeds about 2 000. However in the pulsatile arterial flow the value of the Reynolds number varies during the cardiac cycle just as the flow velocity varies. In pulsatile flows due to the enhanced stability associated with the acceleration of the free stream flow the critical value of the Reynolds number at which the unstable modes of motion grow into turbulence is found to be much higher perhaps as high as 9 000.

The blood flow in the arteries of interest remains laminar over more than 80 of the cardiac cycle. Referring again to the blood flow is turbulent from approximately time tuntil time tduring a small portion of the descending systolic flow which is less than 20 of the period of the cardiac cycle. If a heat transfer element is placed inside the artery heat transfer will be facilitated during this short interval. However to transfer the necessary heat to selectively cool the brain in arterial embodiments turbulent kinetic energy should be produced in the blood stream and sustained throughout the entire period of the cardiac cycle.

A thin boundary layer has been shown to form during the cardiac cycle. This boundary layer will form over the surface of a smooth heat transfer element. is a velocity profile diagram showing blood flow velocity within an artery averaged over the cardiac pulse after insertion of a smooth heat transfer element within the artery. In the diameter of the heat transfer element is about one half of the diameter of the artery. Boundary layers develop adjacent to the heat transfer element as well as next to the walls of the artery. Each of these boundary layers has approximately the same thickness as the boundary layer which would have developed at the wall of the artery in the absence of the heat transfer element. The free stream flow region is developed in an annular ring around the heat transfer element. Blood flow past such a smooth heat transfer element may transfer sufficient heat to accomplish the desired temperature control.

One way to increase the heat transfer rate is to create a turbulent boundary layer on the heat transfer element surface. However turbulence in the very thin boundary layer will not produce sufficient kinetic energy to produce the necessary heat transfer rate. Therefore to induce sufficient turbulent kinetic energy to increase the heat transfer rate sufficiently to cool the brain a stirring mechanism which abruptly changes the direction of velocity vectors should be utilized. This can create high levels of turbulence intensity in the free stream thereby sufficiently increasing the heat transfer rate.

This turbulence intensity should ideally be sustained for a significant portion of the cardiac cycle. Further turbulent kinetic energy should ideally be created throughout the free stream and not just in the boundary layer. is a graph illustrating the velocity of continually turbulent flow under pulsatile conditions as a function of time which would result in optimal heat transfer in arterial blood flow. Turbulent velocity fluctuations are seen throughout the cycle as opposed to the short interval of fluctuations seen in between time tand time t. These velocity fluctuations are found within the free stream. The turbulence intensity shown in is at least 0.05. In other words the instantaneous velocity fluctuations deviate from the mean velocity by at least 5 . Although ideally turbulence or mixing is created throughout the entire period of the cardiac cycle the benefits of turbulence are also obtained if the turbulence or mixing is sustained for only 75 50 or even as low as 30 or 20 of the cardiac cycle.

To create the desired level of turbulence intensity or mixing in the blood free stream during the whole cardiac cycle one embodiment of the invention uses a modular design. This design creates helical blood flow and produces a high level of mixing in the free stream.

For a swirling flow in a tube in which the azimuthal velocity of the fluid vanishes toward the stationary outer boundary any non vanishing azimuthal velocity in the interior of the flow will result in an instability in which the inner fluid is spontaneously exchanged with fluid near the wall analogous to Taylor cells in the purely azimuthal flow between a rotating inner cylinder and stationary outer cylinder. This instability results from the lack of any force in opposition to the centripetal acceleration of the fluid particles moving along helical paths the pressure in the tube being a function only of longitudinal position. In one embodiment the device of the present invention imparts an azimuthal velocity to the interior of a developed pipe flow with the net result being a continuous exchange of fluid between the core and perimeter of the flow as it moves longitudinally down the pipe. This fluid exchange enhances the transport of heat effectively increasing the convective heat transfer coefficient over that which would have obtained in undisturbed pipe flow. This bulk exchange of fluid is not necessarily turbulent although turbulence is possible if the induced azimuthal velocity is sufficiently high.

The use of periodic abrupt changes in the helical direction of the blood flow in order to induce strong free stream turbulence or mixing may be illustrated with reference to a common clothes washing machine. The rotor of a washing machine spins initially in one direction causing laminar flow. When the rotor abruptly reverses direction significant turbulent kinetic energy is created within the entire wash basin as the changing currents cause random turbulent mixing motion within the clothes water slurry.

A device according to an embodiment of the invention for accomplishing such cooling or heating is shown schematically in which shows a vessel wall in which a blood flow is passing. A catheter is disposed within the blood flow to affect the blood temperature. Catheter has an inlet lumen for providing a working fluid and an outlet lumen for draining the working fluid . The functions of the respective lumens may of course be opposite to that stated. A reverse configuration may be particularly advantageous when blood heating rather than blood cooling is the objective.

Once the materials for the lumens and the working fluid are chosen the conductive heat transfers are solely dependent on the temperature gradients. Convective heat transfers by contrast also rely on the movement of fluid to transfer heat. Forced convection results when the heat transfer surface is in contact with a fluid whose motion is induced or forced by a pressure gradient area variation or other such force. In the case of arterial flow the beating heart provides an oscillatory pressure gradient to force the motion of the blood in contact with the heat transfer surface. One of the aspects of the device uses turbulence to enhance this forced convective heat transfer.

The rate of convective heat transfer Q is proportional to the product of S the area of the heat transfer element in direct contact with the fluid T T T the temperature differential between the surface temperature Tof the heat transfer element and the free stream blood temperature T and the average convection heat transfer coefficient over the heat transfer area. is sometimes called the surface coefficient of heat transfer or the convection heat transfer coefficient .

The magnitude of the heat transfer rate Q to or from the fluid flow can be increased through manipulation of the above three parameters. Practical constraints limit the value of these parameters and how much they can be manipulated. For example the internal diameter of the common carotid artery ranges from 6 to 8 mm. Thus the heat transfer element residing therein may not be much larger than 4 mm in diameter to avoid occluding the vessel. The length of the heat transfer element should also be limited. For placement within the internal and common carotid artery the length of the heat transfer element is limited to about 10 cm. This estimate is based on the length of the common carotid artery which ranges from 8 to 12 cm. Embodiments intended for use in the venous system would be analyzed similarly.

Consequently the value of the surface area S is limited by the physical constraints imposed by the size of the artery into which the device is placed. Surface features such as fins can be used to increase the surface area of the heat transfer element however these features alone cannot usually provide enough surface area enhancement to meet the required heat transfer rate. An embodiment of the device described below provides a tapered heat transfer element which employs a large surface area but which may advantageously fit into small arteries and veins. As the device is inflatable the same may be inserted in relatively small arteries and veins in a deflated state allowing a minimally invasive entry. When the device is in position the same may be inflated allowing a large surface area and thus an enhanced heat transfer rate.

One may also attempt to vary the magnitude of the heat transfer rate by varying T. The value of T T Tcan be varied by varying the surface temperature Tof the heat transfer element. The allowable surface temperature of the heat transfer element is limited by the characteristics of blood. The blood temperature is fixed at about 37 C. and blood freezes at approximately 0 C. When the blood approaches freezing ice emboli may form in the blood which may lodge downstream causing serious ischemic injury. Furthermore reducing the temperature of the blood also increases its viscosity which results in a small decrease in the value of . Increased viscosity of the blood may further result in an increase in the pressure drop within the vessel thus compromising the flow of blood. Given the above constraints it is advantageous to limit the surface temperature of the heat transfer element to approximately 1 C. 5 C. thus resulting in a maximum temperature differential between the blood stream and the heat transfer element of approximately 32 C. 36 C.

One may also attempt to vary the magnitude of the heat transfer rate by varying . Fewer constraints are imposed on the value of the convection heat transfer coefficient . The mechanisms by which the value of may be increased are complex. However one way to increase for a fixed mean value of the velocity is to increase the level of turbulent kinetic energy in the fluid flow.

The heat transfer rate Qin the absence of fluid flow is proportional to T the temperature differential between the surface temperature Tof the heat transfer element and the free stream blood temperature Ttimes k the diffusion constant and is inversely proportion to the thickness of the boundary layer.

The magnitude of the enhancement in heat transfer by fluid flow can be estimated by taking the ratio of the heat transfer rate with fluid flow to the heat transfer rate in the absence of fluid flow N Q Q k . This ratio is called the Nusselt number Nu . For convective heat transfer between blood and the surface of the heat transfer element Nusselt numbers of 30 80 have been found to be appropriate for selective cooling applications of various organs in the human body. Nusselt numbers are generally dependent on several other numbers the Reynolds number the Womersley number and the Prandtl number.

Stirring type mechanisms which abruptly change the direction of velocity vectors may be utilized to induce turbulent kinetic energy and increase the heat transfer rate. The level of turbulence so created is characterized by the turbulence intensity . Turbulence intensity is defined as the root mean square of the fluctuating velocity divided by the mean velocity. Such mechanisms can create high levels of turbulence intensity in the free stream thereby increasing the heat transfer rate. This turbulence intensity should ideally be sustained for a significant portion of the cardiac cycle and should ideally be created throughout the free stream and not just in the boundary layer.

Turbulence does occur for a short period in the cardiac cycle anyway. In particular the blood flow is turbulent during a small portion of the descending systolic flow. This portion is less than 20 of the period of the cardiac cycle. If a heat transfer element is placed co axially inside the artery the heat transfer rate will be enhanced during this short interval. For typical of these fluctuations the turbulence intensity is at least 0.05. In other words the instantaneous velocity fluctuations deviate from the mean velocity by at least 5 . Although ideally turbulence is created throughout the entire period of the cardiac cycle the benefits of turbulence are obtained if the turbulence is sustained for 75 50 or even as low as 30 or 20 of the cardiac cycle.

One type of turbulence inducing heat transfer element which may be advantageously employed to provide heating or cooling of an organ or volume is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 096 068 to Dobak and Lasheras for a Selective Organ Cooling Catheter and Method of Using the Same incorporated by reference above. In that application the heat transfer element is made of a high thermal conductivity material such as metal. The metal heat transfer element provides a high degree of heat transfer due to its high thermal conductivity. In that application bellows provided a high degree of articulation that compensated for the intrinsic stiffness of the metal. The device size was minimized e.g. less than 4 mm to prevent blockage of the blood flowing in the artery.

The type of flow that occurs is important because in laminar flow through a duct there is no mixing of warmer and colder fluid particles by eddy motion. Thus the only heat transfer that takes place is through conduction. Since most fluids have small thermal conductivities the heat transfer coefficients in laminar flow are relatively small. In transitional and turbulent flow mixing occurs through eddies that carry warmer fluid into cooler regions and vice versa. Since the mixing motion even if it is only on a small scale compared to fully turbulent flow accelerates the transfer of heat considerably a marked increase in the heat transfer coefficient occurs above a certain Reynolds number which in the graph of is about 2100. It can be seen from that it is at approximately this point where the Nusselt number increases more dramatically. A different set of numbers may be measured for blood flow through an artery or vein. However the inventors believe that a Nusselt number at least in the transitional region is important for enhanced heat transfer.

The first heat transfer segment is coupled to a second elongated heat transfer segment by a first bellows section which provides flexibility and compressibility. The second heat transfer segment includes one or more helical ridges with one or more helical grooves therebetween. The ridges and grooves have a right band or clockwise twist as they proceed toward the distal end of the heat transfer segment . The second heat transfer segment is coupled to a third elongated heat transfer segment by a second bellows section . The third heat transfer segment includes one or more helical ridges with one or more helical grooves therebetween. The helical ridge and the helical groove have a left hand or counter clockwise twist as they proceed toward the distal end of the heat transfer segment . Thus successive heat transfer segments of the heat transfer element alternate between having clockwise and counterclockwise helical twists. The actual left or right hand twist of any particular segment is immaterial as long as adjacent segments have opposite helical twist.

In addition the rounded contours of the ridges allow the heat transfer element to maintain a relatively atraumatic profile thereby minimizing the possibility of damage to the blood vessel wall. A heat transfer element according to the present invention may include two three or more heat transfer segments.

The bellows sections are formed from seamless and nonporous materials such as metal and therefore are impermeable to gas which can be particularly important depending on the type of working fluid that is cycled through the heat transfer element . The structure of the bellows sections allows them to bend extend and compress which increases the flexibility of the heat transfer element so that it is more readily able to navigate through blood vessels. The bellows sections also provide for axial compression of the heat transfer element which can limit the trauma when the distal end of the heat transfer element abuts a blood vessel wall. The bellows sections are also able to tolerate cryogenic temperatures without a loss of performance. In alternative embodiments the bellows may be replaced by flexible polymer tubes which are bonded between adjacent heat transfer segments.

The exterior surfaces of the heat transfer element can be made from metal and may include very high thermal conductivity materials such as nickel thereby facilitating heat transfer. Alternatively other metals such as stainless steel titanium aluminum silver copper and the like can be used with or without an appropriate coating or treatment to enhance biocompatibility or inhibit clot formation. Suitable biocompatible coatings include e.g. gold platinum or polymer paralyene. The heat transfer element may be manufactured by plating a thin layer of metal on a mandrel that has the appropriate pattern. In this way the heat transfer element may be manufactured inexpensively in large quantities which is an important feature in a disposable medical device.

Because the heat transfer element may dwell within the blood vessel for extended periods of time such as 24 48 hours or even longer it may be desirable to treat the surfaces of the heat transfer element to avoid clot formation. In particular one may wish to treat the bellows sections because stagnation of the blood flow may occur in the convolutions thus allowing clots to form and cling to the surface to form a thrombus. One means by which to prevent thrombus formation is to bind an antithrombogenic agent to the surface of the heat transfer element . For example heparin is known to inhibit clot formation and is also known to be useful as a biocoating. Alternatively the surfaces of the heat transfer element may be bombarded with ions such as nitrogen. Bombardment with nitrogen can harden and smooth the surface and thus prevent adherence of clotting factors. Another coating that provides beneficial properties may be a lubricious coating. Lubricious coatings on both the heat transfer element and its associated catheter allow for easier placement in the e.g. vena cava.

It is important to note that the same mechanisms that govern the heat transfer rate between the exterior surface of the heat transfer element and the blood also govern the heat transfer rate between the working fluid and the interior surface of the heat transfer element . The heat transfer characteristics of the interior surface are particularly important when using water saline or other fluid that remains a liquid as the working fluid. Other coolants such as Freon undergo nucleate boiling and create mixing through a different mechanism. Saline is a safe working fluid because it is non toxic and leakage of saline does not result in a gas embolism which could occur with the use of boiling refrigerants. Since mixing in the working fluid is enhanced by the shape of the interior surface of the heat transfer element the working fluid can be delivered to the cooling element at a warmer temperature and still achieve the necessary cooling rate. Similarly since mixing in the working fluid is enhanced by the shape of the interior surface of the heat transfer element the working fluid can be delivered to the warming element at a cooler temperature and still achieve the necessary warming rate.

This has a number of beneficial implications in the need for insulation along the catheter shaft length. Due to the decreased need for insulation the catheter shaft diameter can be made smaller. The enhanced heat transfer characteristics of the interior surface of the heat transfer element also allow the working fluid to be delivered to the heat transfer element at lower flow rates and lower pressures. High pressures may make the heat transfer element stiff and cause it to push against the wall of the blood vessel thereby shielding part of the exterior surface of the heat transfer element from the blood. Because of the increased heat transfer characteristics achieved by the alternating helical ridges the pressure of the working fluid may be as low as 5 atmospheres 3 atmospheres 2 atmospheres or even less than 1 atmosphere.

Referring back to the heat transfer element has been designed to address all of the design criteria discussed above. First the heat transfer element is flexible and is made of a highly conductive material. The flexibility is provided by a segmental distribution of bellows sections that provide an articulating mechanism. Bellows have a known convoluted design that provide flexibility. Second the exterior surface area has been increased through the use of helical ridges and helical grooves . The ridges also allow the heat transfer element to maintain a relatively atraumatic profile thereby minimizing the possibility of damage to the vessel wall. Third the heat transfer element has been designed to promote mixing both internally and externally. The modular or segmental design allows the direction of the grooves to be reversed between segments. The alternating helical rotations create an alternating flow that results in mixing the blood in a manner analogous to the mixing action created by the rotor of a washing machine that switches directions back and forth. This action is intended to promote mixing to enhance the heat transfer rate. The alternating helical design also causes beneficial mixing or turbulent kinetic energy of the working fluid flowing internally.

The first heat transfer segment is coupled to a second elongated heat transfer segment by a first flexible section such as a bellows section which provides flexibility and compressibility. Alternatively the flexible section may be a simple flexible tube very similar to a smooth heat transfer segment as addressed in but flexible. The second heat transfer segment also comprises a plurality of parallel longitudinal ridges with parallel longitudinal grooves therebetween. The longitudinal ridges and the longitudinal grooves of the second heat transfer segment are aligned parallel with the axis of the second heat transfer segment . The second heat transfer segment is coupled to a third elongated heat transfer segment by a second flexible section such as a bellows section or a flexible tube. The third heat transfer segment also comprises a plurality of parallel longitudinal ridges with parallel longitudinal grooves therebetween. The longitudinal ridges and the longitudinal grooves of the third heat transfer segment are aligned parallel with the axis of the third heat transfer segment . Further in this embodiment adjacent heat transfer segments of the heat transfer element have their longitudinal ridges aligned with each other and their longitudinal grooves aligned with each other.

In addition the rounded contours of the ridges also allow the heat transfer element to maintain a relatively atraumatic profile thereby minimizing the possibility of damage to the blood vessel wall. A heat transfer element according to the present invention may be comprised of two three or more heat transfer segments .

The bellows sections are formed from seamless and nonporous materials such as metal and therefore are impermeable to gas which can be particularly important depending on the type of working fluid which is cycled through the heat transfer element . The structure of the bellows sections allows them to bend extend and compress which increases the flexibility of the heat transfer element so that it is more readily able to navigate through blood vessels. The bellows sections also provide for axial compression of the heat transfer element which can limit the trauma when the distal end of the heat transfer element abuts a blood vessel wall. The bellows sections are also able to tolerate cryogenic temperatures without a loss of performance.

The first heat transfer segment is coupled to a second elongated heat transfer segment by a first flexible section such as a bellows section which provides flexibility and compressibility. Alternatively the flexible section may be a simple flexible tube very similar to a smooth heat transfer segment as shown in but flexible. The second heat transfer segment also comprises a plurality of parallel longitudinal ridges with parallel longitudinal grooves therebetween. The longitudinal ridges and the longitudinal grooves of the second heat transfer segment are aligned parallel with the axis of the second heat transfer segment . The second heat transfer segment is coupled to a third elongated heat transfer segment by a second flexible section such as a bellows section or a flexible tube. The third heat transfer segment also comprises a plurality of parallel longitudinal ridges with parallel longitudinal grooves therebetween. The longitudinal ridges and the longitudinal grooves of the third heat transfer segment are aligned parallel with the axis of the third heat transfer segment . Further in this embodiment adjacent heat transfer segments of the heat transfer element have their longitudinal ridges angularly offset from each other and their longitudinal grooves angularly offset from each other. Offsetting of the longitudinal ridges and the longitudinal grooves from each other on adjacent segments promotes turbulence or mixing in blood flowing past the exterior of the heat transfer element .

With reference to a catheter constructed in accordance with an alternative embodiment of the invention will now be described. The catheter includes an elongated catheter body with a heat transfer element located at a distal portion of the catheter body . The catheter includes a multiple lumen arrangement to deliver fluid to and from an interior of the heat transfer element and allow the catheter to be placed into a blood vessel over a guidewire. The heat transfer element includes turbulence inducing invaginations located on an exterior surface . Similar invaginations may be located on an interior surface of the heat transfer element but are not shown for clarity. Further it should be noted that the heat transfer element is shown with only four invaginations . Other embodiments may employ multiple elements connected by flexible joints or bellows as disclosed above. A single heat transfer element is shown in merely for clarity. In an alternative embodiment of the invention any of the other heat transfer elements described herein may replace heat transfer element . Alternatively the multi lumen arrangement may be used to deliver fluid to and from the interior of an operative element s other than a heat transfer element such as but without limitation a catheter balloon e.g. a dilatation balloon.

The catheter includes an integrated elongated multiple lumen member such as a bitumen member having a first lumen member and a second lumen member . The bitumen member has a substantially figure eight cross sectional shape and an outer surface with the same general shape. The first lumen member includes an interior surface defining a first lumen or guide wire lumen having a substantially circular cross sectional shape. The interior surface may be coated with a lubricious material to facilitate the sliding of the catheter over a guidewire. The first lumen member further includes a first exterior surface and a second exterior surface . The first lumen is adapted to receive a guide wire for placing the catheter into a blood vessel over the guidewire in a well known manner.

In the guide wire lumen is not coaxial with the catheter body . In an alternative embodiment of the invention the guide wire lumen may be coaxial with the catheter body .

The second lumen member includes a first interior surface and a second interior surface which is the same as the second exterior surface of the first lumen member that together define a second lumen or supply lumen having a substantially luniform cross sectional shape. The second lumen member further includes an exterior surface . The second lumen has a cross sectional area A. The second lumen is adapted to supply working fluid to the interior of the heat transfer element to provide temperature control of a flow or volume of blood in the manner described above.

The second lumen member terminates short of a distal end of the catheter leaving sufficient space for the working fluid to exit the supply lumen so it can contact the interior surface of the heat transfer element for heat transfer purposes.

Although the second lumen member is shown as a single supply lumen terminating adjacent the distal end of catheter to deliver working fluid at the distal end of the catheter with reference to in an alternative embodiment of the invention a single supply lumen member may include one or more outlet openings adjacent the distal end of the catheter and one or more outlet openings adjacent a mid point along the interior length of the heat transfer element . This arrangement improves the heat transfer characteristics of the heat transfer element because fresh working fluid at the same temperature is delivered separately to each segment of the interior of the heat transfer element instead of in series.

Although two heat transfer segments are shown it will be readily apparent that a number of heat transfer segments other than two e.g. one three four etc. may be used.

It will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that in another embodiment of the invention in addition to the one or more openings in the distal portion of the heat transfer element one or more openings at one or more locations may be located anywhere along the interior length of the heat transfer element proximal to the distal portion.

With reference to in an alternative embodiment of the invention first and second supply lumen members define respective first and second supply lumens for supplying working fluid to the interior of the heat transfer element . The first supply lumen terminates just short of the distal end of the catheter to deliver working fluid at the distal portion of the heat transfer element . The second supply lumen terminates short of the distal portion of the catheter for example at approximately a mid length point along the interior of the heat transfer element for delivering working fluid to the second heat transfer segment . In an alternative embodiment of the invention the second lumen member may terminate anywhere along the interior length of the heat transfer element proximal to the distal portion of the heat transfer element . Further a number of supply lumens greater than two may terminate along the interior length of the heat transfer element for delivering a working fluid at a variety of points along the interior length of the heat transfer element .

With reference back to the bitumen member is preferably extruded from a material such as polyurethane or Pebax. In an embodiment of the invention the bitumen member is extruded simultaneously with the catheter body . In an alternative embodiment of the invention the first lumen member and second lumen member are formed separately and welded or fixed together.

A third lumen or return lumen provides a convenient return path for working fluid. The third lumen is substantially defined by the interior surface of the heat transfer element an interior surface of the catheter body and the exterior surface of the bitumen member . The inventors have determined that the working fluid pressure drop through the lumens is minimized when the third lumen has a hydraulic diameter Dthat is equal to 0.75 of the hydraulic diameter Dof the second lumen . However the pressure drop that occurs when the ratio of the hydraulic diameter Dto the hydraulic diameter Dis substantially equal to 0.75 i.e. 0.75 0.10 works well. For flow through a cylinder the hydraulic diameter D of a lumen is equal to four times the cross sectional area of the lumen divided by the wetted perimeter. The wetted perimeter is the total perimeter of the region defined by the intersection of the fluid path through the lumen and a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the lumen. The wetted perimeter for the return lumen would include an inner wetted perimeter due to the outer surface of the bitumen member and an outer wetted perimeter due to the interior surface of the catheter body . The wetted perimeter for the supply lumen would include only an outer wetted perimeter due to the first and second interior surfaces of the bitumen member . Thus the wetted perimeter for a lumen depends on the number of boundary surfaces that define the lumen.

The third lumen is adapted to return working fluid delivered to the interior of the heat transfer element back to an external reservoir or the fluid supply for recirculation in a well known manner.

In an alternative embodiment the third lumen is the supply lumen and the second lumen is the return lumen. Accordingly it will be readily understood by the reader that adjectives such as first second etc. are used to facilitate the reader s understanding of the invention and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention especially as defined in the claims.

In a further embodiment of the invention the member may include a number of lumens other than two such as for example 1 3 4 5 etc. Additional lumens may be used as additional supply and or return lumens for other instruments e.g. imaging devices or for other purposes e.g. inflating a catheter balloon or delivering a drug.

Heating or cooling efficiency of the heat transfer element is optimized by maximizing the flow rate of working fluid through the lumens and minimizing the transfer of heat between the working fluid and the supply lumen member. Working fluid flow rate is maximized and pressure drop minimized in the present invention by having the ratio of the hydraulic diameter Dof the return lumen to the hydraulic diameter Dof the supply lumen equal to 0.75. However a ratio substantially equal to 0.75 i.e. 0.75 10 20 is acceptable. Heat transfer losses are minimized in the supply lumen by minimizing the surface area contact made between the bitumen member and the working fluid as it travels through the supply lumen member. The surface area of the supply lumen member that the supplied working fluid contacts is much less than that in co axial or concentric lumens used in the past because the supplied working fluid only contacts the interior of one lumen member compared to contacting the exterior of one lumen member and the interior of another lumen member. Thus heat transfer losses are minimized in the embodiments of the supply lumen in the multiple lumen member of the present invention.

It will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that the supply lumen and the return lumen may have cross sectional shapes other than those shown and described herein and still maintain the desired hydraulic diameter ratio of substantially 0.75. With reference to an example of a catheter including a supply lumen and a return lumen constructed in accordance with an alternative preferred embodiment of the invention where the hydraulic diameter ratio of the return lumen to the supply lumen is substantially equal to 0.75 is illustrated. It should be noted the same elements as those described above with respect to are identified with the same reference numerals and similar elements are identified with the same reference numerals but with a suffix.

The catheter illustrated in includes a multiple lumen arrangement for delivering working fluid to and from an interior of the heat transfer element and allowing the catheter to be placed into a blood vessel over a guide wire. The multiple lumen arrangement includes a bitumen member with a slightly different construction from the bi lumen member discussed above with respect to . Instead of an outer surface that is generally figure eight shaped the bitumen member has an outer surface that is circular. Consequently the third lumen has an annular cross sectional shape.

As discussed above maintaining the hydraulic diameter ratio of the return lumen to the supply lumen substantially equal to 0.75 maximizes the working fluid flow rate through the multiple lumen arrangement .

In addition the annular return lumen enhances the convective heat transfer coefficient within the heat transfer element especially adjacent an intermediate segment or bellows segment . Working fluid flowing through the annular return lumen between the outer surface of the bitumen member and the inner surface of the heat transfer element encounters a restriction caused by the impingement of the bellows section into the flow path. Although the impingement of the bellows section is shown as causing the restriction in the flow path of the return lumen in an alternative embodiment of the invention the bitumen member may create the restriction by being thicker in this longitudinal region of the bi lumen member . The distance between the bitumen member and the bellows section is such that the characteristic flow resulting from a flow of working fluid is at least of a transitional nature.

For a specific working fluid flux or flow rate cc sec the mean fluid velocity through the bellows section restriction will be greater than the mean fluid velocity obtained through the annular return lumen in the heat transfer segment of the heat transfer element . Sufficiently high velocity through the bellows section restriction will result in wall jets directed into the interior portion of the heat transfer segment . The wall jets enhance the heat transfer coefficient within the helical heat transfer segment because they enhance the mixing of the working fluid along the interior of the helical heat transfer segment . Increasing the velocity of the jets by increasing the working fluid flow rate or decreasing the size of the restriction will result in a transition closer to the jet exit and greater mean turbulence intensity throughout the helical heat transfer segment . Thus the outer surface of the bi lumen member adjacent the bellows and the inner surface of the bellows form means for further enhancing the transfer of heat between the heat transfer element and the working fluid in addition to that caused by the interior portion of the helical heat transfer segment .

In an alternative embodiment of the invention as described above the heat transfer element may include a number of heat transfer segments other than two i.e. 1 3 4 etc. with a corresponding number of intermediate segments i.e. the number of heat transfer segments minus one.

The embodiment of the multiple lumen arrangement discussed with respect to would not enhance the convective heat transfer coefficient as much as the embodiment of the multiple lumen arrangement discussed with respect to because working fluid would preferentially flow through the larger areas of the return lumen adjacent the junction of the first lumen member and second lumen member . Thus high speed working fluid would have more contact with the outer surface of the bitumen member and less contact with the interior portion of heat transfer element . In contrast the annular return lumen of the multiple lumen arrangement causes working fluid flow to be axisymmetric so that significant working fluid flow contacts all areas of the helical segment equally.

On the other hand the heat transfer element according to an embodiment of the present invention may also be made of a flexible material such as latex rubber. The latex rubber provides a high degree of flexibility which was previously achieved by articulation. The latex rubber further allows the heat transfer element to be made collapsible so that when deflated the same may be easily inserted into an artery. Insertion and location may be conveniently made by way of a guide catheter or guide wire. Following insertion and location in the desired artery the heat transfer element may be inflated for use by a working fluid such as saline water perfluorocarbons or other suitable fluids.

A heat transfer element made of a flexible material generally has significantly less thermal conductivity than a heat transfer element made of metal. The device compensates for this by enhancing the surface area available for heat transfer. This may be accomplished in two ways by increasing the cross sectional size and by increasing the length. Regarding the former the device may be structured to be large when inflated because when deflated the same may still be inserted into an artery. In fact the device may be as large as the arterial wall so long as a path for blood flow is allowed because the flexibility of the device tends to prevent damage to the arterial wall even upon contact. Such paths are described below. Regarding the latter the device may be configured to be long. One way to configure a long device is to taper the same so that the device may fit into distal arteries having reduced radii in a manner described below. The device further compensates for the reduced thermal conductivity by reducing the thickness of the heat transfer element wall.

Embodiments of the device use a heat transfer element design that produces a high level of turbulence in the free stream of the blood and in the working fluid. One embodiment of the invention forces a helical motion on the working fluid and imposes a helical barrier in the blood causing turbulence. In an alternative embodiment the helical barrier is tapered. In a second alternative embodiment a tapered inflatable heat transfer element has surface features to cause turbulence. As one example the surface features may have a spiral shape. In another example the surface features may be staggered protrusions. In all of these embodiments the design forces a high level of turbulence in the free stream of the blood by causing the blood to navigate a tortuous path while passing through the artery. This tortuous path causes the blood to undergo violent accelerations resulting in turbulence.

In a third alternative embodiment of the invention a taper of an inflatable heat transfer element provides enough additional surface area per se to cause sufficient heat transfer. In all of the embodiments the inflation is performed by the working fluid such as water or saline.

Referring to a side view is shown of a first embodiment of a heat transfer element according to an embodiment of the invention. The heat transfer element is formed by an inlet lumen and an outlet lumen . In this embodiment the outlet lumen is formed in a helix shape surrounding the inlet lumen that is formed in a pipe shape. The names of the lumens are of course not limiting. It will be clear to one skilled in the art that the inlet lumen may serve as an outlet and the outlet lumen may serve as an inlet. It will also be clear that the heat transfer element is capable of both heating by delivering heat to and cooling by removing heat from a desired area.

The heat transfer element is rigid but flexible so as to be insertable in an appropriate vessel by use of a guide catheter. Alternatively the heat transfer element may employ a device for threading a guide wire therethrough to assist placement within an artery. The heat transfer element has an inflated length of L a helical diameter of D a tubal diameter of d and a helical angle of . For example Dmay be about 3.3 mm and d may be about 0.9 mm to 1 mm. Of course the tubal diameter d need not be constant. For example the diameter of the inlet lumen may differ from that of the outlet lumen .

The shape of the outlet lumen in is helical. This helical shape presents a cylindrical obstacle in cross section to the flow of blood. Such obstacles tend to create turbulence in the free stream of blood. In particular the form of turbulence is the creation of von Karman vortices in the wake of the flow of blood downstream of the cylindrical obstacles.

Typical inflatable materials are not highly thermally conductive. They are much less conductive than the metallic heat transfer element disclosed in the patent application incorporated by reference above. The difference in conductivity is compensated for in at least two ways in the present device. The material is made thinner and the heat transfer element is afforded a larger surface area. Regarding the former the thickness may be less than about mil for adequate cooling.

Thin inflatable materials particularly those with large surface areas may require a structure such as a wire within their interiors to maintain their approximate uninflated positions so that upon inflation the proper form is achieved. Thus a wire structure is shown in which may be advantageously disposed within the inflatable material to perform such a function.

Another consideration is the angle of the helix. Angle should be determined to optimize the helical motion of the blood around the lumens and enhancing heat transfer. Of course angle should also be determined to optimize the helical motion of the working fluid within the lumens and . The helical motion of the working fluid within the lumens and increases the turbulence in the working fluid by creating secondary motions. In particular helical motion of a fluid in a pipe induces two counter rotating secondary flows.

An enhancement of would be obtained in this system and this enhancement may be described by a Nusselt number Nu of up to about 10 or even more.

The above discussion describes one embodiment of a heat transfer element. An alternative embodiment of the device shown in a side view in illustrates a heat transfer element with a surface area enhancement. Increasing the surface area of the inflatable material enhances heat transfer. The heat transfer element includes a series of coils or helices of different coil diameters and tubal diameters. It is not strictly necessary that the tubal diameters differ but it is likely that commercially realizable systems will have differing tubal diameters. The heat transfer element may taper either continuously or segmentally.

This alternative embodiment enhances surface area in two ways. First the use of smaller diameter lumens enhances the overall surface to volume ratio. Second the use of progressively smaller i.e. tapered lumens allows a distal end to be inserted further into an artery than would be possible with the embodiment of .

In the embodiment of a first coil segment is shown having length Land diameter D. The first coil segment is formed of an inlet lumen having diameter dand an outlet lumen having diameter d . In the first coil segment as well as the others the outlet lumen need not immediately drain the inlet lumen. In the inlet lumen for each segment feeds the inlet lumen of the succeeding segment except for an inlet lumen adjacent a distal end of the heat transfer element which directly feeds its corresponding outlet lumen.

A separate embodiment may also be constructed in which the inlet lumens each provide working fluid to their corresponding outlet lumens. In this embodiment either a separate lumen needs to be provided to drain each outlet lumen or each outlet lumen drains into the adjacent outlet lumen. This embodiment has the advantage that an opposite helicity may be accorded each successive segment. The opposite helicities in turn enhance the turbulence of the working fluid flowing past them.

A second coil segment is shown having length Land diameter D. The second coil segment is formed of an inlet lumen having diameter dand an outlet lumen having diameter d . A third coil segment is shown having length Land diameter D. The third coil segment is formed of an inlet lumen having diameter dand an outlet lumen having diameter d . Likewise a fourth coil segment is shown having length Land diameter D. The fourth coil segment is formed of an inlet lumen having diameter dand an outlet lumen having diameter d . The diameters of the lumens especially that of the lumen located at or near distal end should be large enough to not restrict the flow of the working fluid within them. Of course any number of lumens may be provided depending on the requirements of the user.

An advantage to this alternative embodiment arises from the smaller diameters of the distal segments. The heat transfer element of may be placed in smaller workspaces than the heat transfer element of . For example a treatment for brain trauma may include placement of a cooling device in the internal carotid artery of a patient. As noted above the common carotid artery feeds the internal carotid artery. In some patients the heat transfer element of may not fit in the internal carotid artery. Similarly the first coil segment of the heat transfer element in may not easily fit in the internal carotid artery although the second third and fourth segments may fit. Thus in the embodiment of the first coil segment may remain in the common carotid artery while the segments of smaller diameter the second third and fourth may be placed in the internal carotid artery. In fact in this embodiment Dmay be large such as 5 6 mm. The overall length of the heat transfer element may be e.g. about 20 to 25 cm. Of course such considerations play less of a role when the device is placed in a large vein such as the inferior vena cava.

An additional advantage was mentioned above. The surface area of the alternative embodiment of may be substantially larger than that of the embodiment of resulting in significantly enhanced heat transfer. For example the enhancement in surface area may be substantial such as up to or even more than three times compared to the surface area of the device of the application incorporated by reference above. An additional advantage of both embodiments is that the helical rounded shape allows atraumatic insertion into cylindrical cavities such as e.g. arteries.

Heat transfer element has a number of surface features disposed thereon. The surface features may be constructed with e.g. various hardening treatments applied to the heat transfer element or alternatively by injection molding. The hardening treatments may result in a wavy or corrugated surface to the exterior of heat transfer element . The hardening treatments may further result in a wavy or corrugated surface to the interior of heat transfer element . shows a variation of this embodiment in which a fabrication process is used which results in a spiral or helical shape to the surface features.

In another variation of this embodiment shown in a heat transfer element employs a plurality of protrusions on outlet lumen which surrounds an inlet lumen . In particular is a cut away perspective view of an alternative embodiment of a heat transfer element . A working fluid is circulated through an inlet lumen to a distal tip of the heat transfer element thereby inflating the heat transfer element . The working fluid then traverses an outlet coaxial lumen in order to transfer heat from the exterior surface of the heat transfer element . The inside structure of the heat transfer element is similar to the exterior structure in order to induce turbulent flow of the working fluid.

An external surface of the inflatable heat transfer element is covered with a series of staggered protrusions . The staggered nature of the protrusions is readily seen with reference to which is a transverse cross sectional view of an inflated heat transfer element taken along the line in . In order to induce free stream turbulence the height d of the staggered protrusions is greater than the thickness of the boundary layer which would develop if a smooth heat transfer element had been introduced into the blood stream. As the blood flows along the external surface it collides with one of the staggered protrusions and a turbulent flow is created. As the blood divides and swirls along side of the first staggered protrusion it collides with another staggered protrusion within its path preventing the re lamination of the flow and creating yet more turbulence. In this way the velocity vectors are randomized and free stream turbulence is created. As is the case with the other embodiments this geometry also induces a turbulent effect on the internal coolant flow.

Of course other surface features may also be used which result in turbulence in fluids flowing past them. These include spirals helices protrusions various polygonal bodies pyramids tetrahedrons wedges etc.

In some situations an enhanced surface area alone without the creation of additional turbulence may result in sufficient heat transfer to cool the blood. Referring to a heat transfer element is shown having an inlet lumen and an outlet lumen . The inlet lumen provides a working fluid to the heat transfer element and outlet lumen drains the working fluid from the same. The functions may of course be reversed. The heat transfer element is further divided into five segments although more or less may be provided as dictated by requirements of the user. The five segments in are denoted segments and . In the segment has a first and largest radius R followed by corresponding radii for segments and . Segment has a second and smallest radius. The length of the segment is L followed by corresponding lengths for segments and .

A purely tapered nonsegmented form may replace the tapered segmental form but the former may be more difficult to manufacture. In either case the tapered form allows the heat transfer element to be disposed in small arteries i.e. arteries with radii smaller than R. A sufficient surface area is thus afforded even in very small arteries to provide the required heat transfer.

The surface area and thus the size of the device should be substantial to provide the necessary heat transfer. Example dimensions for a three segmented tapered form may be as follows L 10 cm R 2.5 mm L 10 cm R 1.65 mm L 5 cm R 1 mm. Such a heat transfer element would have an overall length of 25 cm and a surface area of 3 10m.

The embodiment of results in an enhancement of the heat transfer rate of up to about 300 due to the increased surface area S alone.

A variation of the embodiment of includes placing at least one turbulence inducing surface feature within the interior of the outlet lumen . This surface feature may induce turbulence in the working fluid thereby increasing the convective heat transfer rate in the manner described above.

Another variation of the embodiment of involves reducing the joint diameter between segments not shown . For example the inflatable material may be formed such that joints and have a diameter only slightly greater than that of the inlet lumen . In other words the heat transfer element has a tapered sausage shape.

In all of the embodiments the inflatable material may be formed from seamless and nonporous materials which are therefore impermeable to gas. Impermeability can be particularly important depending on the type of working fluid which is cycled through the heat transfer element. For example the inflatable material may be latex or other such rubber materials or alternatively of any other material with similar properties under inflation. The flexible material allows the heat transfer element to bend extend and compress so that it is more readily able to navigate through tiny blood vessels. The material also provides for axial compression of the heat transfer element which can limit the trauma when the distal end of the heat transfer element abuts a blood vessel wall. The material should be chosen to tolerate temperatures in the range of 1 C. to 37 C. or even higher in the case of blood heating without a loss of performance.

It may be desirable to treat the surface of the heat transfer element to avoid clot formation because the heat transfer element may dwell within the blood vessel for extended periods of time such as 24 48 hours or even longer. One means by which to prevent thrombus formation is to bind an antithrombogenic agent to the surface of the heat transfer element. For example heparin is known to inhibit clot formation and is also known to be useful as a biocoating.

Referring back to an embodiment of the method of the invention will be described. A description with reference to the other embodiments is analogous. A guide catheter or wire may be disposed up to or near the area to be cooled or heated. The case of a guide catheter will be discussed here. The heat transfer element may be fed through the guide catheter to the area. Alternatively the heat transfer element may form a portion of the guide catheter. A portion of the interior of the guide catheter may form e.g. the return lumen for the working fluid. In any case the movement of the heat transfer element is made significantly more convenient by the flexibility of the heat transfer element as has been described above.

Once the heat transfer element is in place a working fluid such as saline or other aqueous solution may be circulated through the heat transfer element to inflate the same. Fluid flows from a supply catheter into the inlet lumen . At the distal end of the heat transfer element the working fluid exits the inlet lumen and enters the outlet lumen .

In the case of the embodiment of for which the description of is analogous the working fluid exits the inlet lumen and enters an outlet inflatable lumen having segments and . As the working fluid flows through the outlet lumen heat is transferred from the exterior surface of the heat transfer element to the working fluid. The temperature of the external surface may reach very close to the temperature of the working fluid because the heat transfer element is constructed from very thin material.

The working fluids that may be employed in the device include water saline or other fluids which remain liquid at the temperatures used. Other coolants such as freon undergo nucleated boiling and may create turbulence through a different mechanism. Saline is a safe coolant because it is non toxic and leakage of saline does not result in a gas embolism which may occur with the use of boiling refrigerants.

By enhancing turbulence in the coolant the coolant can be delivered to the heat transfer element at a warmer temperature and still achieve the necessary heat transfer rate. In particular the enhanced heat transfer characteristics of the internal structure allow the working fluid to be delivered to the heat transfer element at lower flow rates and lower pressures. This is advantageous because high pressures may stiffen the heat transfer element and cause the same to push against the wall of the vessel thereby shielding part of the heat transfer unit from the blood. Such pressures are unlikely to damage the walls of the vessel because of the increased flexibility of the inflated device. The increased heat transfer characteristics allow the pressure of the working fluid to be delivered at pressures as low as 5 atmospheres 3 atmospheres 2 atmospheres or even less than 1 atmosphere.

In a preferred embodiment the heat transfer element creates a turbulence intensity greater than 0.05 in order to create the desired level of turbulence in the entire blood stream during the whole cardiac cycle. The turbulence intensity may be greater than 0.055 0.06 0.07 or up to 0.10 or 0.20 or even greater.

As shown in in another embodiment of the invention the cooling apparatus of the present invention includes a flexible multilumen catheter an inflatable balloon and a plurality of blood flow passageways through the balloon . The balloon is shown in an inflated state in a selected position in a common carotid artery CC.

The balloon is attached near a distal end of the flexible catheter . The catheter can have at least a cooling fluid supply lumen and a cooling fluid return lumen with the cooling fluid supply lumen preferably being located substantially within the cooling fluid return lumen . The catheter can also have a guidewire lumen for the passage of a guidewire as is known in the art.

The balloon can be formed from a flexible material such as a polymer. The balloon can be constructed to assume a substantially cylindrical shape when inflated with a proximal aspect and a distal aspect . The balloon can have a plurality of tubular shaped blood flow passageways formed therethrough from the proximal aspect to the distal aspect . The tubular walls of the passageways constitute a heat transfer surface for transferring heat from the blood to the cooling fluid. The flexible material of the tubular passageways can be at least in part a metallized material such as a film coated with a thin metal layer either internally externally or both to aid in heat transfer through the passageway walls. Alternatively the tubular passageways can be constructed of a metal loaded polymer film. Further the remainder of the balloon can be coated with a thin metallized layer either internally externally or both or a metal loaded polymer film. The proximal aspect and the distal aspect of the balloon can also constitute a heat transfer surface for transferring heat from the blood to the cooling fluid. The guidewire lumen of the catheter can also pass through the balloon from the proximal aspect to the distal aspect .

As shown in each tubular passageway has a proximal port in a proximal face on the proximal aspect of the balloon and a distal port in a distal face on the distal aspect of the balloon . A cooling fluid supply port near the distal end of the cooling fluid supply lumen supplies chilled saline solution from a chiller not shown to the interior of the balloon surrounding the blood flow passageways . A cooling fluid return port in the cooling fluid return lumen returns the saline solution from the interior of the balloon to the chiller. Relative placement of the cooling fluid ports can be chosen to establish flow counter to the direction of blood flow if desired.

In practice the balloon in a deflated state is passed through the vascular system of a patient on the distal end of the catheter over the guidewire . Placement of the guidewire and the balloon can be monitored fluoroscopically as is known in the art by use of radiopaque markers not shown on the guidewire and the balloon . When the balloon has been positioned at a desired location in the feeding artery of a selected organ such as in the common carotid artery feeding the brain fluid such as saline solution is supplied through the cooling fluid supply lumen . This fluid passes through the cooling fluid supply port into the interior of the balloon surrounding the tubular passageways to inflate the balloon . Although the balloon can be formed to assume a substantially cylindrical shape upon unconstrained inflation the balloon will essentially conform to the shape of the artery within which it is inflated. As the balloon inflates the blood flow passageways open substantially assuming the tubular shape shown.

When the balloon has been properly inflated blood continues to flow through the feeding artery CC by flowing through the blood flow passageways as indicated for example by the arrows in . The size and number of the blood flow passageways are designed to provide a desired amount of heat transfer surface while maintaining a suitable amount of blood flow through the feeding artery CC. Return flow to the chiller can be established to allow flow of cooling fluid through the cooling fluid return port and the cooling fluid return lumen to the chiller. This establishes a continuous flow of cooling fluid through the interior of the balloon around the blood flow passageways . The return flow is regulated to maintain the balloon in its inflated state while circulation of cooling fluid takes place. The saline solution is cooled in the chiller to maintain a desired cooling fluid temperature in the interior of the balloon to impart a desired temperature drop to the blood flowing through the tubular passageways . This cooled blood flows through the feeding artery to impart the desired amount of cooling to the selected organ. Then cooling fluid can be evacuated or released from the balloon through the catheter to deflate the balloon and the apparatus can be withdrawn from the vascular system of the patient.

A guidewire may also be employed to assist in installing the device. The tip of the guidewire may contain or be part of a temperature monitor. The temperature monitor may be employed to measure the temperature upstream or downstream of the heat transfer element and catheter depending on the direction of blood flow relative to the temperature monitor. The temperature monitor may be e.g. a thermocouple or thermistor.

An embodiment of the invention may employ a thermocouple which is mounted on the end of the guidewire. For the temperatures considered in blood heating or cooling most of the major thermocouple types may be used including Types T E J K G C D R S B.

In an alternative embodiment a thermistor may be used which is attached to the end of the guidewire. Thermistors are thermally sensitive resistors whose resistance changes with a change in body temperature. The use of thermistors may be particularly advantageous for use in temperature monitoring of blood flow past cooling devices because of their sensitivity. For temperature monitoring of body fluids thermistors that are mostly commonly used include those with a large negative temperature coefficient of resistance NTC . These should ideally have a working temperature range inclusive of 25 C. to 40 C. Potential thermistors that may be employed include those with active elements of polymers or ceramics. Ceramic thermistors may be most preferable as these may have the most reproducible temperature measurements. Most thermistors of appropriate sizes are encapsulated in protective materials such as glass. The size of the thermistor for convenient mounting to the guidewire and for convenient insertion in a patient s vasculature may be about or less than 15 mils. Larger thermistors may be used where desired. Of course various other temperature monitoring devices may also be used as dictated by the size geometry and temperature resolution desired.

A signal from the temperature monitoring device may be fed back to the source of working fluid to control the temperature of the working fluid emerging therefrom. In particular a catheter may be connected to a source of working fluid. A proximal end of a supply lumen defined by a supply tube is connected at an output port to the source of working fluid. The return lumen defined by a return tube is similarly connected at an input port to the source of working fluid. The source of working fluid can control the temperature of the working fluid emerging from the output port. A signal from a circuit may be inputted to the source of working fluid at an input. The signal from the circuit may be from the thermocouple or may alternatively be from any other type of temperature monitoring device such as at the tip of the guidewire.

The signal may advantageously be employed to alter the temperature if necessary of the working fluid from the source. For example if the temperature monitoring device senses that the temperature of the blood flowing in the feeding vessel of the patient s vasculature is below optimal a signal may be sent to the source of working fluid to increase the temperature of the working fluid emerging therefrom. The opposite may be performed if the temperature monitoring device senses that the temperature of the blood flowing in the feeding vessel of the patient s vasculature is above optimal.

The method of inserting the catheter into the patient and routing the cooling element into a selected vein is well known in the art. Percutaneous placement of the heat transfer element into the jugular vein is accomplished directly since the jugular vein is close to the surface. The catheter would reside in the internal jugular and into the superior vena cava or even the right atrium.

Although the working fluid supply is shown as an exemplary cooling device other devices and working fluids may be used. For example in order to provide cooling freon perfluorocarbon water or saline may be used as well as other such coolants.

The cooling element can absorb up to or more than 300 Watts of heat from the blood stream resulting in absorption of as much as 100 Watts 150 Watts 170 Watts or more from the brain.

The heating blanket serves several purposes. By warming the patient vasoconstriction is avoided. The patient is also made more comfortable. For example it is commonly agreed that for every one degree of core body temperature reduction the patient will continue to feel comfortable if the same experiences a rise in surface area skin temperature of five degrees. Spasms due to total body hypothermia may be avoided. Temperature control of the patient may be more conveniently performed as the physician has another variable the amount of heating which may be adjusted.

As an alternative the warming element may be any of the heating methods proposed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09 292 532 filed on Apr. 15 1999 and entitled Isolated Selective Organ Cooling Method and Apparatus and incorporated by reference above.

Referring now to is a schematic representation of an embodiment of the invention is shown in a selective cooling version being used to cool the brain of a patient and to warm the blood returning from the brain in the jugular vein. The selective organ hypothermia apparatus shown in includes a first working fluid supply preferably supplying a chilled liquid such as water alcohol or a halogenated hydrocarbon a first supply catheter and the cooling element . The first supply catheter has a coaxial construction. An inner coaxial lumen within the first supply catheter receives coolant from the first working fluid supply . The coolant travels the length of the first supply catheter to the cooling element which serves as the cooling tip of the catheter. At the distal end of the cooling element the coolant exits the insulated interior lumen and traverses the length of the cooling element in order to decrease the temperature of the cooling element . The coolant then traverses an outer lumen of the first supply catheter so that it may be disposed of or recirculated. The first supply catheter is a flexible catheter having a diameter sufficiently small to allow its distal end to be inserted percutaneously into an accessible artery such as the femoral artery of a patient as shown in . The first supply catheter is sufficiently long to allow the cooling element at the distal end of the first supply catheter to be passed through the vascular system of the patient and placed in the internal carotid artery or other small artery. The method of inserting the catheter into the patient and routing the cooling element into a selected artery is well known in the art.

Although the working fluid supply is shown as an exemplary cooling device other devices and working fluids may be used. For example in order to provide cooling freon perfluorocarbon water or saline may be used as well as other such coolants.

The cooling element can absorb or provide over 75 Watts of heat to the blood stream and may absorb or provide as much as 100 Watts 150 Watts 170 Watts or more. For example a cooling element with a diameter of 4 mm and a length of approximately 10 cm using ordinary saline solution chilled so that the surface temperature of the heat transfer element is approximately 5 C. and pressurized at 2 atmospheres can absorb about 100 Watts of energy from the bloodstream. Smaller geometry heat transfer elements may be developed for use with smaller organs which provide 60 Watts 50 Watts 25 Watts or less of heat transfer.

As an alternative the warming element can be an electrical resistance heater controlled by a controller represented by item .

Percutaneous placement of the warming element into the jugular vein is accomplished directly since the jugular vein is close to the surface. The catheter would reside in the internal jugular and into the superior vena cava or even the right atrium. Jugular venous catheters are known. As an alternative to warming of the blood in the jugular vein with a warming element a warm saline solution can be infused into the jugular vein from a saline supply via an intravenous catheter as shown in . This is advantageous since saline drips are often necessary anyway as maintenance fluids 1000 to 2500 cc day . As yet another alternative warming can be applied externally to the patient. The means of warming can be a heating blanket applied to the whole body or localized heating of veins returning from the organ being cooled. As an example shows a neck brace being used to immobilize the head of the patient. Immobilization of the head can be necessary to prevent movement of the cooling element or to prevent puncture of the feeding artery by the cooling element. The neck brace can have one or more warming elements placed directly over the left and right internal jugular veins to heat the blood flowing in the jugular veins through the skin. The warming elements can be warmed by circulating fluid or they can be electrical resistance heaters. Temperature control can be maintained by a working fluid supply or controller .

2. The procedure may be carried out in an angiography suite or surgical suite equipped with fluoroscopy.

3. An ultrasound or angiogram of the superior vena cava and external jugular can be used to determine the vessel diameter and the blood flow a catheter with an appropriately sized heat transfer element can be selected.

5. After assessment of the veins the patient is sterilely prepped and infiltrated with lidocaine at a region where the femoral artery may be accessed.

6. The external jugular is cannulated and a guide wire may be inserted to the superior vena cava. Placement of the guide wire is confirmed with fluoroscopy.

7. An angiographic catheter can be fed over the wire and contrast media injected into the vein to further to assess the anatomy if desired.

8. Alternatively the external jugular is cannulated and a 10 12.5 french f introducer sheath is placed.

9. A guide catheter is placed into the superior vena cava. If a guide catheter is placed it can be used to deliver contrast media directly to further assess anatomy.

10. The cooling catheter is placed into the superior vena cava via the guiding catheter or over the guidewire.

12. Alternatively the cooling catheter shaft has sufficient pushability and torqueability to be placed in the superior vena cava without the aid of a guide wire or guide catheter.

13. The cooling catheter is connected to a pump circuit also filled with saline and free from air bubbles. The pump circuit has a heat exchange section that is immersed into a water bath and tubing that is connected to a peristaltic pump. The water bath is chilled to approximately 0 C. 14. Cooling is initiated by starting the pump mechanism. The saline within the cooling catheter is circulated at 5 cc sec. The saline travels through the heat exchanger in the chilled water bath and is cooled to approximately 1 C. 15. The saline subsequently enters the cooling catheter where it is delivered to the heat transfer element. The saline is warmed to approximately 5 7 C. as it travels along the inner lumen of the catheter shaft to the end of the heat transfer element. 16. The saline then flows back through the heat transfer element in contact with the inner metallic surface. The saline is further warmed in the heat transfer element to 12 15 C. and in the process heat is absorbed from the blood cooling the blood to 30 C. to 35 C. During this time the patient may be warmed with an external heat source such as a heating blanket. 17. The chilled blood then goes on to chill the body. It is estimated that less than an hour will be required to cool the brain to 30 C. to 35 C. 18. The warmed saline travels back the outer lumen of the catheter shaft and is returned to the chilled water bath where the same is cooled to 1 C. 19. The pressure drops along the length of the circuit are estimated to be between 1 and 10 atmospheres. 20. The cooling can be adjusted by increasing or decreasing the flow rate of the saline. Monitoring of the temperature drop of the saline along the heat transfer element will allow the flow to be adjusted to maintain the desired cooling effect. 21. The catheter is left in place to provide cooling for e.g. 6 48 hours.

In another method of use and referring to an alternative embodiment is shown in which the heat transfer element is disposed in the superior vena cava from the axillary vein rather than from the external jugular. It is envisioned that the following veins may be appropriate to percutaneously insert the heat transfer element femoral internal jugular subclavian and other veins of similar size and position. It is also envisioned that the following veins may be appropriate in which to dispose the heat transfer element during use inferior vena cava superior vena cava femoral internal jugular and other veins of similar size and position.

The above description discloses mechanical methods of rewarming a patient or portions of a patient to minimize the deleterious consequences of total body hypothermia. Another procedure which may be performed either contemporaneous with or in place of mechanical warming is the administration of anti vasoconstriction and anti shivering drugs. Such drugs minimize the effect of vasoconstriction which may otherwise hinder heat transfer and thus cooling of the patient. In general hypothermia tends to trigger aggressive thermoregulatory defenses in the human body. Such drugs also prohibit responses such as shivering which may cause damage to cardiac compromised patients by increasing their metabolic rate to dangerous levels.

To limit the effectiveness of thermoregulatory defenses during therapeutic hypothermia drugs that induce thermoregulatory tolerance may be employed. A variety of these drugs have been discovered. For example clonidine meperidine a combination of clonidine and meperidine propofol magnesium dexmedetomidine and other such drugs may be employed.

It is known that certain drugs inhibit thermoregulation roughly in proportion to their anesthetic properties. Thus volatile anesthetics isoflurane desflurane etc. propofol etc. are more effective at inhibiting thermoregulation than opioids which are in turn more effective than midazolam and the central alpha agonists. It is believed that the combination drug of clonidine and meperidine synergistically reduces vasoconstriction and shivering thresholds synergistically reduces the gain and maximum intensity of vasoconstriction and shivering and produces sufficient inhibition of thermoregulatory activity to permit central catheter based cooling to 32 C. without excessive hypotension autonomic nervous system activation or sedation and respiratory compromise.

These drugs may be particularly important given the rapid onset of thermoregulatory defenses. For example vasoconstriction may set in at temperatures of only degree below normal body temperature. Shivering sets in only a fraction of a degree below vasoconstriction.

The temperature to which the blood is lowered may be such that thermoregulatory responses are not triggered. For example thermoregulatory responses may be triggered at a temperature of 1 degrees below normal temperature. Thus if normal body temperature is 37 C. thermoregulatory responses may set in at 35 C. Thermoregulatory drugs may be used to lower the temperature of the thermoregulatory trigger threshold to 33 C. Use of the heating blankets described above may allow even further cooling of the patient. For example to lower the patient s temperature from 33 C. to 31 C. a 2 C. temperature difference a 2 times 5 C. or 10 C. rise is surface temperature may be employed on the skin of the patient to allow the patient to not feel the extra 2 C. cooling.

A method which combines the thermoregulatory drug methodology and the heating blanket methodology is described with respect to . This figure is purely exemplary. Patients normal body temperatures vary as do their thermoregulatory thresholds.

As shown in the patient may start with a normal body temperature of 37 C. and a typical thermoregulatory threshold of 35 C. step . In other words at 35 C. the patient would begin to shiver and vasoconstrict. A thermoregulatory drug may be delivered step to suppress the thermoregulatory response changing the threshold temperature to e.g. 35 C. This new value is shown in step . The heat transfer element may then be placed in a high flow vein such as the superior or inferior vena cavae or both step . Cooling may occur to lower the temperature of the blood step . The cooling may be in a fashion described in more detail above. The cooling results in the patient undergoing hypothermia and achieving a hypothermic temperature of e.g. 33 C. step . More cooling may be performed at this stage but as the thermoregulatory threshold has only been suppressed to 33 C. step shivering and vasoconstriction would deleteriously result. This may complete the procedure. Alternatively an additional drug therapy may be delivered to further lower the thermoregulatory threshold.

An alternate way to lower the thermoregulatory threshold is to use a heating blanket. As noted above a common rule of thumb is that a patient s comfort will stay constant even if their body temperature is lowered 1 C. so long as a heating blanket 5 C. warmer than their skin is applied to a substantial portion of the surface area of the patient step . For a 2 C. body temperature reduction a 10 C. warmer than the skin temperature blanket would be applied. Of course it is also known that blankets warmer than about 42 C. can damage patient s skins this then being an upper limit to the blanket temperature. The patient s body temperature may then continue to be lowered by use of a heating blanket. For each 1 C. reduction in body temperature step the heating blanket temperature may be raised 5 C. step . After each reduction in body temperature the physician may decide whether or not to continue the cooling process step . After cooling other procedures may be performed if desired step and the patient may then be rewarmed step .

It is important to note that the two alternate methods of thermoregulatory response reduction may be performed independently. In other words either thermoregulatory drugs or heating blankets may be performed without the use of the other. The flowchart given in may be used by omitting either step or steps and .

An alternate method of performing the same function is to provide separate vasoconstrictive drugs which affect the posterior hypothalamus in such a way as to vasoconstrict the peripheral circulation while allowing heart and brain circulation to proceed unimpeded. Such drugs are known and include alpha receptor type drugs. These drugs as well as the cooling blankets described above may also enhance counter current exchange again forcing cooling towards the heart and brain. Generally any drug or cooling blanket that provides sufficient cooling to initiate a large scale cutaneous peripheral vasoconstrictive response would be capable of forcing the cooling blood flow towards the brain and heart i.e. the central volumes . In this application the term peripheral circulation or peripheral vasculature refers to that portion of the vasculature serving the legs arms muscles and skin.

Other thermoregulatory drugs are now described. Meperidine is an analgesic of the phenyl piperidine class that is known to bind to the opiate receptor. Meperidine is also used to treat shivering due to post operative anesthesia and hypothermia. Meperidine can also treat rigors associated with the administration of amphotericin B.

Meperidine can also be used to control shivering when hypothermia is induced clinically. During periods of ischemia such as occurs during a stroke or heart attack hypothermia can protect the tissue from damage. It is important to be able to cool patients with out inducing a general anesthetic condition requiring intubation. To cool conscious patients requires very high doses of meperidine. Cooling of patients can be accomplished by the above noted methods such as cooling blankets air or water or alcohol bathing. Cooling can also be accomplished by body cavity lavage bladder stomach colon peritoneal . The most efficient way to cool patients as noted above for therapeutic purposes is using an intravascular catheter. An intravascular cooling catheter has a heat exchange region that is responsible for exchanging heat with the blood. Absorption of heat from the blood by the heat exchange region results in cooling of the body. Causing mixing or turbulence on or near the heat exchange region enhances heat transfer by intravascular methods. The heat exchanger of the intravascular catheter can have features that induce turbulence or mixing.

Shivering is regulated by the hypothalamus of the brain. The hypothalamus regulates body temperature in general by controlling heat production and heat loss. Heat production above the base metabolic level is produced through shivering while heat loss is prevented by vasoconstriction which decreases blood flow to the skin periphery. The normothermic set point of the hypothalamus is approximately 37 C. When the body is cooled a threshold is reached at which vasoconstriction and shivering occur. Vasoconstriction occurs approximately 0.5 1.0 C. below the set point with shivering occurring 1.0 1.5 C. below the set point. The intensity of shivering increases proportionally with the difference from the threshold up to a maximum intensity. Meperidine lowers the threshold at which shivering occurs but it does not have much effect on the gain and maximum intensity. The reduction of the shivering threshold is proportional to the serum concentration of meperidine such that greater serum concentrations cause a greater reduction in the threshold. Meperidine is believed to possess special antishivering effects in particular because it decreases the shivering threshold twice as much as the vasoconstriction threshold. In addition it prevents or manages shivering better than equianalgesic doses of other opioids.

Meperidine s antishivering effects lowering of the shivering threshold may not be related to binding of the opiate receptor. Meperidine is known to have numerous non opioid effects such as anticholinergic action and local anesthetic properties. Further the antishivering effects produced by meperidine are not antagonized by nalaxone an opiate receptor antagonist. In addition other opiates such as morphine pentazocine and nalbuphine have less or no antishivering activity. Referring now to the meperidine molecule is structurally very different from the morphine in or morphine derivatives which may help explain the different effects.

Meperidine usage has a number of undesirable side effects and many are related to the affinity for the opiate receptor. The most serious is respiratory sedation which can result in death and may be related to affinity for the delta opiate receptor. It has been shown that blocking the delta opiate receptor with an antagonist can reduce or eliminate opioid induced respiratory sedation. In addition meperidine is metabolized in the liver by n demethylation which produces the metabolite nor meperidine. Nor meperidine is known to have central nervous system toxicity and can cause seizures. Meperidine cannot be used in patients with renal insufficiency or kidney failure due to a rapid build up of the normeperidine metabolite. In addition meperidine cannot be used in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors due to complications such as convulsions and hyperpyrexia.

Prodines alpha and beta see molecules and are structurally very similar to meperidine. They too bind to the opiate receptor though with greater affinity. Unlike meperidine prodines have chirality. Chiral molecules have at least one asymmetric atomic center that causes the mirror image of the base molecule to be non superimposable on base molecule. Each species the base molecule and the mirror image is referred to as an enantiomer.

Chiral molecules are optically active meaning each enantiomer can rotate a plane of polarized light equal but opposite directions clockwise and counter clockwise plus and minus. Thus if one enantiomer rotates a plane of polarized light 10 degrees enantiomer the opposite enantiomer will rotate light 10 degrees enantiomer . For example the two prodines known as alpha and beta differ in the position of the 3 methyl group. A chiral atomic center exists at the carbon to which the 3 methyl group is bound and results in the various enantiomeric species. The chemical reactions that produce chiral molecules often produce racemic mixtures or mixtures that contain fractions of each enantiomer. A racemic mixture that contains equal proportions of each enantiomer is optically inactive.

Binding to the opiate receptor is known to be stereoselective. This means that one enantiomer has much greater affinity for the receptor than the other enantiomer. For example the isomer of morphine has much greater affinity for the opiate receptor than the isomer. In the case of alpha and beta prodine the isomer has much greater affinity for the receptor than the isomer.

It is reasonable to assume that the prodines have anti shiver effects similar to meperidine due to their structural similarity. This is a reasonable assumption because fentanyl molecule of an opioid analgesic that is also structurally related to meperidine also has anti shiver effects. Fentanyl also has opiate related side effects such as respiratory sedation.

The ideal antishiver medication or regimen would have potent antishiver efficacy with little respiratory sedation or other side effects. One way to accomplish is to use meperidine fentanyl or other opioids with antishiver effects in combination with a delta opiate receptor antagonist. Naltrindole or naltriben are competitive antagonists at the delta receptor and can block the respiratory sedation caused by fentanyl. Thus inducing hypothermia in a conscious patient using an intravascular cooling catheter would be accomplished using a drug regimen that included an opiate such as fentanyl or meperidine in combination with a delta receptor antagonist such as naltrindole.

A molecule structurally similar to meperidine but unable to bind to the opiate receptor or having antagonism at the opiate receptor would likely possess anti shiver effects but not opiate related respiratory sedation since anti shivering effects may be mediated through a different receptor. This ideal anti shiver molecule exists in the form of the isomer of alpha or beta prodine. The ratio of opiate efficacy between the enantiomeric forms of alpha and beta prodine is at least 10 to 30 fold. Because of the structural similarity to meperidine they would likely retain the antishiver efficacy. In an analogous example dextromethorphan is a morphine based chemical that is a cough suppressant antitussive . Dextromethorphan which is the methoxy enantiomer of levorphanol has retained the antitussive effects of morphine derivatives i.e. levorphanol but lost other opiate effects such as analgesia respiratory sedation and addiction.

In addition the opiate receptor affinity of the isomer of alpha and beta prodine could also be interrupted. This can be accomplished by adding a hydroxyl particularly in the m position to phenyl ring. This is particularly true of the potent opiate analgesic alpha allylprodine in which the 3 methyl is replaced with an allyl group see molecule of . Further the opiate activity of betaprodine isomer can be significantly diminished by the substitution of the 3 methyl group with an n propyl or allyl group. These modifications to the isomers of the prodine molecules that inhibit opiate activity will not likely effect antishiver activity due to the structural similarity to meperidine.

Cis Picenadol 1 3 dimethyl 4 propyl 4 hydroxyphenyl piperidine cis 3 methyl 4 propyl is phenyl piperidine compound in which the enantiomer has antagonist properties at the opiate receptor see molecules and of . Due to the structural similarity to meperidine this enantiomer may have anti shiver activity with little respiratory sedation. It is known that the racemic mixture of this opioid has a ceiling effect with respect to respiratory sedation when used in animals. This ceiling effect may make racemic picenadol a better anti shiver drug than meperidine. Finally tramadol molecule of may have an enantiomer that has reduced opiate activity that could lower the shiver threshold.

Alpha prodine has been used as an analgesic in clinical medicine marketed under the trade name Nisentil. The drug is supplied as a racemic mixture. It is possible to separate the racemic mixture into two pure isomers and use the isomer as an antishiver medication. Such a separation can be accomplished using high performance liquid chromatography HPLC using a chiral stationary phase. One such chiral stationary phase is cellulose based and is supplied as Chiralcel OD and Chiralcel OJ.

A representative example of the use of the novel antishiver or threshold lowering drugs or regimen is a clinical procedure to induce hypothermia in a patient. The patient would first be diagnosed with an ischemic injury such as a stroke or heart attack. An intravascular cooling catheter or a cooling blanket would be applied to the patient. The patient would be given an intravenous injection of the novel anti shiver drug such as alpha prodine. Alternatively the patient could be given meperidine or fentanyl in combination with a delta opiate receptor antagonist. Buspirone could be given in combination with either of the above regimens because it is know to enhance the antishiver effects of meperidine. The patient would be cooled to 32 35 C. or lower. During the maintenance of cooling which could last 1248 hours or longer doses of the antishiver drug or regimen would begin to maintain a certain plasma concentration. An infusion of the novel antishiver drug could be used to maintain the plasma concentration. When the cooling was complete the patient would be rewarmed and the drugs discontinued.

Another ideal antishiver drug may be nefopam molecule of . Nefopam is widely used as an analgesic particularly outside the U.S. While it is not an analog of meperidine it has similar structural and conformational properties. For example it has a phenyl group attached to a N methyl ring and the phenyl group prefers the equatorial position. Similar to meperidine nefopam is known to prevent post operative shivering and to prevent shivering related to Amphotericin B administration. However nefopam has less respiratory depression side effects and is not metabolized into a neurotoxic compound. Injectable nefopam is a racemic mixture. Analgesic activity resides in the enantiomer. The enantiomer may be a selective anti shiver drug and superior to the racemic form. Combining nefopam with intravascular catheter based cooling induction may allow for successful implementation of therapeutic hypothermia.

It may also be desirable to use combinations of the compounds listed above or combine them with other drugs that can reduce shivering and lower the threshold. This may lower the doses needed for either drug and reduce side effects. For example one could combine nefopam with alpha prodine meperidine thorazine buspirone clonidine tramadol or other medications to achieve the desired effect. The same combinations could be used with alpha prodine. There are many other combinations that could be tried including combining three agents together. These combinations can be used with endovascular or surface hypothermia induction for therapeutic purposes.

The above devices and techniques including those disclosed in the applications incorporated by reference above provide effective cooling or heating of a fluid such as blood. The heating or cooling may occur either in the affected vessel or in a vessel in fluid communication with the affected vessel. In this disclosure as noted above fluid communication between two vessels refers to a situation where one vessel either feeds or is fed by the other. One application of these devices and techniques is for clot lysis. However other types of enzyme activations may also be advantageously induced. The method disclosed below is applicable to other devices and techniques so long as they are also capable of heating or cooling blood.

As noted above enzymes have been delivered to patients in drug or intravenous form for clot lysing. These enzymes are in addition to naturally occurring enzymes already in the blood plasma. The activity of enzymes is at least partially adjusted by control of environmental temperature. A method according to an embodiment of the invention selectively controls enzyme activity by controlling the temperature of the environment of the enzyme. This controlled enzyme activity allows selective thrombolysis by selective vessel hypothermia in a manner described in more detail below.

Several experimental procedures have been reported on animals and clot preparations at various temperatures as disclosed below and appropriate temperature regimes for thrombolysis may be inferred with some accuracy. However the mechanisms by which enzyme environmental temperature controls thrombolysis are not yet well characterized. Disclosed below are several suggested mechanisms. These suggested mechanisms are conjecture and should not be construed as limiting in any way the method of the invention.

The suggested mechanisms rely to a certain extent on the known mechanisms for fibrinolysis. In particular plasminogen is the inert precursor of plasmin. Plasmin is an enzyme that lyses clots i.e. cleaves peptide bonds in fibrin. Plasminogen binds to fibrin and when activated by an appropriate enzyme such as tPA UK SK etc. converts to plasmin. Plasminogen may also be activated in solution. Inhibitors such as antiplasmin moderate plasmin activity by inactivating plasmin released from a fibrin surface almost instantaneously. antiplasmin can even inactivate plasmin bound to a fibrin surface but this process requires about 10 seconds.

One suggested mechanism concerns the action of the inhibitors. The activity of antiplasmin is lessened at low temperatures and thus is less effective at inactivating plasmin. In this case more plasmin is available to lyse clots and thus fibrinolysis is enhanced.

A related effect is due to the effect of plasmin levels on plasminogen levels. Increased plasmin levels may lead to increased plasminogen levels circulating in solution. Moreover decreased activity of antiplasmin also leads to increased plasminogen levels because antiplasmin binds plasminogen and less antiplasmin means less of such binding.

For example plasmin cleaves single chain urokinase scu PA or pro UK to form UK i.e. pro UK is a precursor to UK. Pro UK like tPA cannot efficiently activate plasminogen in solution but it can readily activate plasminogen bound to fibrin. Thus increased plasminogen together with the body s own UK or tPA or similar enzymes provided intravenously may result in more localized lysing of fibrin e.g. directly at the clot situs.

Another suggested mechanism results from increased plasminogen. UK can activate both plasminogen in solution and plasminogen bound to fibrin. Thus increased plasminogen levels together with the body s own UK or that provided intravenously results in both localized lysing of fibrin and enhanced activation of plasminogen in solution.

Another suggested mechanism results from the conjectured bond of plasmin in to fibrin. Plasmin may stay bound to fibrin for a longer period in the hypothermic state. Thus more time may be available to lyse clots increasing overall fibrinolysis.

The hypothermic temperatures at which increased fibrinolysis occurs have not been fully explored. However it has been shown that clot samples have benefited from temperatures of e.g. 25 C. or below. For human patients it is believed that temperatures of 30 C. to 32 C. may well be appropriate and advantageously employed in the method of the invention.

In a related embodiment of the invention the method may further employ a step of rewarming the cooled organ from the low temperature of e.g. 30 C. The temperature range for rewarming may be from about 20 C. to 37 C. depending on the patient the condition the hypothermic temperature and so on. Rewarming has been shown to have a beneficial effect in certain studies perhaps by increasing the rate at which clot lysis occurs. In another related embodiment of the invention the method may further employ temperature cycling the blood in the vessel from a hypothermic temperature to a rewarmed temperature. In this way the rewarming temperature regime is achieved repeatedly and thus so is the enhanced fibrinolysis.

Researchers have studied the effect of temperature on fibrinolysis in the context of drug studies. As part of these studies control groups are investigated in which no drugs are introduced. In one such investigation using clot samples clot lysis was investigated while varying clot temperatures in a range of 25 C. to 41 C. In the absence of drugs enhanced clot lysis was seen at the lower part of the temperature range. It is believed that this study can be extended to humans and thus fibrinolytic activity can be enhanced at lower temperatures.

In another non drug study of the effect of temperature on fibrinolysis clot lysis in dogs was investigated while varying clot temperatures in a range of 20 C. to 36 C. The dog s temperature was lowered from a normal temperature to a low temperature. A gradual rewarming period followed the low temperature period.

Enhanced clot lysis was observed at lower temperatures as compared to higher temperatures. In particular the maximum fibrinolytic activity occurred in the early rewarming period i.e. from 20 C. to about 25 C. It is believed that this study can be extended to humans and that fibrinolytic activity can be enhanced at lower temperatures especially during periods of rewarming.

An advantage of all of these embodiments of the method is that clot lysis can be achieved in a simple manner and without the need for drugs. An additional advantage results from the reduced temperature of the blood which helps to protect the cells from ischemia at the same time lysis is occurring. Thus clot lysis and cooling occur simultaneously providing an effective and aggressive dual therapy. When dual therapies are employed cooling catheters may be inserted in both femoral arteries for transit to the brain. One cooling catheter cools the brain while the other cools the blood in the artery leading to the clot. The latter provides the beneficial effects noted above.

In some cases of course the nature or extent of the clot is such that lysing may only occur with drug intervention. In these cases thrombolytic drugs such as those disclosed above may be introduced to induce the fibrinolysis.

These drugs are effective at treating the thrombus. However it may also be advantageous to cool the brain as a separate neuroprotective measure. The effectiveness of both therapies is enhanced when applied as soon as possible. Thus it is often desirable to apply both therapies simultaneously. In this way hypothermia is induced as a neuroprotective measure and may further induce clot lysing per se in the manner described above.

A difficulty with this approach is that the techniques are interdependent. Drugs depend on enzymes for their activity and enzymes are temperature dependent. In fact past studies have demonstrated that the enzyme activity of these specific thrombolytic drugs on clot samples is temperature dependent. In other words their effect on clot or thrombus lysis varies over a temperature range. For typical temperature specific enzymes the greatest activity occurs at an optimal temperature. The optimal temperature may be about 37 C. in the case of known thrombolytics as this is the normal human body temperature.

Enzyme activity drastically reduces above certain temperatures as the enzyme denatures and becomes inactive. At the opposite extreme enzyme activity reduces below certain temperatures as the enzyme lacks the energy necessary to couple to a substrate. Therefore when the brain or other tissue is at a temperature different from normal body temperature e.g. during hypothermia an isoform of the enzyme is preferably used which has an optimal working temperature at the hypothermic body temperature. In this disclosure such an isoform which is effective at a different temperature is said to have a working temperature at the different temperature or within a range of different temperatures.

In this disclosure the term isoform of an enzyme is used as follows. If a first enzyme catalyzes a reaction at a first temperature and a different enzyme catalyzes the same reaction at a second temperature then the different enzyme is an isoform of the first enzyme within the meaning intended here.

For patients undergoing hypothermia the physician may preferably use a low temperature isoform for patients whose temperatures have been raised the physician may preferably use a high temperature isoform. The form of the enzyme will preferably have an optimal activity curve at or near the desired temperature. Known enzymes are described below followed by a methodology for choosing enzymes which are not yet known.

Researchers have investigated the effect of temperature on the fibrinolytic activity of an SK mixture. In one such effort clots were treated with a mixture of plasminogen 2 mg and SK 100 IU in a total volume of 15 ml PBS. The temperature of the clots was raised from 24 C. to 37 C. These researchers found that heating enhanced the fibrinolytic activity. In other words heating from a hypothermic temperature to normal body temperature increased clot lysing for clots treated with SK.

It is believed that such general trends may be extended to patients without lack of accuracy. Patients may be provided with a drug such as streptokinase and may undergo hypothermia using e.g. one of the devices or methods described above. In particular a cooling catheter may be placed in an artery supplying blood to a thrombosed vessel. The catheter may include a separate lumen through which the SK mixture may be delivered. A coolant or working fluid may be supplied to the cooling catheter causing the same to cool and to cool the blood adjacent a heat transfer element located at a distal tip of the cooling catheter. This cooling step may include the step of inducing turbulence in the blood flowing through the vessel and or in the working fluid. SK may be delivered through the separate drug delivery lumen. The patient may then be rewarmed as the SK is delivered. The rewarming step may be accomplished by passing a warm saline solution as the working fluid.

Researchers have also investigated the effect of temperature on the fibrinolytic activity of tPA. Clots were treated with 2.5 g ml tPA and incubated at various temperatures e.g. 37 C. 25 C. 10 C. 0 C. and 8 C. . Plasminogen activation was relatively high at low temperatures e.g. 0 C. or 8 C. and was much less at higher temperatures. In other words these researchers found that for tPA cooling to a hypothermic temperature from normal body temperature increased fibrinolytic activity.

As above it is believed that such trends may be extended to patients without lack of accuracy. In this case patients may be provided with tPA and may undergo hypothermia using an above device placed in an artery supplying blood to a thrombosed vessel. The catheter may include a separate lumen through which tPA may be delivered. A coolant or working fluid may be supplied to the cooling catheter causing the catheter and the adjacent blood to cool. This cooling step may include the step of inducing turbulence in the blood flowing in the vessel and or in the working fluid. tPA may be delivered through the separate drug delivery lumen. In this case the patient may not be rewarmed until the drug delivery is complete or until the thrombus is dissolved.

Researchers have further investigated the effect of temperature on the fibrinolytic activity of tPA. Clots were treated with tPA in concentrations of 0.3 g ml 1.0 g ml and 3.0 g ml and incubated at various temperatures from 24 C. to 40 C. The amount of clot lysis correlated with temperature at all concentrations. However contrary to the results indicated in Example Four the amount of clot lysis at lower temperatures was less than that at higher temperatures. It is conjectured that heating may have enhanced the activation of plasminogen by the tPA and that such heating may have a similar effect in patients. This general enhancement has also been seen in UK and SK systems.

Further research is clearly necessary to determine the optimal procedure. In any case an embodiment of the method of the invention may be employed to advantageously perform either heating or cooling in an improved way. To enhance the activation of plasminogen by tPA a warm saline solution may be provided in a catheter of the type described above. The warm saline solution transfers heat to the blood at a heat transfer element. An appropriate temperature range for the warm saline solution at a point within the heat transfer element may be about 38 C. to 74 C.

Researchers have also investigated the effect of temperature on the fibrinolytic activity of UK. In one such effort clots were treated with a mixture of UK at temperatures of 4 C. and 28 C. A certain amount of fibrinolytic activity was induced by the introduction of the UK to the clots. Heating to 28 C. caused a second phase of activation resulting in complete conversion of all plasminogen to plasmin and thus increased fibrinolytic activity. In other words heating from a very low temperature 4 C. to a hypothermic temperature 28 C. increased clot lysing. As above it is believed that such trends may be extended to patients. As may be noted this Example may be analogous to that of Example Three because of the rewarming step a similar procedure may be employed to perform the procedure on patients.

The above examples indicate how drugs may be combined with temperature altering devices as e.g. are disclosed above to provide simultaneous cooling and thrombolysis. This combination provides a power dual therapy which may be advantageously employed to aggressively treat stroke and other similar body insults. When dual therapies are employed a cooling catheter may be inserted in one femoral artery for transit to the brain for neural protection. Of course a heating catheter would be employed if a temperature rise were desired. Another catheter may provide the drug delivery. Alternatively the heating or cooling catheter may have disposed therein a lumen for drug delivery. For example the lumen may be coaxial with the catheter and may be disposed along the centerline of the catheter and heat transfer element. Alternatively the lumen may be disposed along one portion of the wall of the outlet lumen. The drug delivery lumen may have an outlet at a tip of the heat transfer element. Examples of such catheters are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09 215 040 filed Dec. 16 1998 and entitled Method and Device for Applications of Selective Organ Cooling the entirety of which is incorporated by reference herein. These drug delivery catheters are particularly useful in dispensing the drug or enzyme regionally into a blood vessel containing the thrombus or into a blood vessel in fluid communication with the thrombosed blood vessel.

The above examples have used known drugs. However for all of the above and for similar techniques an appropriate isoform of an enzyme may be employed to allow enzymatic activity at temperatures other than normal body temperature. One way to choose appropriate isoforms for these enzymes is by searching for the same in cold climates. For example SK is a bacterial enzyme. Bacteria live in many different temperature environments. It is common to find or select an enzyme for a certain process or temperature by finding bacteria that live in environments having the desired temperature.

As another example the polymerase chain reaction is a polynucleotide amplification process that requires an enzyme capable of surviving high temperatures. These enzymes were located in bacteria living in hot springs and thermal vents on the sea floor. Therefore it is likely that certain bacteria that live in room temperature environments or arctic like environments will have enzymes similar to those desired i.e. SK that can survive hypothermic environments.

tPA and UK on the other hand are recombinant forms of human enzymes. As such tPA and UK could be genetically altered to maintain their activity at lower temperatures. For example the protein backbone could be changed to yield higher tPA or UK activity at lower temperatures.

Such temperature specific enzymes or drugs may be advantageously used to localize the effect of the enzymes or drugs. Some enzymes or drugs are considered to have risks associated with their use due to total body effects. For example some thrombolytic drugs are provided only sparingly because of the risk of hemorrhage. This risk is present because current drugs are active at a working temperature which is within the blood temperature range of the vascular system and because the drugs pervade the entire vascular system. The blood temperature range of the vascular system is referred to here as being within a first temperature range and as having an average temperature at a first temperature. Drugs provided to lyse thrombi also reduce clotting throughout the vascular system increasing the risk of hemorrhage. Of course such effects are not limited to thrombolytic drugs.

The invention provides a way to reduce such total body risks. As discussed above an appropriate isoform of an enzyme may be employed to allow enzymatic activity at temperatures other than within a normal body temperature range e.g. the first temperature range described above. In other words for cooling an enzyme may be found with a working temperature range at a hypothermic temperature. Such an enzyme may not work within the above described first temperature range. For example a thrombolytic isoform may lyse clots where the blood temperature is hypothermic but may not produce fibrinolytic effects where the blood temperature is not hypothermic.

This type of drug or enzyme may be advantageously used in the present invention. For example a heat transfer element may be placed in the vasculature upstream of a vicinity in which a clot has formed. The heat transfer element may be used to cool the blood flowing to the vicinity so that the blood in the vicinity achieves a hypothermic temperature. An isoform of a thrombolytic drug may be delivered to the vicinity the isoform having a working temperature at the hypothermic temperature. The isoform of the thrombolytic drug may then act to lyse the clot. The thrombolytic drug does not produce fibrinolytic activity in portions of the vasculature that are not at the hypothermic temperature i.e. the rest of the body. An advantage to this method is that even very strong thrombolytics may be used to effectively lyse clots with significantly less concern about the above described fibrinolytic side effects throughout the remainder of the body.

While the method of the invention has been described with respect to specific devices and techniques which may be used to cool blood other techniques or devices may also be employed. The embodiments of the method of the invention may advantageously employ the turbulence inducing devices and techniques disclosed above to enhance the heat transfer and thus the heating or cooling of the blood.

Furthermore the invention has been described predominantly with respect to a particular lysing system the lysing of a blood clot in a blood vessel such as is caused by stroke or myocardial infarction. However the methods of the invention can be equally applied to altering the activity of any enzyme relative to its activity at normal temperatures. Furthermore the invention may be applied to cooling solids such as volumes of tissue rather than blood flows or static volumes of blood. Moreover the invention can be applied to heating blood or tissue especially when such heating advantageously enhances desired activity in a specific enzyme.

The invention has also been described with respect to certain drug therapies. It will be clear to one of skill in the art that various other drugs may be employed in the method of the invention so long as they have characteristics similar to those described above.

Turning now from thermoregulatory drugs to additional therapies the method and device according to the embodiments of the invention may also play a significant role in treating a variety of maladies involving cell damage. Optimal rewarming strategies for these indications are described later.

A patent application incorporated by reference above discloses devices and methods for enhancing fibrinolysis of a clot by cooling blood flowing in an artery. The present invention may also use blood cooling to substantially reduce platelet aggregation as there is a significant reduction in platelet activity at reduced temperatures. Such reduction may take place by inhibiting enzyme function although the actual methodology is unclear. This reduction in platelet aggregation as well as the enhanced fibrinolysis noted above may reduce or eliminate current dependence on such drugs as tPA or Rheopro.

The above described venous cooling may also provide a number of benefits for patients undergoing myocardial infarction.

Current therapies for treating myocardial infarction involve three areas. Thrombolysis or stenting are used to establish reflow. The oxygen supply is increased by directly supplying the patient with oxygen and by vasodilation with nitrates. And the oxygen demand is lessened by decreasing the heart rate and the blood pressure.

Devices and methods according to the present invention can work well in combination with these current therapies. For example the device and method may lessen the heart s demand for oxygen by providing cooled blood to the heart. The cooled blood in turn cools the inner chambers of the heart essentially from the inside. Hearts undergoing myocardial infarction may beat very fast due to an agitated state of the victim. However cooled blood may induce a state of bradycardia that reduces the demand for oxygen by the heart per se.

To establish reflow and the oxygen supply the enhanced fibrinolysis discussed above may also dissolve the clot allowing more blood flow and more oxygen delivered to the heart. As mentioned above platelet aggregation may be reduced. Additionally conduction through the subendocardium cooling the heart may reduce the overall metabolic activity of the heart as well as protect the subendocardium from cell damage.

It is additionally noted that reflow is often accompanied by reperfusion injury which can further damage cells. Neutrophil activation occurs as part of reperfusion injury. Hypothermia can limit such activation and thus can limit reperfusion injury.

Thus numerous therapies may be delivered by one device. Therefore e.g. currently employed beta blocker drugs used to reduce heart rate in patients undergoing infarcts may not need to be employed in patients undergoing these hypothermic therapies.

Another application of the device and method may be in the treatment of stenotic arteries. Stenotic arteries are vessels that have narrowed due to a build up of tissue and or plaque atheroma. Stenotic vessels are treated by angioplasty or stenting which opens the artery. During treatment the vessel wall may be injured. Such injuries often 20 50 cause an inflammatory reaction that eventually causes the vessel to undergo re stenosis after a period of time which may range from 6 12 months or even several years later.

Hypothermia is known to mitigate inflammatory responses. For example one of the initial steps in the process of re stenosis is the migration of macrophages or white blood cells to the injured area. Hypothermia can limit this migration. Hypothermia can also inhibit reactions and processes initiated by molecules acting in an autocrine or paracrine fashion. Hypothermia may also limit the release of several growth factors at the site of injury such as PDGF and EGF that act in these fashions.

According to one aspect of the present invention a procedure is provided by which a surgeon is able to perform a coronary bypass procedure with hypothermic protection while at the same time avoiding many of the disadvantages associated with the use of traditional external cardiopulmonary bypass systems and aortic clamping procedures.

In one embodiment of the present invention a heat transfer element is provided within a blood vessel of the body such that blood is cooled in vivo upon contact with the heat transfer element.

The heat transfer element can be provided in either arterial or venous blood vessels. One preferred location for the heat transfer element is the inferior vena cava which typically ranges from 15 mm to 25 mm in diameter. A preferred method by which the heat transfer element is provided at this position is via entry at the femoral vein

In the embodiment of the narrowest blood vessel encountered by the heat transfer element as it travels to the inferior vena cava is the femoral artery which generally ranges from 5 to 8 mm in diameter. Accordingly in this embodiment of the invention the diameter of the heat transfer element is about 4 to 5 mm in diameter.

In order to obtain the benefits associated with hypothermia during a coronary bypass procedure it is desirable to reduce the temperature of the blood flowing within the body to less than 35 C. more preferably between 30 and 35 C. and most preferably 32 2 C. Given a typical blood flow rate of approximately 2.5 to 4 l min more typically about 3.5 l min in the inferior vena cava the heat transfer element preferably absorbs 200 to 300 Watts of heat when placed in this vein in order to induce the desired cooling effect. Approximate cooling time is 15 to 30 minutes.

Cooling the body to less than 35 C. provides a number of desirable effects. First cooling will induce a bradycardia of the heart. Reduced heart rates corresponding to about of the normal heart rate are common at the preferred temperature of 32 2 C. By slowing the beating of the heart the present invention facilitates surgery during beating heart procedures. Such procedures are well known in the art. For example the performance of coronary surgery on the beating heart is described by Benetti et al in Coronary Revascularization With Arterial Conduits Via a Small Thoracotomy and Assisted by Thoracoscopy Although Without Cardiopulmonary Bypass Cor. Europatum 4 1 22 24 1995 and by Westaby Coronary Surgery Without Cardiopulmonary Bypass in the March 1995 issue of the British Heart Journal. Additional discussion of this subject matter can be found in Benetti et al Direct myocardial revascularization without extracorporeal circulation. Experience in 700 patients Chest 100 2 312 16 1991 Pfister et al Coronary artery bypass without cardiopulmonary bypass Ann. Thorac. Surg. 54 1085 92 1992 and Fanning et al Reoperative coronary artery bypass grafting without cardiopulmonary bypass Ann. Thorac. Surg. 55 486 89 1993 . Each of the above articles is hereby incorporated by reference.

Moreover the general anesthesia associated with coronary bypass techniques is often accompanied by vasodilation in the patient which decreases organ perfusion and hence increases the risk of ischemia. This effect however is combated by the hypothermia induced in accordance with the present invention which promotes vasoconstriction.

Cooling the body also protects the organs from ischemic damage due to low circulatory flow rates or due to emboli formation. For example as previously noted procedures are known in the art in which 1 the heart is intermittently stopped and restarted or 2 the heart is stopped and a small intracorporeal pump is used to provide circulatory support. These techniques and others like them allow the surgeon to operate on a still or nearly still heart. However each of these techniques also places the patient at risk from ischemia. By lowering the body temperature of the patient to a preferred temperature of 32 2 C. in accordance with the present invention however the oxygen demand of the bodily tissue and hence the danger of ischemia associated with these procedures is reduced.

More specifically with some techniques in which alternating periods of heartbeat and heart arrest are provided the heart is stopped or nearly stopped using drugs such as beta blockers and a pacing device is used to cause the heart to beat on demand. An example of one such system is the TRANSARREST system Corvascular Inc. Palo Alto Calif. In other techniques the heart is momentarily stopped or slowed by electrically stimulating the vagus nerve. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 913 976 and 6 006 134 the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. As noted in U.S. Pat. No. 5 913 876 one or more heart pacing devices such as a Pace port Swann pulmonary artery catheter may be inserted in conventional fashion to the patient s heart and used to restore the beating of the heart during the surgery in the event the heart is slow to revive after a nerve stimulating signal is turned off. Each of these techniques is associated with a circulatory flow rate that can be significantly lower than normal cardiac output.

The risks of ischemia due to low circulatory flow rates however are reduced in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. In particular before manipulating the heartbeat of the patient a heat transfer element is inserted into the vasculature of the patient and the body temperature of the patient is reduced preferably to 32 2 C. As noted above by lowering the body temperature the body s oxygen demand is reduced decreasing the risk of ischemia. Moreover a reduction in body temperature in accordance with the present invention is accompanied by vasoconstriction which decreases the circulatory flow rate that is required for adequate organ perfusion and consequently further decreases the risk of ischemia.

The present invention is also useful in connection with techniques in which the heart is stopped or nearly stopped and an intracorporeal pump is used to support circulation. For example techniques are known in which circulatory support is provided during coronary bypass by a pump positioned in the patient s aortic valve. See for example M. S. Sweeney The Hemopump in 1997 A Clinical Political and Marketing Evolution 1999 Vol. 68 pp. 761 3 the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In this reference a coronary bypass operation is described in which esmolol a short acting beta blocker is administered to calm the heart during surgery. A Medtronic Hemopump is used for circulatory support and the patient s own lungs are used for oxygenation. At the core of the Hemopump is a small rapidly turning Archimedes screw. The pump assembly is made of stainless steel and is attached to a silicone rubber inlet cannula. The cannula is positioned across the aortic valve and into the left ventricle. The pump assembly is catheter mounted to facilitate placement of the pump in its operating position. For example the pump assembly is ordinarily inserted into the femoral artery of the thigh whereupon it is guided to the left ventricle. Once in place the cannula acts to entrain blood and feeds it to the pump portion which then pumps the blood into circulation via the aorta. The pump is operated by the creation of pulsing electromagnetic fields which cause rotation of a permanent magnet resulting in operation of the Archimedes screw. Electrical power is provided from a console outside the patient. The pumping action is axial and continuous i.e. non pulsatile . Due to the design of the Hemopump rotational speeds on the order of 10 000 to 20 000 rpm can be used to produce blood flow of about four liters per minute or less depending on the model without significant hemolysis. Additional details are found in M. C. Sweeney and O. H. Frazier Device supported myocardial revascularization safe help for sick hearts 1992 54 1065 70 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 625 712 the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

This technique and others like it however are frequently associated with circulatory flow rates i.e. about 4 l min or less that are lower than normal cardiac output i.e. about 5 l min for many people placing the patient at ischemic risk. By lowering the body temperature of the patient to a preferred range of 32 2 C. in accordance with the present invention however the blood vessels are constricted and oxygen demand of the bodily tissue is reduced increasing organ perfusion and reducing the danger of ischemia for a given circulatory output.

As noted above in a preferred embodiment of this first aspect of the invention the heat transfer element is provided in the inferior vena cava which is accessed via the femoral vein. In contrast the Hemopump is preferably provided in the left ventricle which is accessed via the femoral artery. In this way both the heating element and the Hemopump can be concurrently placed in the body in a minimally invasive fashion.

According to another aspect of the invention a hypothermic medical procedure is performed on a patient in a conscious or semiconscious state. An example of a situation where such a hypothermic medical procedure may be performed is one in which a patient has suffered a stroke and hypothermia is induced in the brain to reduce ischemic damage.

Such procedures can be performed either to cool the entire body of the patient or a region within the patient s body typically an organ.

The entire body can be cooled using the procedures discussed above. For example the heat transfer element is preferably provided in a venous blood vessel more preferably the inferior vena cava to effect cooling of the entire body.

In order to intravascularly regulate the temperature of a selected region the heat transfer element may be placed in a feeding artery of the region to absorb or deliver the heat from or to the blood flowing into the region. The heat transfer element should be small enough to fit within the feeding artery while still allowing a sufficient blood flow to reach the region in order to avoid ischemic damage. By placing the heat transfer element within the feeding artery of a region the temperature of the region can be controlled while having less effect on the remaining parts of the body. Using the brain as an example the common carotid artery supplies blood to the head and brain. The internal carotid artery branches off of the common carotid to directly supply blood to the brain. To selectively cool the brain the heat transfer element is placed into the common carotid artery or both the common carotid artery and the internal carotid artery. The internal diameter of the common carotid artery ranges from 6 to 8 mm and the length ranges from 80 to 120 mm. Thus the heat transfer element residing in one of these arteries cannot be much larger than 4 mm in diameter in order to avoid occluding the vessel which would result for example in ischemic damage.

When hypothermia is induced in a patient less than desirable side effects can occur in the patient. For example hypothermia is known to activate the sympathetic nervous system in a conscious or semiconscious patient resulting in a significant norepinephrine response. Norepinephrine in turn binds to beta sites including those in the heart causing the heart to beat harder and more rapidly frequently resulting in cardiac arrhythmia and increased risk of myocardial ischemia. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention however a beta blocker is administered to the patient. Without wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that the beta blocker offsets the norepinephrine binding noted above. In general the beta blocker may be administered before the patient cooling commences and preferably immediately before patient cooling commences.

Preferred beta blockers for this aspect of the invention include 1 blockers 1 2 blockers and 1 2 blockers. Preferred 1 blockers include acebutolol atenolol betaxolol bisoprolol esmolol and metoprolol. Preferred 1 2 blockers include carteolol nadolol penbutolol pindolol propranolol sotalol and timolol. Preferred 1 2 blockers include carvedilol and labetalol.

The heightened demand that hypothermia places on the heart of conscious or semiconscious patents may also be relieved for example with heating blankets. However vasoconstriction limits the heating ability of the heating blankets. Without wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that the above noted production of norepinephrine activates alpha receptors for example in the peripheral blood vessels causing this vasoconstriction. The vasoconstriction can be offset in accordance with the present invention by treating the patient with alpha blockers when indicated preferably before cooling is initiated. Preferred alpha blockers include labetalol and carvedilol.

In the various embodiments of the invention once the medical procedure is completed the heat transfer element is preferably used to warm the body back to its normal temperature i.e. 37 C.

According to another aspect of the present invention a procedure is provided in which hypothermia is induced in a human patient in need of neural protection due to ischemic neural conditions by positioning a heat transfer element in a blood vessel of the patient. To enhance the neural protection provided by the induced hypothermia an effective amount of one or more therapeutic agents is administered to the patient which therapeutic agents may include a an antipyretic agent b a free radical scavenger and or c an N methyl D aspartame receptor antagonist.

Preferred antipyretic agents for the purposes of the present invention are antipyretic agents having anti inflammatory properties as well as antipyretic properties such as dipyrone. Dipyrone has been withdrawn or removed for the market in the U.S. but it is available from Hoechst A G. Determining the dosage forms dosage amounts and dosage frequencies that are effective to supplement the neural protection provided by hypothermia is well within the abilities of those of ordinary skill in the art. In the event that the ischemic neural conditions are associated with fever such as that commonly associated with stroke the antipyretic agent is administered until the risk of fever subsides typically at least three days after hypothermia is suspended.

Preferred free radical scavengers for the purposes of the present invention include tirilazad or any pharmaceutically active salts thereof. Tirilazad mesylate which is both a free radical scavenger and a lipid peroxidation inhibitor is manufactured by Upjohn under the trade name FREEDOX and is indicated to improve survival and functional outcome in male patients with aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Determining those dosage forms dosage amounts and dosage frequencies that are effective to supplement the neural protection provided by hypothermia is well within the abilities of those of ordinary skill in the art.

Preferred N methyl D aspartame receptor antagonists for the practice of the present invention include dextrometliorphan MgCland memantine more preferably dextromethorphan and pharmaceutically active salts of the same. Dextromethorphan is commonly found in syrup form and is available from a variety of sources. A preferred dosage for dextromethorphan is 10 to 30 mg orally every four to eight hours for at least three days. Determination of other appropriate dosage forms dosage amounts and dosage frequencies that are effective to supplement the neural protection provided by hypothermia is well within the abilities of those of ordinary skill in the art.

Combinations of the above therapeutic agents are also possible. For example in one preferred embodiment a free radical scavenger and an N methyl D aspartame receptor antagonist are co administered along with the hypothermia.

The method of the present invention is appropriate for various types of ischemic neural conditions including ischemia of the spinal cord cerebral ischemia including stroke and so forth.

The need for neural protection due to ischemic neural conditions can occur in various contexts. In some instances a patient has experienced an unanticipated ischemic injury for example due to physical trauma such as that associated with an automobile accident or due to a pathological event such as a stroke. Under such circumstances it is preferred that hypothermia be induced and therapeutic agent be applied within 6 to 12 hours after the patient has experienced the ischemic injury.

In other instances the patient is at risk of ischemic neural conditions due to a medical procedure such as cardiac surgery brain surgery including aneurysm surgery and so forth. In these instances it is preferred that hypothermia be induced and that the therapeutic agent be administered before to the medical procedure commences.

In addition in some applications it may be advantageous to attach a stent to the distal end of the heat transfer element. The stent may be used to open arteries partially obstructed by atheromatous disease prior to initiation of heat transfer. Further the device may be used to deliver drugs such as blood clot dissolving compounds e.g. tissue plasminogen activator tPA urokinase pro urokinase streptokinase etc. or neuroprotective agents e.g. selective neurotransmitter inhibitors . In addition to therapeutic uses the device may be used to destroy tissue such as through cryosurgery.

A one or two step process and a one or two piece device may be employed to intravascularly lower the temperature of a body in order to treat fever. A cooling element may be placed in a high flow vein such as the vena cavae to absorb heat from the blood flowing into the heart. This transfer of heat causes a cooling of the blood flowing through the heart and thus throughout the vasculature. Such a method and device may therapeutically be used to treat fever.

A heat transfer element that systemically cools blood should be capable of providing the necessary heat transfer rate to produce the desired cooling effect throughout the vasculature. This may be up to or greater than 300 watts and is at least partially dependent on the mass of the patient and the rate of blood flow. Surface features may be employed on the heat transfer element to enhance the heat transfer rate. The surface features and other components of the heat transfer element are described in more detail below.

One problem with treating fever with cooling is that the cause of the patient s fever attempts to defeat the cooling. Thus a high power device is often required.

Of course the use of the superior vena cava is only exemplary. It is envisioned that the following veins may be appropriate to percutaneously insert the heat transfer element femoral internal jugular subclavian and other veins of similar size and position. It is also envisioned that the following veins may be appropriate in which to dispose the heat transfer element during use inferior vena cava superior vena cava femoral internal jugular and other veins of similar size and position. Arteries may also be employed if a fever therapy selective to a particular organ or region of the body is desired.

In a method according to an embodiment of the invention for treating patients with fever the heat transfer element as described may be placed in any of several veins including the femoral the IVC the SVC the subclavian the braichioceplialic the jugular and other such veins. The heat transfer element may also be placed in appropriate arteries for more selective fever reduction.

The amount of cooling performed may be judged to a first approximation by the rate of cool down. The amount of cooling is proportional to the difference between the temperature of the blood and the temperature of the heat transfer element or cooling element. Thus if the temperature of the blood is 40 C. and the temperature of the cooling element is 5 C. the power extracted will be greater than if the temperature of the blood is 38 C. and the temperature of the cooling element is maintained at 5 C. Thus the cool down or cooling rate is generally greatest at the beginning of a cooling procedure. Once the patient temperature begins to approach the target temperature usually normothermia or 37 C. the cooling rate may be reduced because the temperature differential is no longer as great.

In any case once the patient reaches the normothermic temperature it is no longer easy to guess whether in the absence of the cooling therapy the patient would otherwise be feverish or whether the fever has abated. One embodiment of the invention allows a determination of this.

First it is noted that the power extracted can be calculated from the temperature differential between the working fluid supply temperature and the working fluid return temperature. In particular 

Where Pis the power extracted M is the mass flow rate of the working fluid cis the heat capacity of the working fluid and T is the temperature differential between the working fluid as it enters the catheter and as it exits the catheter. Accordingly Pcan be readily calculated by measuring the mass flow of the circulating fluid and the temperature difference between the working fluid as it enters and exits the catheter. The power removed by the catheter as determined above may be equated to a close approximation to the power that is lost by the patient s body.

In general a closed form solution for the power P required to cool or heat a body at temperature T to temperature Tis not known. One possible approximation may be to assume an exponential relationship exp 1 Taking the derivative of each side with respect to temperature 

A close approximation may be obtained by assuming the relationship is linear. Equivalently a power series expansion may be taken and the linear term retained.

In any case integrating assuming a linear relationship and rearranging where the constant of proportionality has units of watts degree Celsius. One can determine the constant of proportionality using two points during the therapy when both T and P are finite and known. One may be when therapy begins i.e. when the patient has temperature T and the catheter is drawing power P. Another point may be obtained when T Tand P P.

An example of this may be seen in which shows a flowchart of an embodiment of a method of the invention. Referring to the figure a patient presents at a hospital or clinic with a fever step . Generally such a patient will have a fever as a result of a malady or other illness for which hospitalization is required. For example the majority of patients in ICUs present with a fever.

The three lumen catheter as shown in has an outer tube an intermediate tube and an inner tube . The catheter has a guide wire space or lumen defined by the inner surface of inner tube . An outer annular lumen is defined between the inner surface of outer tube and the outer surface of intermediate lumen . An inner annular lumen is defined between the inner surface of intermediate tube and the outer surface of the inner tube .

In operation once the catheter is in place a working fluid such as saline or other aqueous solution may be circulated through the catheter . Fluid flows up the inner annular lumen . At the distal end of the catheter the working fluid exits the inner annular lumen and enters outer annular lumen . If the catheter is employed to transfer heat it may be constructed from a highly conductive material so that the temperature of its external surface may reach very close to the temperature of the working fluid. In order to avoid the loss of thermal energy from the working fluid within the inner annular lumen an insulating coaxial layer may be provided within the cooling catheter . In some cases a substantial portion of the entire length of the outer annular lumen may be insulated except at one or more particular locations through which heat is to be directly applied to the portion of the body in contact therewith.

Referring again to the manifold includes a first manifold which provides access to the inner annular lumen via port . The manifold also includes a second manifold which provides access to the outer annular lumen via port . The first manifold also includes a guide wire entry port which provides access to the guide wire lumen for a guide wire not shown . When installed the guide wire generally follows the central axis through the manifold. As shown guide wire entry port may be tapered so that the guidewire can be easily inserted without damage. The first manifold has a proximal end on which a Luer fitting is located.

With reference to an embodiment of a heat transfer catheter system includes a heat transfer catheter a control system and a circulation set housed by the control unit system . The control system may be equipped with an output display and input keys to facilitate user interaction with the control system . A hood is pivotally connected to a control unit housing for covering much of the circulation set .

With reference additionally to in a preferred embodiment the catheter is a heat transfer catheter such as but not by way of limitation a hypothermia catheter capable of intravascular regulation of the temperature of a patient s body or one or more selected organs. The catheter may include a heat transfer element located at a distal portion thereof. In the embodiment of the heat transfer element shown the heat transfer element includes a supply lumen and a return lumen . The supply lumen and return lumen preferably terminate at respective distal points in a distal portion of the heat transfer element and terminate at respective proximal points at a supply lumen port and a return lumen port in catheter handle .

The heat transfer element may be placed in the vasculature of the patient to absorb heat from or deliver heat to surrounding blood flowing along the heat transfer element thereby regulating the temperature of a patient s body or one or more selected organs. In an analogous fashion the heat transfer element may be used within a volume of tissue to regulate the tissue temperature by absorbing heat from or delivering heat to a selected volume of tissue. In the latter case heat transfer is predominantly by conduction.

In an exemplary application the heat transfer catheter may be used to cool the brain. One or more other organs as well as the whole body may also be cooled and or heated i.e. temperature controlled. The common carotid artery supplies blood to the head and brain. The internal carotid artery branches off the common carotid artery to supply blood to the anterior cerebrum. The heat transfer element may be placed into the common carotid artery or into both the common carotid artery and the internal carotid artery via the femoral artery or other well known vascular routes. Heat transfer fluid supplied chilled and circulated by the circulation set causes the heat transfer element to draw heat from the surrounding blood flow in the carotid artery or internal carotid artery causing cooling of the brain to for example reduce the effects of certain body injuries to the brain.

Although the catheter has been described as including a specific heat transfer element it will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that the circulation set of the present invention may be used with heat transfer catheters including heat transfer elements other than the specific heat transfer element described above. Further although the circulation set is described in conjunction with a heat transfer catheter it will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that the circulation set of the present invention may be used in conjunction with catheters other than hypothermia or heat transfer catheters. For example the circulation set may be used with catheters that require a fluid to be supplied to and or circulated through the catheter.

With reference to an embodiment of the circulation set will now be described. The circulation set include one or more of the following a fluid reservoir a pump a filter a heat exchanger a temperature and pressure sensor assembly a supply line and a return line . The supply lumen port and return lumen portion are coupled with respective supply lines and return lines of the circulation set . The supply line and return line are preferably comprised of one or more pieces of tubing connectors etc. for joining the aforementioned components of the circulation set to the supply lumen port and return lumen port . The circulation set may supply filter circulate and or be used to monitor the temperature and pressure of the heat transfer fluid for the catheter . Each of these components will now be described in turn.

In a preferred embodiment the fluid reservoir is a modified 250 ml IV bag made of PVC. The fluid reservoir may be filled with a working fluid such as but not by way of limitation saline freon or perfluorocarbon. In order to prevent the working fluid from causing EMI interference with other electronic devices used in the operating room the working fluid may be a non ionic fluid such as but not by way of limitation D5W D5W with 1.5 glycerine Sorbitol Mannitol and Ringer s Solution.

The fluid reservoir may be used to prime the lines and lumens of the system . The fluid reservoir includes a supply or inlet tube that communicates at an inlet with the return line and communicates at an opposite end or outlet with an inside of the reservoir . The fluid reservoir also includes a return or outlet tube that communicates at one end with the supply line and communicates at an opposite end or inlet with the inside of the reservoir .

The fluid reservoir preferably also includes a mechanism for purging venting or removing air from the system . The air purging mechanism is used to remove air from the lines and lumens of the system and in a preferred embodiment includes a needleless polycarbonate valve with a polycarbonate vented spike . The removal or purging of air from the system is important for maximizing the pressure in the system maximizing heat transfer at the heat transfer element and preventing air from possibly entering the blood stream of the patient caused by a break or leak in the catheter . The outlet of the supply tube may be located closer to the air purging mechanism than the inlet of the return tube or adjacent to the air purging mechanism to inhibit air bubbles supplied by the supply tube from directly entering the return tube without the opportunity to be removed by the air purging mechanism . The purging cycle will be discussed in greater detail below.

In an alternative embodiment of the circulation set the fluid reservoir may supply or prime the system without recirculation of working fluid therethrough. In this embodiment the reservoir may not include the supply tube and the air removal mechanism . The air removal mechanism may be located in the circulation set outside of the fluid reservoir .

The pump is may be a disposable plastic micro pump that is disposed of or discarded with the other disposable components of the circulation set after a single use. The pump is used to draw the heat transfer fluid from the fluid reservoir and circulate the fluid throughout the lines and lumens . In an alternative embodiment the pump may be a permanent non disposable pump.

The filter is preferably a 5 micron filter carried by male and female housing members. The filter removes impurities from the circulating heat transfer fluid. In other embodiments of the circulation set the circulation set may include more than one filter the circulation set may include no filters or the filter may be a part of one or more components of the circulation set .

In the embodiment of the circulation set illustrated in the heat exchanger is a stainless steel tubing that sits in a bath of a second heat transfer fluid made of a biocompatible fluid such as but not limited to galden or ethylene glycol. This is an example of a wet heat exchanger because the tubing resides within a liquid heat transfer fluid. A second heat exchanger not shown located in the control unit housing regulates the temperature of the bath for controlling the temperature of the heat transfer fluid in the system . The heat exchanger is a reusable non disposable wet heat exchanger.

With reference to an embodiment of a dry heat exchanger including a disposable single use heat exchanger member may be used in the circulation set . The heat exchanger member is removably securable within heat exchanger mold members .

The heat exchanger mold members are preferably constructed of a thermoplastic insulative material and may include matching mirrored serpentine grooves therein. The serpentine grooves terminate at one end in an inlet groove and terminate at an opposite end in an outlet groove . The inlet groove and outlet groove accommodate inlet tube and outlet tube of the disposable heat exchanger member and corresponding connection tubes not shown for connecting to the supply line . In an alternative embodiment each heat exchanger mold member may have more than one inlet and or outlet. Instead of serpentine grooves each heat exchanger mold member may include one or more cavities that form reservoirs that heat transfer fluid flows through. First and second heat exchanger surfaces are located on inner faces of the mold members . In a preferred embodiment the heat exchanger surfaces are stamped stainless steel pieces of sheet metal that are bonded to the inner faces of the mold members so as to form heat transfer paths therebetween. The heat exchanger surfaces preferably have serpentine grooves stamped therein. In an alternative embodiment of the invention each groove may have a shape that is other than serpentine or there may be more or less channels in each serpentine groove . The heat exchanger surfaces isolate the disposable heat exchanger member from the heat transfer fluid flowing through the heat transfer paths making the heat exchanger a dry heat exchanger in that the heat transfer fluid e.g. ethylene glycol does not contact the external surface of the disposable heat exchanger member .

The disposable heat exchanger member is preferably constructed of an IV bag and may include the aforementioned inlet tube and outlet tube welded to a bag body .

In use the heat exchanger is opened by separating the first heat exchanger mold member and the second heat exchanger mold member the disposable heat exchanger member is placed therebetween and the heat exchanger is closed by bringing the first heat exchanger mold member and the second heat exchanger mold member together. When the heat exchanger is closed the disposable heat exchanger member conforms to the shape of the serpentine grooves forming corresponding serpentine fluid passages in the disposable heat exchanger member . As working fluid flows through the serpentine passages heat transferred between the heat transfer fluid in the heat transfer paths and heat exchanger surfaces causes corresponding heat transfer between the heat exchanger surfaces and the working fluid in the serpentine passages . After use the heat exchanger member is opened by separating the first heat exchanger mold member and the second heat exchanger mold member and the disposable heat exchanger member is disposed of with the rest of the disposable components of the circulation set .

Thus the heat exchanger is a dry heat exchanger because the external surface of the disposable heat exchanger member does not contact a liquid making it not as messy as the aforementioned coiled heat exchanger that resides in a liquid bath. The heat exchanger member is inexpensive and conveniently disposable after a single use.

In alternative embodiments of the invention the heat exchanger may have a different construction. For example a pair of heat exchangers may be stacked on each other in a double decker fashion sharing a common heat exchanger mold member the disposable heat exchanger member may include a bag with serpentine or other shaped passages already formed therein or the disposable heat exchanger member may be comprised of a stainless steal tube shaped in serpentine or other pattern.

With reference to the temperature and pressure sensor assembly will now be described in more detail. The temperature and pressure sensor assembly is used for measuring the temperature and the pressure of the heat transfer fluid in the supply line before it enters the catheter and measuring the temperature and the pressure of the heat transfer fluid in the return line after it leaves the catheter . These measurements are important for determining the pressure of the heat transfer fluid flowing through the catheter and the heat transfer that occurs at the heat transfer element of the catheter . Heating or cooling efficiency of the heat transfer element is optimized by maximizing the pressure or flow rate of working fluid through the catheter. Although the assembly is described as a temperature and pressure assembly the assembly may be used to measure only temperature or pressure. Further the assembly may be used for measuring other physical characteristics of the working fluid.

The temperature and pressure sensor assembly includes two main components a multi use fixed non disposable temperature and pressure sensor electronics member and a single use disposable temperature and pressure sensor block member .

With reference to the temperature and pressure sensor electronics member includes a base and a latch pivotally coupled thereto by a pin . The base includes an upper surface and a skirt that together define a receiving area for the temperature and pressure block member . The base includes first and second round pressure transducer holes that receive corresponding first and second pressure transducers and first and second round thermocouple holes that receive corresponding first and second thermocouples . The pressure transducers and thermocouples are coupled to electronic circuitry on an undersurface of the base . The electronic circuitry is coupled to the control system via appropriate wiring. The base includes a sloped surface that terminates in a shoulder portion . The latch includes a corresponding catch portion that is biased outward and engages the shoulder portion when the latch is pivoted onto the base . The latch also includes a protruding release member that may be manipulated by a user s fingers to disengage the catch portion of the latch from the shoulder portion of the base .

With reference to the disposable temperature and pressure sensor block member includes a polycarbonate block or base having first and second longitudinally extending lumens or tubes extending therethrough. The longitudinally extending lumens communicate with corresponding first and second pressure transducer wells and first and second thermocouple wells . The pressure transducer wells include central holes that communicate the respective longitudinally extending lumens an inner annular raised portion an outer annular recessed portion and an annular wall . The thermocouple wells include central holes that communicate with the respective longitudinally extending lumens an inner annular recessed portion an outer annular raised portion and an annular wall .

Each pressure transducer well includes an O Ring seal fixed on the outer annular recessed portion a pressure sensor diaphragm fixed on the O Ring seal over the inner annular raised portion and a pressure sensor bushing fixed to the annular wall over the diaphragm . Each thermocouple well includes an O Ring seal fixed on the inner annular recessed portion a sensor connection tube fixed on the O Ring seal and extending into the central hole and a temperature sensor bushing fixed to the annular wall over the sensor connection tube .

The temperature and pressure sensor assembly is assembled by fitting the temperature and pressure block member onto the temperature and pressure electronics member so that the pressure transducers and thermocouples of the electronics member mate with the corresponding pressure transducer wells and thermocouple wells of the block member . The latch is then pivoted to the locked or engaged position so that the catch portion of the latch engages the shoulder portion of the base . This locks the block member to the electronics member .

After a single use of the circulation set or operation using the circulation set the block member is preferably removed from the electronics member and disposed of. This is accomplished by disengaging the catch portion of the latch from the shoulder portion of the base by pulling on the release member . The block member along with the other disposable components of the circulation set are then disposed of. Thus the only reusable component of the pressure and temperature assembly is the temperature and pressure electronics member . The above described construction and configuration of the block member allows for its inexpensive manufacture and thus disposability and the reusability of the electronics member without contaminating any elements of the electronics member .

As discussed infra the air purging mechanism is used to remove air from the lines and lumens of the system . Removing air from the system maximizes the pressure in the system maximizes heat transfer at the heat transfer element and reduces the risk of air entering the blood stream of the patient. The air purging mechanism is employed during a purge phase before each use of the system . The purge phase is important for identification of the type of catheter being used and for early detection of problems with the system .

With reference to a method of automatically identifying a catheter connected to the circulation set or automatically identifying a heat transfer element attached to a catheter that is connected to a circulation set based on a pressure reading in the circulation set will now be described.

With reference additionally to each catheter e.g. 10 F 14 F etc. or heat transfer element connected to a catheter has its own unique flow resistance i.e. pressure versus flow response. If during each discrete step of the purge cycle both the inlet pressure of the catheter and the pump speed are measured a straight line may be drawn through the measured data points and a slope computed. illustrates such sloped lines for a 10 F catheter and a 14 F catheter attached to the circulation set . The catheter or heat transfer element of a catheter used with the circulation set may be automatically identified by comparing the computed slope with a list of similarly computed slopes obtained empirically from a set of available catheters. After automatically identifying the catheter being used the control system may apply the corresponding optimal parameters for operation of the catheter . The computed slope may also be used to determine if a problem has occurred in the system e.g. fluid leakage if the computed slope does not match that of a specific reference catheter.

So far Innercool has completed over 60 patients for its TCAS clinical study in neurosurgery. All of the experimental patients and control were intubated and had an esophageal temperature probe for temperature monitoring. Monitoring temperature in the distal esophagus has been shown to be extremely reliable for monitoring continually core temperature and for providing temperature feedback for controlling the induction and maintenance of hypothermia.

As previously mentioned control algorithms are sometimes used to control the rate at which heat is extracted from the body by the catheter. These algorithms may be embodied in hardware software or a combination of both. The gain factor employed by such algorithms is dependent on the effective thermal mass of the body or organ being cooled. Thus it is important to determine the effective thermal mass so that an appropriate gain factor can be calculated for the feedback control algorithm.

The mass of the body organ or whole body being cooled can be estimated by relating the power removed by the catheter to the power lost by the body.

The power removed by the catheter may be expressed as follows 1 Where M is the mass flow rate of the fluid circulating through the catheter typically measured in terms of cc s c is the heat capacity of the fluid and T is the temperature difference between the working fluid as it enters the catheter and as it exits the catheter. Accordingly Pcan be readily calculated by measuring the mass flow of the circulating fluid and the temperature difference between the working fluid as it enters and exits the catheter.

The power removed by the catheter as determined by equation 1 may be equated to the power that is lost by the patient s body 2 Where Pis now the power lost by the patient s body and has the value calculated by equation 1 m is the effective thermal mass of the body being cooled cis the heat capacity of the body and T t is the change in temperature per unit time of the mass being cooled.

Since all the variables in equation 3 are either known or are measurable the effective mass can be determined.

The mass calculated in this manner is an effective thermal mass that represents the portion of the body from which power is removed i.e. the portion of the body that is cooled . The temperature change in equation 3 represents the temperature change of the portion of the body being cooled. For example if whole body cooling is to be performed the change of the core body temperature may be measured to calculate mass in accordance with equation 3 . In general for whole body cooling if the patient is vasoconstricted the effective mass may represent about 50 of the total body mass. If the patient is vasodilated the effective mass will be closer to the total body mass.

Alternatively if only a selected organ such as the brain is to be cooled then the temperature change that will be used in equation 3 would be the temperature change of the organ assuming of course that the organ can be at least briefly considered to be largely thermally isolated from the remainder of the body. In this case the effective mass that is determined would be comparable to the mass of the organ. If the selected organ to be cooled is the brain for example the catheter is placed in the common carotid artery the internal carotid artery or both. The temperature changed used in equation 3 will be measured by inserting a temperature sensor into the brain or via a tympanic membrane sensor both of which are commercially available.

In an animal study whole body cooling was accomplished by inserting the catheter through the femoral vein and then through the inferior vena cava as far as the right atrium and the superior vena cava. Cooling was initiated by circulating a working fluid at a flow rate of 5 cc sec. The temperature differential between the fluid entering the catheter and the fluid exiting the catheter was 17 C. Accordingly the power extracted by the catheter was 354 watts.

The body core temperature was measured through the esophagus. Twenty minutes after cooling was initiated the rate at which the core temperature changed was measured over a period of about ten minutes resulting in an average temperature change of about 4 C. hr.

The total mass of the animal was 53 kg and thus the effective mass was found to be 69 of the total mass.

As noted certain applications of hypothermia have specified requirements or preferences. Similarly certain applications of rewarming have specified requirements or preferences. These are described below.

In neurosurgery a typical goal is to rewarm the patient from a hypothermic temperature such as about 33 C. to a slightly sub normal temperature such as about 35.5 C. core in a short time. If the rewarm rate is greater than about 2.5 C. this can be achieved in less than an hour. As the typical closure time is 60 minutes this means that rewarming can occur in the operating room as can extubation. A neuro exam may then be performed on the conscious patient.

To accomplish this the following protocol may be performed. The protocol assumes an esophageal temperature probe although other types of temperature probes or sensors may also be employed.

2. The bath temperature through which the working fluid flows in order to exchange heat may be placed at about 50 C. Of course sufficient temperature drops will occur between this and the blood temperature so that the blood temperature does not rise beyond 42 C. 3. The target temperature for the control system may be programmed at about 35.5 C. 4. After achieving target temperature the patient may be moved to a PACU ICU and rewarmed using prior art warming techniques such as convective air blankets etc. Stroke

In stroke a typical goal is to rewarm the patient gradually from a hypothermic temperature such as about 33 C. to a normal temperature such as about 36.5 C. core over an extended period of time such as about 12 to 24 hours. The intracranial pressure ICP is preferably minimized in its rebound and patient comfort is maintained without a shivering or cold sensation. To accomplish this the following protocol may be performed. The protocol assumes a bladder temperature probe although other types of temperature probes or sensors may also be employed.

1. The patient may be warmed by active surface warming such as at about 41 C. to prevent shivering. This warming can be provided by electric blanket or convective air blanket.

2. The console may then provide a controlled rewarm to match the target temperature ramp function. In other words a preferred ramp value may be input by the caregiver this ramp being the rate at which the patient is to be rewarmed. The controller in the console then matches the true rate with this programmed ramp. The ramp would be determined by the amount of time over which the physician wishes the patient s temperature to rise as well as the amount of rise needed to reach normothermia or a pre normothermia temperature such as 36.5 C. 3. The patient may be administered an anti shivering drug such as meperidine. 4. After achieving target temperature the patient may be moved to a PACU ICU and rewarmed using prior art warming techniques such as convective air blankets etc. Cardiovascular Surgery

In cardiovascular surgery a typical goal is to maintain normothermia in the initial perioperative period following separation from cardiopulmonary bypass CPB until e.g. the first 24 hours after the operation. In this regime it would be desirable to rewarm and maintain the patient s temperature at least about 36 C. in the operating room during the last 30 to 45 minutes of closing. Complicating this is that disconnecting from the CPB pump usually yields an after drop of 1 to 2 C. due to redistribution and further heat loss to the environment. It is preferred to not have to use active surface warming during closure or in the ICU.

To accomplish this the following protocol may be performed. The protocol assumes an esophageal temperature probe or that of a PA catheter although other types of temperature probes or sensors may also be employed.

3. Once the patient is off the pump the system is started in rewarming mode and the patient target temperature is set to 36.5 C.

4. When desired or appropriate or after patient reaches the target temperature the catheter may be disconnected from the console in order to transport patient to the ICU.

5. The patient may then be reconnected to the console and rewarming continued along with prior art warming techniques such as convective air blankets etc.

6. Normothermia maintenance may be continued for the next 24 hours or for a time period determined by the physician.

The method of manufacturing a heat transfer element will now be described in more detail. The exterior structure of the heat transfer element is of a complex shape as has been described in order to induce mixing in the flow of blood around the heat transfer element as well as to induce mixing in the flow of working fluid within the heat transfer element. As may be clear many varieties and shapes may be employed to cause such flow. Such shapes are termed herein as mixing inducing shapes . Examples of mixing inducing shapes include helical alternating helical or other enantiomorphic shapes aberration including shapes bump including shapes channel including shapes crenellated shapes hook or horn shapes labyrinthine shapes and any other shapes capable of inducing mixing. Thus the metallic element or elements or compounds forming the heat transfer element must be sufficiently ductile to assume such shapes during deposition.

It is further noted here that while the generic term deposition is used this term is intended broadly to cover any process in which metals or coating may be disposed on a mandrel or other layer of a heat transfer element. For example deposition may include CVD PVD sputtering MBE forms of crystal or amorphic material growth spray coating electroplating ECD and other methods which may be employed to form a mandrel or a coating having a mixing inducing shape. Methods such as ECD and electroplating have the benefit of having a charged workpiece this charge may be employed to fix the workpiece to the tool.

In general the processes which may be employed to form the heat transfer element include forming a mandrel having a mixing inducing shape coating the mandrel with a metal layer or a series of layers i.e. the heat transfer element and dissolving the mandrel.

A first step in the process of forming a heat transfer element may be to form a mandrel. One type of mandrel may be made of aluminum such as Al 6061 with a T6 heat treatment. Aluminum is useful because the same is capable of being dissolved or leached out easily with a caustic soda. A hole disposed along the axis of the heat transfer element may speed such leaching. The mandrel may be formed by machining such as by a Citizen Swiss Screw Machine. The mandrel may also be made via injection molding if the same is made of plastic wax low melting temperature thermoplastics and the like. Other methods which may be employed to form the mandrel include machining via laser note that laser forming is typically only employed for the outside of an element hydroforming and other similar methods.

However the mandrel is formed it is important for the same to have a smooth surface finish and exterior texture. In this way the resulting heat transfer element will be smooth. A smooth mandrel allows an atraumatic device to be formed around the same. A smooth mandrel also allows a smooth metallic coating heat transfer element to be simply deposited around the same thus ensuring uniform heat transfer a constant thickness of biocoating an atraumatic profile etc.

A basic series of coating layers is shown in . shows a mechanical layer typically made of a metal and a biocompatible layer . The mechanical layer is the basic conductive element. The mechanical layer is responsible for heat conduction to provide cooling and thus should have a thermal conductivity in the range of about 0.1 to 4 W cm K so long as such materials can be deposited. Typical metals which may be employed for the mechanical layer include Ni Cu Au Ag Ti Ta nitinol stainless steel etc. or combinations of these or other similar elements. The thickness of the mechanical layer should be less than about 2 mils thick to allow for sufficient flexibility to navigate tortous vasculature although this is strongly dependent on the type of metal and on the tortuousity of the vasculature involved. Regarding the type of metal any noble metal may be employed. Certain of these have deleterious biocompatibility however and each has different manufacturing concerns. For example a Au heat transfer element would require a seed layer since Au will not stick to the Al mandrel.

Ni has been found to be useful. Cu is also useful and has a high conductivity unfortunately Cu is also likely to assume the form of the vasculature in which the same is disposed.

For sake of argument it is assumed here that Ni forms the basic heat transfer element. As stated above Ni is not hemocompatible. Thus a biocompatible layer is disposed on the mechanical layer as is shown in . The biocompatible layer may be e.g. urethane parylene Teflon a lubricious coating an antithrombogenic coating such as heparin a noble metal such as Au or combinations of the above or other similar materials.

One difficulty with the above embodiment may be that with use of certain working fluids such as saline corrosion of the mechanical layer may occur. In the case of a mechanical layer of Ni saline may be especially corrosive. Thus a protective layer may be employed that is noncorrosive with respect to saline. For example the protective layer may be made of Au. A Au protective layer may encounter difficulties attaching to an aluminum mandrel and thus if necessary a layer of Cu may be deposited on the mandrel prior to deposition of the Au layer. Following the dissolution of the mandrel the Cu layer may also be etched away. The protective layer may generally be any noble or inert metal or may be a polymer or other protective material such as Teflon .

Alternatively the protective layer may be vacuum deposited such as by a vapor deposition method following removal or dissolution of the mandrel. The resulting hole left by the dissolved mandrel allows a path for vaporized gases or liquid chemicals to flow. Thus materials can be deposited in this fashion on the inside of the heat transfer element. The materials so deposited may be the same as those discussed above polymers such as non corrosive or non polar polymers noble metals and the like.

Another embodiment is shown in . This embodiment addresses another difficulty that may occur with various metals. For example a mechanical layer that is made entirely of Ni may have too low a burst pressure partially due to its porosity. The protective layer of may address some of these concerns. A better approach may be that shown in . In the mechanical layer is broken up into several layers. Two three or more layers may be employed. In layers and are formed of a first material such as Ni. An interior layer is deposited between layers and . This layer may be formed of a second material such as Cu. This combination of layers and forms a mechanical sandwich structure. The Cu layer the second metal or layer may serve to close pinholes that may exist within the more porous Ni layers and the first metal or layer .

One embodiment that has been found useful is that described by Table I below. In Table I the biocompatible coating is a noble metal layer of Au. It should be noted that Table I describes a very specific embodiment and is provided purely for illustrative purposes. Table I should not be construed as limiting. Table I is keyed to .

The overall thickness of the group of layers may be about 1 mil. The nickel and copper may contain traces of other elements without deleterious consequences.

While the particular invention as herein shown and disclosed in detail is fully capable of obtaining the objects and providing the advantages hereinbefore stated it is to be understood that this disclosure is merely illustrative of the presently preferred embodiments of the invention and that no limitations are intended other than as described in the appended claims.
