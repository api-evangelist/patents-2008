This invention relates generally to service oriented architectures and more particularly to a system article and method that provide a situationally aware software information tool that maps user roles to a consistent set of tags.

Service Oriented Architecture SOA is a development of distributed computing and modular programming in which existing or new technologies are grouped into autonomic systems. SOAs employ software services to build applications. Services are relatively large intrinsically unassociated units of functionality with externalized service descriptions. SOAs typically implement functionalities most humans would recognize as a service such as filling out an online application for an account viewing an online bank statement or placing an online booking or airline ticket order. Thus SOA serves to align business and information technology IT .

In an SOA environment instead of services embedding calls to each other in their source code protocols are defined that describe how one or more services may talk to each other. In an SOA environment one or more services communicate with one another by passing data from one service to another or coordinate an activity between one or more services. In addition independent services may be accessed without the knowledge of the underlying platform implementation. In this manner autonomic services may be orchestrated into higher level services. In SOA the application architecture has all its functions and services defined using a description language having invokable interfaces that are called to perform business processes. In SOA each interaction is independent of each and every other interaction and the interconnect protocols of the communicating devices i.e. the infrastructure components that determine the communication system do not affect the interfaces . Because interfaces are platform independent a client from any device using any operating system in any language can use the service

A current challenge in SOA development is to build business driven composite services atop of autonomic informational services. By defining a methodology for the use and re use of software services and business processes which typically encompass multiple service invocations SOA has the potential to provide a great deal of flexibility and cost savings to enterprises that rely on information technology IT .

The SOA concept is based upon an architectural style that defines an interaction model between three primary building blocks a a service provider which publishes a service description and provides the implementation for the service b a service requester which can either use the uniform resource identifier URI for the service description directly or find the service description in a service registry and bind and invoke the service and c a service broker which provides and maintains the service registry using for example the Universal Description Discovery and Integration UDDI specification which defines a way to publish and discover information about web services.

A web service is a software application designed to support interoperable machine to machine interaction over a network and is frequently simple web application program interfaces API that may be accessed over a network such as the Internet and executed on a remote system hosting the requested services. Web services may provide an example of an SOA implementation in which the basic unit of communication is a message rather than an operation by making functional building blocks accessible over standard Internet protocols that are independent from platforms and programming languages.

 Web 2.0 is a term that refers to an increasingly frequented type of web application that is primarily distinguished by the ability of visitors to continually contribute information for collaboration and sharing. Web 2.0 applications use web services and may include composite user interfaces that provide combinations of various service technologies such as collaborative and social software web syndication weblogs and wikis. While there are no set standards for Web 2.0 Web 2.0 is a user driven architecture of participation that utilizes the SOA characteristics of building on the existing architecture and using services. The evolving technology infrastructure of Web 2.0 includes various applications that may provide users with information storage creation and dissemination capabilities that go beyond what had formerly been expected of web applications.

A number of Web 2.0 applications feature the extensive use of folksonomies. A folksonomy involves the practice of collaborative categorization using freely chosen tags that is metadata in the form of descriptive keywords or terms associated with or assigned to a piece of information and arises in web applications in which special provisions are made at the site level for creating and using tags for web content. Collaborative tagging in this fashion is intended to enable a body of information to be increasingly easy to search discover and navigate over time and folksonomies are commonly used to label classify and retrieve web content such as web pages digital images Internet bookmarks and web links. As folksonomies develop in web mediated social environments users often discover the tag sets of another user who tends to interpret and tag content in a way that makes sense to them. The use of folksonomies may result in an immediate and rewarding gain in user capacity to find related content.

Flickr and del.icio.us are examples of websites that use folksonomic tagging to organize content. Flickr is a digital image storage and management service that is configured with a user interface to tag images with descriptive nouns verbs and adjectives and systematically perform CRUD create read update and delete operations on photography entries. del.icio.us is a social bookmarking site that is configured for users to create and store Internet bookmarks and then tag the bookmarks with many descriptive words facilitating others to search by those terms to find sites that have been found useful.

Within the realm of a business enterprise and its network of partners there are numerous opportunities for collaboration. The use of Web 2.0 technologies and SOA principles has the potential to increase the reach and improve the richness of this interaction in enterprise informational services leading to more efficient development of new business models and processes by using readily available intuitive modular elements. By creating an environment in which employees can collaborate efficiently by leveraging each other s intellect and resources employees can create stronger and more successful products. Nevertheless most software that is touted as enabling enterprise collaboration is difficult to use cumbersome and does not adequately empower employees to share their content. This results in SOA implementations that undesirably add more custom logic and increased complexity to an IT infrastructure. A big hurdle for the typical large enterprise is the ability to standardize knowledge practice across that enterprise and to implement tools and processes that support that aim.

An example of an enterprise or business driven collaborative enterprise environment is that of a composite service system. A composite service system comprises a collection of collaborative or interactive services which aggregate domain specific or context aware content information that may be utilized by employees to maintain consistency across all of the enterprise informational services. Examples of systems that may be implemented in this fashion include project management systems which are used to schedule track and chart the steps in a project as it is being completed workflow systems which enable the collaborative management of tasks and documents within a knowledge based business process and knowledge management systems which are used to collect organize manage and share various forms of information. Operations such as record management content management collaborative software workflow or business process management and other mechanisms designed to capture the efforts of many into a managed content environment are typical of these workplace collaboration technologies.

Domain knowledge is the body of knowledge about a particular activity environment. In an enterprise domain knowledge has traditionally been organized formally or informally in an institutionally supported taxonomy that is domain specific. Domain knowledge may be kept in data repositories such as Lotus Notes Teamrooms ad hoc websites knowledgebases social bookmarks or applications and so on. A workplace generated folksonomy would be useful for example with business driven collaborative or interactive management systems of composite services that are designed to help employees working on a common task achieve their goals.

However the unsystematic methodology of folksonomic tagging may be unreliable and inconsistent for use in large enterprises. Typically there is no information about the meaning or semantics of a tag and because of the lack of a hierarchical or systematic structure for the tagging system the terms often fail to show their relationship to other objects of the same or similar type or lead to irrelevant connections between objects. In a situation where a user is in a collaborative or social software environment has found a new important piece of information or has posted new content relevant to the community on an external collaborative software application the user may only employ existing folksonomies or create a tag on the fly which may not be consistent with the domain specific taxonomy. Thus while this user will be aware of the new object other users in the same environment will not encounter this new information when performing tag searches using for example a feed reader.

When a tagging system is defined informally continually changing and lacking governance it may be burdensome to use the tags so constructed to automate workflow and business processes and tags associated with resources could grow to unruly proportions. Keeping track of this information is challenging and as the use of collaborative and social software increases both internally that is within a corporate firewall and externally or publicly the issue of synchronizing tagged information between the public and private spaces becomes a greater concern as the public social software applications are not aware of the private domain specific tags or taxonomies.

Embodiments of the present invention include a method article and system for role based situationally aware software the method includes mapping a user to one or more communities of practice CoP aggregating a series of tags from the one or more CoP to form an initial set of user role based tags filtering the initial set of user role based tags based on user context elements to form context sensitive user role tags querying one or more information services based on the context sensitive user role tags aggregating information obtained from querying the one or more information services and providing the aggregated information to the user as dynamic context related content.

An article comprising one or more computer readable storage media containing instructions that when executed by a computer enables a role based situationally aware software application that maps user roles to a consistent set of tags wherein the method further includes mapping a user to one or more communities of practice CoP aggregating a series of tags from the one or more CoP to form an initial set of user role based tags filtering the initial set of user role based tags based on user context elements to form context sensitive user role tags querying one or more information services based on the context sensitive user role tags aggregating information obtained from querying the one or more information services and providing the aggregated information to the user as dynamic context related content.

A system for a situation based software information tool that maps user roles to a consistent set of tags the system includes one or more server devices in communication with one or more client devices through a network the server devices and the client devices configured to execute electronic software wherein the electronic software is resident on storage mediums in signal communication with the client and server devices wherein the electronic software comprises a series of instructions configured for mapping a user to one or more communities of practice CoP aggregating a series of tags from the one or more CoP to form an initial set of user role based tags filtering the initial set of user role based tags based on user context elements to form context sensitive user role tags querying one or more information services based on the context sensitive user role tags aggregating information obtained from querying the one or more information services and providing the aggregated information to the user as dynamic context related content.

As a result of the summarized invention a solution is technically achieved for a method article and system for providing a situationally aware software information tool that maps user roles to a consistent set of tags.

The detailed description explains the preferred embodiments of the invention together with advantages and features by way of example with reference to the drawings.

Software professionals architects developers etc. utilize software development information furnished by an enterprise to carryout their assigned tasks. However software development information in an enterprise is often static and thus maybe outdated. Furthermore it is generally distributed in different information repositories and is not situationally based and therefore does not take into account a software professional s particular circumstances. As a result software professionals are challenged with assembling current software development information and assessing the applicability of the assembled software development information against their specific situation.

A typical software development situation from the software professional s perspective has four primary elements content context tooling and method. The main problem facing software professionals is that there is no comprehensive solution that dynamically aggregates information from disparate sources based on the situational factors. Software professionals require the ability to obtain and interpret information from numerous disparate information sources to make decisions throughout a software development lifecycle. Moreover software professionals require context specific information on tooling best practices assets and patterns of asset usage based on situational factors such as their role membership to communities of practice CoPs current place or position in a method industry vertical context current file type in use e.g. UML model and current tool in use.

For example a large IT company has just hired an experienced senior software architect who is assigned to work on a large scale SOA implementation project. The senior software architect possesses a strong software engineering background but is not familiar with the IT company s methods tools and best practices. Moreover the senior software architect has not yet established working relationships with others on the project. The information that is required by the senior software architect to be productive on the project is dispersed among numerous web applications repositories knowledge bases forums and ad hoc web sites around the company. Moreover the information is not situationally based nor is it compiled in any single location therefore just knowing where to start is a huge challenge for the senior software architect.

Continuing with the example the senior software architect reports to their position at the IT company and learns that the architecture team will be unable to help them get up to speed for at least week or more. Furthermore the senior software architect s immediate supervisor is out on vacation. In addition other people are working in completely different domain areas and are not able to provide assistance to the senior software architect.

However the senior software architect has been asked to start work on a Service Specification task that is defined in the IT company s software development process. The IT company has an on boarding document which does contain some pointers to useful information but the on boarding document does not have the situationally based context specific information that the senior software architect requires to carry out the Service Specification tasks. Moreover the on boarding document is out of date and does not have links to some critical websites and knowledge bases that the senior software architect will need and in addition many of the key subject matter experts listed in the on board document have left the company.

Therefore as a consequence of the senior software architect s current circumstances the senior software architect does not have access to the full complement of information that they require to perform their assigned task properly and efficiently. Moreover the senior software architect is unable to elaborate on their situational factors such as tooling or methods and as a result gaps exist in their context. Thus any information the software architect does obtain will be incomplete or obsolete.

The present example situation encountered by the senior software architect is not uncommon even when assistance is available because software development information is typically static may be out of date and is dispersed among disparate information sources. Moreover the information is not situationally based. Therefore a software professional not only has to discover the appropriate information from multiple places but is also required to make an assessment as to which portions of the information apply to their particular situation. Therefore currently available prior software development information lacks situational context that may be used to dynamically generate context specific information based on a user s situational factors.

Embodiments of the invention provide a method article and system that provide a situation based software information tool that maps user roles to a consistent set of tags. The tags are built up from a combination of personal user tags and tags from various communities of practice that the user in that role would belong to. Embodiments of the invention continuously filter the initially formed tag set as the user context changes to form new context sensitive tag subsets. Context changes include tooling used place and type of software development method industry vertical that the user is operating in etc. Embodiments of the invention use the context sensitive tag subset to dynamically query and aggregate content from disparate informational and asset sources.

Based on a role embodiments of the invention utilize a table that maps that role to the relevant communities of practice. In embodiments of the invention a user may have many roles such as a personal role or a Community of practice CoP role. For example a user may want to be in a personal role where the user wants to manage their tags around the entire Web 2.0 application that they are involved with. A user in the CoP role such as a CoP of all IBM developers may want to manage or use a domain specific tag for their CoP. Each one of these communities of practice would have a set of consistent tags associated with that community. For a particular role a starting set of consistent tags is assembled from the relevant communities. This starting set of consistent tags represents an initial taxonomy for that role.

ISSW members are a team of highly skilled consultants with broad architectural knowledge deep technical skills best practices expertise and close ties with IBM research and development labs. Services offered by ISSW consultants and developers include skills transfer implementation migration architecture and design services as well as customized workshops and education to fit various customer business needs. WebSphere refers to an IBM brand name that encompasses tools for developing e business applications and middleware for running web applications. IBM Software Services for WebSphere makes it easy for clients and partners to design build test and deploy solutions helping them to become an on demand business.

Continuing with each one of these CoPs have their own set of consistent unique tags which are aggregated together to give an initial set of tags for that role. In an exemplary embodiment the ISSW developer in the ISSW CoP is involved in a series of technical discussions tech chats that are recorded and tagged as issw tech chat and users employing the transformation technology called design pattern toolkit DPTK which provides a template engine for generating applications based on customizable model to text transformations are tagged as dptk users. In the exemplary Websphere CoP users that are utilizing Websphere application server version 6 and all related information sources about this product are tagged was v6. In addition a core component of SOA architectures is the enterprise service bus and all related information sources referring to the enterprise service bus are tagged enterprise service bus. In the exemplary IBM Developer CoP the Java program script is utilized. Consistent Java architectures are built up with Java best practices that are referred to as Java patterns and all related information sources about the Java patterns are tagged with a java pattern tag. Best practices for how to write a program utilizing Java is provided by guidance called Java style and all related information sources about Java style are tagged with a java style tag.

The resultant taxonomy of is context independent and following the development of the initial set of tags the initial set of tags is filtered. As the user in this role becomes context aware the taxonomy is filtered based on the context. Context elements for filtering the initial set of tags include the skill level the user has in the role the preferred language of the user in the role the industry vertical the user in the role is in the method the user in the role is using where the user in the role is in the method what tool including version the user in the role is using what file type the user in the role is using what file type the user in the role is using with the tool custom context usually supplied by a team leader and the location of the user in that role.

Following the filtering of the initial set of tags the resultant subset of tags referred to as context sensitive user role tags are then used to query backend informational services to dynamically provide content to the user based on the user context. Information services that are assessed include bookmark services media services asset services people services educational services and social software services e.g. blogs and wiki . Embodiments of the invention dynamically aggregate the information from these disparate sources to construct software development information.

A further example application of embodiments of the invention may be a patent agent taking the place of a software developer as the user role in question involved in composing patent applications. In this example the patent agent may belong to a number of CoP such as a patent agents CoP a lawyers CoP the firm the agent works for CoP etc. The patent agent may also have created their own set of personal tags from bookmarks podcasts YouTube movies online libraries etc. Combining and filtering these tags a user in role sub set of tags for the patent agent is obtained. As the patent agent creates the patent application the patent agent is in certain contexts such as a claims drafting context. In each context the agent will require access to tools and boilerplates. Using the dynamic tag creation described in embodiments of the invention the creation of a set of context aware user in role set of tags may be created to accurately reflect the agent user in role in this context drafting claims to the information that the agent may need such as the relevant document on patenting guidelines from the patent filing office the correct document boiler plate to use relevant book marks and other related assets.

Exemplary embodiments of the invention may be implemented to provide a mechanism for maintaining separate distinct sets of application specific and group domain specific tags for a user in an SOA environment or model that is designed to provide user access to integrated tag based services and process such as Web 2.0 applications that include features for collaborative tagging of web content. In exemplary embodiments the mechanism may be configured to maintain a distinct tag set for each of a number of separate identities or roles that the user may desire to take on in the SOA environment.

Referring now to there is depicted an exemplary data processing system that may be utilized to implement exemplary embodiments of the present invention. For discussion purposes the data processing system is described as having features common to a personal computer such as a desktop or portable computer. As used herein however the terms data processing system computer and the like are intended to mean essentially any type of computing device or machine that is capable of receiving storing and running a software product including such devices as communication devices for example pagers telephones electronic books electronic magazines and newspapers etc. and personal and home consumer devices for example handheld computers web enabled televisions home automation systems multimedia viewing systems gaming consoles etc. .

Data processing system as provided in is configured as a personal computer that generally includes a processing unit a system memory and a system bus that couples system memory to processing unit . The system memory includes flash memory and random access memory RAM . Flash memory is an electrically erasable programmable read only memory EEPROM module that includes a basic input output system BIOS . BIOS contains the basic routines that facilitate transfer of information between elements within personal computer such as during start up.

Data processing system further includes a hard disk drive a magnetic disk drive which can be used to read from or write to a removable disk and an optical disk drive which can be used to read a CD ROM disk or read or write to other optical media . Hard disk drive magnetic disk drive and optical disk drive are electrically communicatively coupled to system bus by a hard disk drive interface a magnetic disk drive interface and an optical drive interface respectively. The drives and their associated computer readable media provide nonvolatile storage for data processing system . Although the description of computer readable media above refers to a hard disk a removable magnetic disk and a CD ROM disk it should be appreciated that other types of media that are readable by a computer such as magnetic cassettes flash memory cards digital video disks Bernoulli cartridges and the like may also be used in exemplary computer operating environments.

A number of program modules may be stored in the drives and RAM including an operating system application program modules such as for example word processors design applications and IBM s Workplace Forms suite of program modules and program data . A user may enter commands and information into data processing system through a keyboard and a mouse . Other input devices not shown may include for example a microphone joystick game pad satellite dish scanner or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to processing unit through a serial port interface that is coupled to system bus but may be connected by other interfaces such as a game port or a universal serial bus USB . A monitor or other type of display device is also connected to system bus via an interface such as a video adapter . In addition to the monitor the exemplary computer operating environment may also include other peripheral output devices not shown such as speakers or printers.

Data processing system may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers such as a remote computer . Remote computer may be for example a server a router a peer device or another common network node and may include many or all of the elements described in relation to data processing system . The logical connections depicted in include a local area network LAN and a wide area network WAN .

Modem which may be internal or external to data processing system is connected to system bus via serial port interface . In a networked environment program modules depicted relative to data processing system or portions thereof may be stored in the remote memory storage device. It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.

Exemplary embodiments of the present invention may be implemented in conjunction with an SOA environment such as for example an integrated web services implementation in which the SOA supports integration and consolidation of any number of services and processes. Web services are self contained self describing modular applications that may be described located and invoked over a computer network such as the World Wide Web. Web services utilize standardized interfaces and protocols for example a web Application Programming Interface API to implement consolidation and integration methods that allow different entities or web based applications to communicate data logic and processes with one another over a network. These standardized methods permit different applications to exchange resources with other entities or applications that are running on different operating systems. In an SOA environment the SOA may define a interface through which a service requesting or client side party may access web services or enterprise based services provided within an enterprise domain specify or consolidate a set of web services or web service providers that may be invoked through the interface and define protocols for communicating with the set of web services through the SOA interface.

Client applications are software applications that include one or more sequences of instructions that are executable by one or more processors. For example applications may be programs that are executable on a computer system such as the data processing system illustrated in described above. Web services may include some combination of programming and data that are made available through application server for end users and other network connected application programs. In exemplary embodiments web services may comprise one or more web applications that are implemented to allow users of client applications to communicate therewith to create and store folksonomic tags for describing web content such as for example digital images or internet bookmarks.

When a client application needs to invoke a remote web service at application server the invoking client application generates a request message describing arguments to be given to the web services and requests processing by the web services. Upon receiving the request message application server performs the processing for the requested web services and returns a response message describing any return values of the processing to the client application.

ESB which is a component of enterprise domain in the present exemplary embodiment serves to provide an enhanced messaging middleware infrastructure for the enterprise domain and provides the set of capabilities through which the SOA may be implemented. The capabilities provided by ESB may include for example invocation routing mediation messaging mediation messaging process choreography service orchestration complex event processing and management functions. In general ESB serves as a centralized broker that handles issues relating to security access and communication in the SOA environment. In exemplary embodiments ESB may be configured to perform data integration to ensure that information is kept consistent within the SOA environment provide a common user interface through which client applications may access the web services that are specified by the SOA and to extract policies or rules from the specified web services so that if one service is replaced with a different vendor s services in the SOA specification the business rules do not have to be re implemented. In alternative exemplary embodiments ESB may be a vendor provided service bus that is external to enterprise domain .

In one particular exemplary capability ESB serves as a message mediator by receiving processing and passing request messages from client applications and response messages from web services such that the services can be called to perform their tasks in a standard way without the services having foreknowledge of the calling client applications and without the client applications having or needing knowledge of how the services actually perform their tasks. In exemplary embodiments the message processing performed by ESB may be built upon generally accepted web services standards and protocols such as for example XML a markup language for describing data in message payloads in a document format HTTP or HTTPS a request response protocol between clients and servers used to transfer or convey information SOAP a protocol for exchanging XML based messages over a computer network normally using HTTP and XACML a markup language for expressing access control rules and policies .

ESB and web services communicate with each other as well as with other applications and web service systems through network . Network is configured to receive and pass on request and response messages accordingly and to use the transportation protocol or protocols used by messages. Network includes intranets extranets and the Internet and may contain any number of network infrastructure elements including routers switches gateways etc. For example network may be the public Internet or a private LAN. In exemplary embodiments ESB may also communicate with other web service providers to provide other web services and applications through network to client applications as well as with enterprise service providers through an intranet within enterprise domain that provide other services and processes such as enterprise legacy services to the client application.

Application server provides web services to client applications through network . A web server application processing unit such as WebSphere a product of International Business Machines Corporation oversees the execution of multiple web services that reside on application server . Network passes each request message to and receives each response message from application processing unit through a message gateway such as for example a proxy firewall or other message intermediary. Message gateway receives request messages from network and passes response messages to the network. Message gateway performs lexical analysis of request messages to create input objects including parameters for invocation of one or more of web services . Message gateway sends input objects to web service application processing unit which calls the appropriate web services that correspond to the method invocation of the input objects executes the appropriate logic and returns the result as output objects that include the return values of the invoked web service s to the message gateway. Message gateway converts output objects into response messages and transmits the response messages through network to the invoking client applications.

Application processing unit may also be supported by a database management system which may be any conventional data repository for storing managing and retrieving data. In exemplary embodiments database may be a relational or object relational database management system such as DB2 a product of International Business Machines Corporation. In exemplary embodiments database may be internal to application server as shown in or alternatively reside externally on a separate machine. In exemplary embodiments application server may use a single database to serve multiple web services as shown in or alternatively use a separate database for each separate web service.

Referring now to a block diagram of an exemplary embodiment of a tag set manager system in accordance with embodiments of invention is illustrated. Tag set manager may be implemented for instance within enterprise domain of the SOA system of to provide a mechanism for managing and maintaining separate distinct sets of domain specific tags for a client side user in an SOA environment that implements a methodology for providing client applications with access to a specified set of integrated tag based services and processes that include features for collaborative tagging of web content. In the present exemplary embodiment the user is operating a local computer running a portal client application that provides a user interface implemented in accordance with the SOA and through which the user may access the applications that are specified by the SOA. In exemplary embodiments the SOA specification may include Web 2.0 and other collaborative or social software applications such as for example del.icio.us Flickr Technorati Last.fm and Wrike. In the exemplary SOA of the specification is shown as including Web 2.0 applications collaborative software applications and social software applications as provided by a number of web service providers through a communications network as well as including applications provided by a local Intranet service provider .

As shown in managing system includes a user or client side agent or proxy for example Firefox or Internet Explorer a personal database management system a group domain data management system and a messaging intermediary . Databases may be any suitable type of data repository for storing managing and retrieving data that comprises sets of personal and domain specific tags and other metadata associated with tag based applications.

In exemplary embodiments databases may be a relational or object relational database management systems such as DB2. In exemplary embodiments the databases may be internal to local computer running a client application or alternatively reside externally on a separate machine within the enterprise domain. In exemplary embodiments client application may employ a single personal database to store tag sets for one or more roles and a jointly usable domain specific group database to store tag sets for each group domain of which the user is a member as shown in or alternatively employ separate databases to store tag sets for each separate role and or a separate user specific group database to store tag sets for each group domain of which the user is a member.

In exemplary embodiments each database may be configured to store a distinct tag set for one of a number of separate identities or roles that the user may desire to take on in the SOA environment. In this manner the sets of tags could be maintained independently of any of the tag based application provided for in the SOA. For example the user may wish to have a tag set for a personal role that is maintained separately from a tag set for a separate role as a member of a group domain such as Community of Practice CoP which refers to a group that is composed of members who share a meaningful relationship and work together to expound their collective knowledge on a topic through collaboration to share ideas find solutions and build innovations. In this example the CoP to focus knowledge management in community may wish to provide a pre defined set of domain specific tags for its members to employ when using tag based collaborative or social software. The user in a role as a member of a CoP may thus desire to synchronize some of their tag sets with a specified set of domain specific tags for the CoP for each of the tag based application with which they are involved while the user may wish to personally manage a separate set of tags for each or all of the tag based services with which the user interacts in a personal role outside of the CoP. In exemplary embodiments agent which may access the tag set databases over message intermediary may provide this functionality.

In exemplary embodiments the user s tag sets may be stored as directory entries according to the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol LDAP and the databases could be implemented as an LDAP directory. LDAP is an application protocol for querying and modifying directory services running over TCP IP. LDAP directories comprise a set of objects with similar attributes organized in a logical and hierarchical manner as a tree of directory entries. Each directory entry has a unique identifier identifying for example for one of the user s roles and consists of a set of attributes for example the tag based applications in the SOA and the tag sets for each of applications along with additional metadata . The attributes each have a name and one or more values and are defined in a schema.

In exemplary embodiments agent may be configured to in response to commands from the user initiate an LDAP session by connecting to one of the databases send operation requests to the database and receive responses sent from the database in return. Agent may be configured to search for and retrieve tag entries associated with specific user roles and tag based applications compare tag terms and other attribute values add delete modify the user s roles tag sets and tag and tag based application attributes import tags and tag sets from existing databases and directories etc. By binding tag set attributes for each particular user role with a particular entry in an LDAP directory or within an alternative data model or directory type agent may associate each particular role with content submitted or posted in that specific role so that it may be used consistently whenever tags are posted by the user or whenever tags that have already been posted by the user are detected.

In the present exemplary embodiment agent is a self contained interactive object configured to execute concurrently with client application to act on behalf of the user running client application . In exemplary embodiments agent can be configured to provide a user interface through which the user can interact with the agent to instruct it to perform desired functionality. For example agent can be implemented as a web browser that enables the user to display and interact with text images and other information at each of the tag based applications provided for in the SOA. In another example client application may comprise a web browser and agent may be implemented as a browser applet such as an Adobe Flash or Java application to provide part of or the entire user interface. In exemplary embodiments agent may be implemented according to the WS CAF web service standard to provide composite functionality of each of the tag based applications specified in the SOA through the user interface.

In the present exemplary embodiment when client application or agent needs to invoke a remote application server the invoking application generates a request message describing arguments to be given to an application specified in the SOA and requests processing by the application. Messaging intermediary which comprises a communications middleware component supporting a variety of communications paradigms APIs platforms and standard protocols receives the request message from the invoking application processes the message in accordance with specified business rules and provisions determines the location of the requested service provider for example by accessing service registry and sends the message to the appropriate service provider. In exemplary embodiments messaging intermediary may be configured based upon standards such as XML SOAP UDDI and WSDL. Upon receiving the request message application server performs the processing for the requested web services and returns a response message describing any return values of the processing to message intermediary which in turn returns the response message to the invoking application.

Messaging intermediary which may be a component of an enterprise service bus such as ESB of is configured to transform message formats between clients and service providers route requests to the correct service providers and convert transport protocols between clients and providers. For example if a service provider expects encrypted messages message intermediary may include such a capability in request messages sent to that provider. Messaging intermediary may be configured to provide virtualization of the applications according to rule and specifications of the SOA to client application and agent allowing the logic of those applications to be developed and managed independently of the infrastructure network and other provisions of the services specified in the SOA. In this manner messaging intermediary may help promote loose coupling between client application and the service providers.

In the present exemplary embodiment message intermediary and service providers communicate with each other through network . Network is configured to receive and pass on request and response messages accordingly and to use the transportation protocol or protocols used by messages. Network includes intranets extranets and the Internet and may contain any number of network infrastructure elements including routers switches gateways etc. For example network may be the public Internet or a private LAN. In the present exemplary embodiment message intermediary also communicates with Intranet service provider according to transportation protocols specified for the local domain. In exemplary embodiments as specified by the SOA message intermediary may also communicate with other web service providers to provide other web services and applications through network to client application as well as with other local domain service providers that provide other services and processes such as enterprise legacy services to the client application.

In the present exemplary embodiments agent is configured to act on instructions provided by the user to access a database through message intermediary to load a set of tags that corresponds to a tag based application specified by the user and a role specified by the user display the first set of tags to the user and to communicate with the service specified by the user to post tags selected by the user from the displayed set of tags to content at the service. In exemplary embodiments agent may provide a seamless user experience by not requiring multiple logins. At the time the user logs in to agent the user can specify a role for example the user can connect to the agent in a personal role or as a member of a group domain such as a CoP . Agent is configured to be aware of each of the tag based applications that client application may access through the SOA as well as each specified role that the user may desire to use when logging in to the agent. In exemplary embodiments agent can be configured to supply any necessary login information to connect to each of the tag based applications specified by the SOA on behalf of the user in each of the specified roles for the user. In exemplary embodiments when the user logs into the agent the agent can then either automatically log the user into all of the tag based applications specified by the SOA or automatically log the user into and out of each of the tag based applications at separate times as desired by the user.

In the present exemplary embodiment because agent has access to each set of tags maintained for the user in databases over message intermediary the agent can be configured to allow for dynamic management of the tag sets such as by adding deleting or renaming tags. In exemplary embodiments the user or for a group domain the domain administrators or knowledge engineers could be responsible for creating the initial taxonomy or folksonomy for a tag set as well as any further management of the tag set after it has been created. In exemplary embodiments agent may be implemented to provide authorization procedures for controlling who may create and manipulate tag sets for various roles. The master tag set for the user s personal non group roles would be maintained in database and the master tag set for each group domain of which the user is a member can be maintained in a single separate database such as database .

In exemplary embodiments to ensure consistency of the sets of tags maintained for the user across each tag based application provided for in the SOA agent may be configured to synchronize the current taxonomy of each separate tag set that is maintained for the user with any prior tags the user had created to describe web content at the tag based application corresponding to that tag set. That is once the user is satisfied with the consistency of the set of tags that the user has created or modified for a specific role the tags could then be updated in a one way synchronization in all of the tag based applications provided for in the SOA with which the user was involved or as otherwise desired by the user. This would provide the user with a consistent set of tags for web content across all tag based applications of the SOA in that role and allow the use or other members of a group domain to for example make meaningful web feed queries to aggregate content across these applications.

In exemplary embodiments agent may perform synchronization operations by mining the tag sets of each of the tag based applications of which the agent is aware and then accessing each tag based application to update each prior tag created by the user in the specified role for objects or web content within that tag based application with the new tag set now maintained in one of the databases. In exemplary embodiments agent can perform this by first loading the new tag sets for each of the tag based applications for the user in the specified role then comparing the new tag set for each tag based application with each prior tag created by the user in the specified role at that tag based application and finally performing a one way synchronization of the tags from the tag sets maintained at the client side to each of the registered applications.

In exemplary embodiments agent can be also configured to configured to perform other synchronization operations on the user s tag set such as synchronizing separate tag sets maintained for separate user roles but corresponding to the same tag based application synchronizing a domain specific tag set with other tag sets for the user or with the tag sets of a group domain or CoP. In various exemplary embodiments agent may be configured to perform the synchronization periodically at regular intervals when initiated by the user or a domain expert or whenever the user logs in as a specific role or to one of the tag based services provided for in the SOA.

In exemplary embodiments the user may login to agent as and assume more than one specified role during a session. To enable a user to posts tags to tag based applications using multiple roles concurrently in a single session agent may perform role based session management on the client side by placing additional identifier metadata that specifies the actively tagging role for the user on the tags as they are published to tag based applications. The identifier metadata must be unique for each role to prevent occurrences of incidental collision with tags in other roles. Agent may do this for example by utilizing role identifying suffixes or prefixes in a manner similar to that of an XML Namespace. In this way two identically named tags from different tag sets may be made to be semantically different by specifying metadata that would differentiate the two tags according to role. In situations in which the identical tag term has been posted from the tag sets of distinct roles for the user for the same tag based application and would otherwise appear ambiguous to agent as to the user role under which it was posted by adding this specifying metadata to the tags as they are posted the agent will be able to correctly identify the role under which the user posted a tag by accessing this metadata.

As an example in a situation where the user logs in as the domain administrator for a CoP the user has access to domain specific tags that are particular to that CoP. To ensure that the available tags in this role do not conflict with any other tags in the user s other roles without requiring separate login sessions for the different roles in each tag based application agent could add metadata to the tags posted by the user so the tags are suffixed or prefixed with an identifier that is unique to a specific role.

Moreover in exemplary embodiments agent may place other metadata that specifies additional information on the tags as they are published to tag based applications. For example metadata specifying which tag based application a particular tag pertains the type of content that is tagged the owner of the content that is tagged tagging categories etc. may be encoded for each tag. In exemplary embodiments this could involve appending metadata to a tag or to a composite tag having role identifier metadata already appended with an identifier that is uniquely specified for the tag based application to which the tag is posted. In this way two identically named tags in different tag sets for the user can be made to be semantically different by specifying metadata that would differentiate them according to application.

In exemplary embodiments the additional metadata encoding or identifiers placed by agent on tags may be presented transparently to the user operating the agent so that the user will be able to identify and manage their tags according to role or other information specified by the metadata. In alternative exemplary embodiments agent may be configured such that any additional metadata encoding or identifiers are nontransparent when tags are presented to the user. In such embodiments the tag terminology will appear to the user without the additional information as it did when created but when agent posts or synchronizes these tags to the tag based applications specified in the SOA the agent may prefix or suffix these tags with metadata that specifies additional information.

In exemplary embodiments agent could also be configured to provide a user interface window or menu such as for example a dashboard to a user or CoP administrator to allow for monitoring and mining of data regarding the use of the tag sets across the various tag based applications to enable identification of trends and patterns. The user interface could be capable of for example performing various queries on tagging operations that have been performed for example data on the number of tags left by users how users use tags regularities in user activity tag frequencies kinds of tags used etc. . In exemplary embodiments this information could be used to dynamically create and modify aspects of the dashboard and or tag sets. For example the collected information could be used to refine tag set taxonomy to determine connections between related content or to rank content based upon its perceived utility based upon usage patterns.

In exemplary embodiments agent could also be configured to provide an applet or a user interface window to a user or group domain administrator that allows for clean up of any tag set inconsistencies or other aspects that may lead to unreliable tagging. Such inconsistencies may arise for example from polysemy the use of words that have multiple related meanings synonyms multiple words with the same or similar meanings and word inflections such as with plural forms . In exemplary embodiments agent may be configured to with a lemmatization engine or to perform word stemming.

In other exemplary embodiments agent could be configured to maintain a table of synonym tags for a particular tag and to provide the table to the user to allow the user to select a desired tag term to always use for the same or similar meanings. The synonym table could be useful for instance the aid in finding appropriate tags for updating finding particular content in one of the tag based applications or creating a new tag in a meaningful manner. The synonym table could be constructed and modified for example by the user or domain administrators in a CoP. In exemplary embodiments the synonym table could be constructed from scratch or alternatively agent could be implemented with an initial version that could be updated by the user domain administrators or automatically within the agent using a tool that would dynamically construct the synonym table. In exemplary embodiments the synonym table could be populated at runtime by inspection of tag relationships using predefined rules specified by for example an enterprise. In exemplary embodiments agent could be configured to be aware of the role of the user and to permit access to the synonym table based upon the role of the user such as whether the user is logged in in a domain administrator role for a CoP synonym table. In exemplary embodiments the synonym table could be configured to employ a counter to indicate or rank for a given set of synonyms which synonym is the best match based upon previous heuristics.

In exemplary embodiments agent may be utilized by a domain administrator based upon information collected in data queries to implement a collabulary for a CoP s tag sets. A collabulary may be defined as a common vocabulary used to categorize content and in particular one created in collaboration with classification experts to ensure relevance and consistency. A collabulary may be conceptualized as a compromise between a taxonomy and a folksonomy in which domain administrators collaborate with group members to create rich but more systematic content tagging systems. The compromise may result is a system that combines the benefits of folksonomies low entry costs a rich vocabulary that is broadly shared and comprehensible by the user base and the capacity to respond quickly to language change without the errors that inevitably arise in naive unsupervised folksonomies.

Exemplary embodiments may therefore be implemented as described above to enable a body of information to be increasingly easy to search discover and navigate over time using role based tag sets to label classify and retrieve content. Collaborative tagging in this manner may for example provide a simple way for users to group bookmarks together and then share these grouped links with colleagues. One employee may retrieve the groups of links saved by another employee through many different routes. A related group may also be delivered to another user at the point of need that is when they are looking for related information. Because the tag sets are user generated and therefore inexpensive to implement they may provide a low cost alternative to corporate taxonomies or controlled hierarchical vocabularies and exemplary embodiments may be used to extend tagging and social bookmarking into the business arena with the addition of project groups to allow users to collaborate across boundaries. Exemplary embodiments of the present invention may be implemented to provide functionality for tagging of both structured and unstructured content and thereby provide for easier managing of the capture storage security revision control retrieval distribution preservation and destruction of documents and content. Exemplary embodiments may therefore be implemented to enable an organization such as a business or governmental agency to more effectively meet business goals.
