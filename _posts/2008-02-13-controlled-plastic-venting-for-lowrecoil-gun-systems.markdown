This invention claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 889 562 filed 13 Feb. 2007 the entire file wrapper of which is incorporated by reference as if set forth at length herein.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by the United States Government for United States Government purposes.

This invention relates generally to the field of low recoil gun systems employing a delayed pressure release mechanism. More specifically it pertains to a delayed pressure release mechanism exhibiting a controlled plastically deforming adiabatic shear failure mechanism.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 460 446 which is incorporated herein by reference as if set forth at length is directed to a Sonic Rarefaction Wave Recoilless Gun System and issued on 8 Oct. 2002 to Eric L. Kathe and assigned to the assignee of the instant application. That patent describes a low recoil and low bore heat gun system that employs a delayed pressure release mechanism for fired propellant charges in the rear of a gun barrel. According to the patent a delayed pressure release of exhaust gases causes a sonic rarefaction along the length of the gun barrel bore to arrive at an exit end of the gun barrel at a predetermined time generally coincident with the fired projectile. As a result such a gun system exhibits lower recoil without an appreciable loss of projectile velocity.

As can be readily appreciated the delayed pressure release mechanism is a critical component of the Sonic Rarefaction Wave Recoilless Gun System and essential to its operation. As described in the Sonic Rarefaction Wave Recoilless Gun System patent the delayed pressure release mechanism comprises a physically heavy bulky and mechanically complex inertial breech.

An advance is made in the art according to the principles of the present invention directed to a pressure release mechanism for a sonic rarefaction wave type low recoil gun system employing controlled plastic deformation venting that exhibits adiabatic shear banding phenomena to effect the delayed pressure release.

In sharp contrast to the prior art a pressure release mechanism according to the present invention uses a controlled plastic deformation based venting exhibiting adiabatic shear banding that advantageously does not employ any inertial breech mechanisms having moving parts thereby saving space weight and complexity.

Instead in an exemplary embodiment a pressure release mechanism according to the present invention allows the rear face of a round itself to vent in a controlled and deliberate manner. Advantageously since the pressure release mechanism is a combination of structural round design and material selection coupled with a high energy material failure mechanism each round can be designed for any particular chamber geometry and peak pressure. Since the mechanically complex and heavy inertial breech mechanism is eliminated a low recoil gun system employing the present invention may advantageously be fired from a shoulder or other lightweight emplacement.

Additionally a pressure release mechanism according to the present invention which employs adiabatic shear banding plasticity to effect the venting is scalable to any caliber gun system and adaptable to any given design criteria including caliber chamber pressure chamber profile and burn profile s of a given propellant.

Finally a pressure release mechanism according to the present invention vents after the system reaches a peak pressure and therefore allows the use of a variety of materials for its implementation.

The following merely illustrates the principles of the invention. It will thus be appreciated that those skilled in the art will be able to devise various arrangements which although not explicitly described or shown herein embody the principles of the invention and are included within its spirit and scope.

Furthermore all examples and conditional language recited herein are principally intended expressly to be only for pedagogical purposes to aid the reader in understanding the principles of the invention and the concepts contributed by the inventor s to furthering the art and are to be construed as being without limitation to such specifically recited examples and conditions.

Moreover all statements herein reciting principles aspects and embodiments of the invention as well as specific examples thereof are intended to encompass both structural and functional equivalents thereof. Additionally it is intended that such equivalents include both currently known equivalents as well as equivalents developed in the future i.e. any elements developed that perform the same function regardless of structure.

For the purposes of this discussion the barrel may be viewed as having a forward end which terminates at an open muzzle and a rear or breech end . Shown within the breech end is an integrated breech vent nozzle through which internal pressure s will be vented during operation.

Shown positioned within the barrel is a self venting round generally comprising a cylindrical casing with a projectile inserted into one end of the casing and a sever disk inserted or otherwise positioned at another end of the casing so as to form a closed cylinder round . Loaded into the casing is a propellant charge .

As should be apparent to those skilled in the art when the round is discharged the rapidly burning propellant will generate a quantity of expanding gases which in turn propel the projectile along the barrel towards its forward end until it exits the open muzzle .

As the propellant burns resulting in the translation of the projectile along the central axis or bore of the barrel the pressure resulting from the burning propellant builds. In a conventional closed breech gun system the pressure will reach a maximum and is then reduced to atmospheric pressure upon projectile exiting from the muzzle .

The maximum rarefaction wave phenomena recoil mitigation results when the breech of the gun system is vented approximately 10 after peak pressure and the resulting rarefaction wave meets the projectile at muzzle exit . Consequently maximum venting time past peak pressure and associated recoil mitigation are realized while not diminishing the kinetic energy of the projectile.

According to the present invention the sever disk will undergo an adiabatic shear band plastic deformation which will vent the gun system at an appropriate time. Significantly and according to an aspect of the present invention the adiabatic shear band produced in the sever disk will survive the peak pressure of the chamber and fail after peak pressure thereby supporting a proper rarefaction delay.

Turning now to . E there is shown a series of diagrams which generally depict the operation of the present invention. With simultaneous reference to those figures it may be seen in that burning propellant produces an expanding gas which as in a closed breech firing causes a chamber pressure within the barrel to build behind the projectile .

Due to the expanding gas the projectile is translated along the bore of the barrel towards the muzzle . As a result of the internal pressure and heat generated and strain rate the sever disk begins to initiate controlled complex plastic deformation due to the generated heat which cannot diffuse. The sever disk begins to undergo controlled dynamic plastic deformation as the pressure increases.

At maximum pressure FIG. C the projectile has translated along the bore of the barrel . Although the pressure is still contained adiabatic shear band is initiated within the sever disk .

In peak pressure has already occurred and the projectile has translated along a substantial length of the bore of the barrel . As the internal pressure continues dropping the controlled adiabatic shear band propagates within sever disk allowing venting after the peak pressure is reached within barrel. While not specifically shown in great detail in this a rarefaction wave is created upon venting. The rarefaction wave moving faster than the propellant gases propelling the projectile chases the projectile down the bore of the barrel .

As the projectile reaches the muzzle of the barrel shear band induced catastrophic load bearing capacity collapse of the sever disk permits complete venting of gases which are shown in as venting through integral breech nozzle. As can be now appreciated the rarefaction wave has met the projectile at muzzle exit which maximizes the rarefaction wave recoil mitigation benefits and the recoil of the gun system is appreciably reduced.

More particularly the particular sever disk in was purchased according to ASTM B221 standard for aerospace grade 6061 T651 aluminum. The material was Aluminum extruded rod 3 diameter stock. As received the material exhibited a Yield stress property of 42.5K psi and an ultimate tensile strength property of 48.3 Kpsi. A standard ASTM tensile strength specimen was created to verify these. As those skilled in the art may already be aware there are minimum strength values for such material certifications but no specified upper limits. Accordingly a tensile test and a shear test were undertaken which showed that the material purchased was above the designed value of 35 000 psi for yield stress and the corresponding shear strength . The materials were annealed to a value of 35 000 psi by a custom annealing process comprising submitting in a HOMO 3 Furnace at 175 C. 374 F. for approximately 100 hours.

Dimensionally the exemplary sever disk shown in may be understood by the following relationships. For a disk substantially 15.2 mm thick if it is given that the notch to notch thickness as parameter A 6.5 mm then the lower curved radius must be approximately 0.54 A. The bottom notch depth must be approximately 0.83 A about s A . The offset of the top notch to the bottom notch radial offset is approximately 0.385 A about s A .

As already noted such a sever disk will advantageously vent a gun system after peak pressure has been reached in the barrel. That is to say peak pressure is reached it begins to fall and then sometime after peak pressure begins to fall the sever disk will plastically fail due to adiabatic shear banding thereby venting the pressurized barrel to the atmosphere. When performed in this manner the recoil is advantageously reduced

Of further advantage the present invention may be used to arrest or otherwise mitigate rotational momentum associated with the firing of a gun system. With reference now to there is shown a cross section of a gun system A and a breech end view of that same gun system. As can be appreciated for a rifled gun system the spinning projectile imparts a substantial rotational momentum to the gun barrel upon firing. To counteract this rotational momentum a series of directed jets or nozzles are disposed around the perimeter of the breech. Upon firing the sever disk will vent some of the pressure within the barrel through the nozzles . When the nozzles are angled sufficiently the gases vented through the nozzles will itself impart a rotational momentum to the barrel which may advantageously be directed to counteract that momentum imparted by the spinning projectile. The number shape and size of the nozzles may advantageously be varied such that a desirable amount of counteraction is imparted.

At this point while we have discussed and described the invention using some specific examples those skilled in the art will recognize that our teachings are not so limited. For example the preferred embodiments of the invention have been provided for the purpose of explaining the principles of the invention and its practical application thereby enabling others skilled in the art to understand the invention. Various embodiments and various modifications are contemplated. Accordingly the invention should be only limited by the scope of the claims attached hereto.
