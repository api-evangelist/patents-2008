abstract: A gas turbine engine centrifugal compressor axial forward thrust apparatus bleeds impeller tip aft bleed flow from between an annular centrifugal compressor impeller of a high pressure rotor and a diffuser directly downstream of the impeller. The apparatus then uses the aft bleed flow to pressurize an annular cavity extending radially between an inner combustor casing and the rotor and extending axially between forward and aft thrust balance seals. Forward and aft thrust balance lands are in sealing engagement with the forward and aft thrust balance seals on the high pressure rotor respectively. An annular stator plenum in fluid communication with the annular cavity is bounded in part by a forward end wall having conical diffusion holes therethrough which may be axially or circumferentially or axially and circumferentially angled. The forward thrust balance seal may be on an aft conical arm of the impeller.

The present invention relates generally to gas turbine engines having centrifugal compressors and more specifically maintaining forward thrust on a centrifugal compressor impeller.

Positive forward rotor thrust is critical to the operation of a centrifugal compressor gas turbine engine. Maintaining a positive forward thrust on the impeller or rotor thrust as it is often referred to helps minimize the clearances between the shroud and blades of the impeller. Minimizing these clearances increases fuel efficiency and is often useful or necessary to satisfy required fuel efficiency specifications. Additionally sufficiently small clearances must be maintained between the shroud and blades of the impeller in order to minimize losses between the tips of the blades and the shroud and to maintain sufficient stall margin. It is also important to avoid the rotor thrust to crossing over into the negative rotor thrust regime which could damage the engine. The resulting deflection of the overall rotor including the rotating hardware in the gas generator turbine where tight clearances are maintained could result in a damaging rub between rotating and stator hardware.

It is known in the art to minimize clearance between the blade tips of an impeller rotating within a gas turbine engine and a surrounding blade tip shroud to reduce leakage of a working fluid around the blade tips of centrifugal compressor stages. It is known that rotor thrust may be controlled by proper design of an inner radius of a swirl plate along an impeller backwall which has only limited forward rotor thrust capability. A radial static pressure gradient along the impeller backwall exists as a result of windage losses between the rotor and stator. The precise design of the swirl plate inner radius results in a specific static pressure and piston area in which the impeller backwall bleed area provides forward pressure on the impeller thus positive forward rotor thrust.

It is known that increasing the inner radius of the swirl plate results in less windage losses and higher air static pressure in the cavity aft of the impeller as well as increased piston area aft of the impeller and thus increased forward rotor thrust. However with this configuration there exists a practical limit on how much forward rotor thrust can be achieved due to the limitations on how high the inner radius of the swirl plate can be designed. This capability of increasing forward rotor thrust by increasing the swirl plate inner radius is even more limited in the case where clean air from the impeller is used for turbine cooling since a windage shield would be necessary between the rotor and static inner combustor case.

Conventional engines employ clean air bleed systems to cool turbine components in gas turbines using an axi centrifugal compressor as is done in the General Electric CFE738 engine. The turbine cooling supply air exits the centrifugal diffuser through a small gap between the diffuser exit and deswirler inner shroud. This air is then ducted radially inward by expensive integrally cast passages to the inside of the inner combustion case where it is then ducted into an accelerator via an arduous path where the airflow must make several 90 degree turns generating losses and thus raising the temperature of the cooling air before going through the accelerator. After leaving the accelerator this cooling air travels up along a stage 1 turbine disk into a stage 1 turbine blade.

Thus there continues to be a demand for advancements in impeller or rotor positive thrust control to maintain proper impeller blade tip clearance technology and provide efficient turbine cooling air from the impeller.

A gas turbine engine centrifugal compressor axial forward thrust apparatus includes an annular centrifugal compressor impeller of a high pressure rotor an impeller bleed means for bleeding impeller tip aft bleed flow from between the impeller and a diffuser directly downstream of the impeller and a pressurizing means for using the aft bleed flow to pressurize an annular cavity extending radially between an inner combustor casing and the high pressure rotor and extending axially between forward and aft thrust balance seals.

An exemplary embodiment of the apparatus includes an annular stator plenum in fluid communication with the annular cavity is bounded in part by a forward end wall and the pressurizing means includes conical diffusion holes in the forward end wall. The conical diffusion holes may be axially or circumferentially or axially and circumferentially angled. The apparatus may further include metering holes which may be circumferentially angled in the inner combustor casing between the annular stator plenum and the annular cavity. Forward and aft thrust balance lands are in sealing engagement with the forward and aft thrust balance seals on the high pressure rotor respectively. The forward thrust balance seal may be located on an aft conical arm of the impeller of the rotor.

The gas turbine engine centrifugal compressor axial forward thrust apparatus may be incorporated in a gas turbine engine assembly including a combustor between a high pressure compressor and a high pressure turbine. An exemplary embodiment of the assembly further includes an annular combustor stator assembly having a forward end wall extending radially outwardly from and joined to the inner combustor casing a radially outer portion of the forward end wall being an aft wall of the diffuser a stator plenum disposed between and in fluid communication with the impeller and the annular cavity and the stator plenum being in part bounded by a radially inner portion of the forward end wall and an annular cover spaced axially aftwardly of the radially inner portion of the forward end wall.

A cooling air bleed means for bleeding clean cooling air from a bleed location downstream of an outlet of the diffuser is in fluid communication with one or more cooling air channels having generally radially extending sections followed by generally axially aftwardly extending sections. The one or more channels are in fluid communication with an annular cooling air plenum having one or more accelerators. The cooling air bleed means includes an annular manifold in fluid communication with a bleed location downstream of an outlet of the diffuser where compressor discharge pressure air enters a deswirl cascade along an internal radius portion.

Each of the cooling air channels includes a channel inner wall formed and running along a radially outer portion of the forward end wall the annular cover and the inner combustor casing. The channel inner wall includes a generally radially extending radial wall section connected to a generally axially aftwardly extending axial wall section by a curved wall section. Circumferentially spaced apart channel side walls extend outwardly from the channel inner wall and a channel outer wall is spaced outwardly from the channel inner wall and attached to the channel side walls. Each of the cooling air channels terminate at an aft conical section of the inner combustor casing between the annular cooling air plenum and the cooling air channels and cooling air apertures are disposed through the aft conical section.

Illustrated in gas turbine engine with a high pressure gas generator having a single stage centrifugal compressor as a final compressor stage and an axial forward thrust apparatus for maintaining a forward thrust on the high pressure rotor for helping to maintain or control clearances or gaps between the high pressure rotor and stator throughout the high pressure gas generator . Further referring to the high pressure gas generator has a high pressure rotor including in downstream flow relationship a high pressure compressor a combustor and a high pressure turbine . The rotor is rotatably supported about an engine centerline by a forward bearing in a front frame and a rear bearing disposed downstream of high pressure turbine in a turbine frame .

The exemplary embodiment of the compressor illustrated herein includes a five stage axial compressor followed by the single stage centrifugal compressor having an annular centrifugal compressor impeller . Outlet guide vanes are disposed between the five stage axial compressor and the single stage centrifugal compressor . Further referring to compressor discharge pressure CDP air exits the impeller and passes through a diffuser and then through a deswirl cascade into a combustion chamber within the combustor . The combustion chamber is surrounded by annular radially outer and inner combustor casings . Air is conventionally mixed with fuel provided by a plurality of fuel nozzles and ignited and combusted in an annular combustion zone bounded by annular radially outer and inner combustion liners .

The combustion produces hot combustion gases which flow through the high pressure turbine causing rotation of the high pressure rotor and continue downstream for further work extraction in a low pressure turbine and final exhaust as is conventionally known. In the exemplary embodiment depicted herein the high pressure turbine includes in downstream serial flow relationship first and second high pressure turbine stages having first and second stage disks . A high pressure shaft of the high pressure rotor connects the high pressure turbine in rotational driving engagement to the impeller . A first stage nozzle is directly upstream of the first high pressure turbine stage and a second stage nozzle is directly upstream of the second high pressure turbine stage. An annular cavity is radially disposed between the inner combustor casing and the high pressure shaft of the high pressure rotor .

Referring to the compressor discharge pressure CDP air is discharged from the impeller of the centrifugal compressor and used to combust fuel in the combustor and to cool components of turbine subjected to the hot combustion gases namely the first stage nozzle a first stage shroud and the first stage disk . The compressor includes a forward casing and an aft casing as more fully illustrated in . The forward casing generally surrounds the axial compressor and the aft casing generally surrounds the centrifugal compressor and supports the diffuser directly downstream of the centrifugal compressor . The compressor discharge pressure CDP air is discharged from the impeller of the centrifugal compressor directly into the diffuser .

Referring to and the impeller includes a plurality of centrifugal compressor blades radially extending from rotor disc portion . Opposite and axially forward of the compressor blades is an annular blade tip shroud . The shroud is adjacent to blade tips of the compressor blades defining an annular blade tip clearance therebetween. The blade tip clearance varies in axial width W in a radial direction R as measured from the engine centerline . It is desirable to minimize the blade tip clearance during the engine operating cycle and avoid or minimize rubs between the shroud and the blade tips of the compressor blades particularly during engine accelerations such as during cold bursts.

It is known to provide sufficient forward rotor thrust to properly operate the impeller in order to minimize the blade tip clearance during the engine operating cycle in general to maintain or control clearances between the high pressure rotor and stator throughout the high pressure gas generator . The forward thrust apparatus is designed to provide this forward rotor thrust and is illustrated in more detail in .

Referring to an annular combustor stator assembly includes an annular radially extending forward end wall extending radially outwardly from and joined to the inner combustor casing by an annular bend . The exemplary annular combustor stator assembly illustrated herein is a unitary one piece element made from a single or one piece casting. A radially outer portion of the forward end wall forms an aft wall of the diffuser . An impeller bleed means for bleeding impeller tip aft bleed flow from between the impeller and the diffuser and flow the aft bleed flow into an annular stator plenum of the annular combustor stator assembly as illustrated in greater detail in . The stator plenum is bounded by a radially inner portion of the forward end wall and an annular cover further illustrated in . The annular cover includes a cover aft wall having a planar annular wall section followed by a conical wall section . The annular cover is attached to the forward end wall and the inner combustor casing and may be made of sheet metal.

The impeller tip aft bleed flow is diffused through a circumferentially arrayed plurality of conical diffusion holes in the inner portion of the forward end wall as further illustrtaed in . The conical diffusion holes are illustrated herein as being conical but may be otherwise shaped. The conical diffusion holes are also illustrated herein as being axially or circumferentially or axially and circumferentially angled which provides longer holes for a greater amount of diffusion with lower airflow losses through the holes.

Referring more specifically to the annular cavity which is radially disposed between the inner combustor casing and the high pressure shaft of the high pressure rotor is axially sealed by forward and aft thrust balance seals . Note that the annular cover is attached to the inner combustor casing aft of the forward thrust balance seal . The forward thrust balance seal is located on a radially outer surface of an aft conical arm of the impeller of the rotor immediately aft of an impeller bore of the impeller . The forward thrust balance seal seals against a forward thrust balance land mounted on a radially inner surface of the inner combustor casing . The aft thrust balance seal is located on the radially outer surface of the high pressure shaft of the rotor and seals against an aft thrust balance land mounted to and extends radially outwardly of a plenum casing used for cooling the high pressure turbine . Incorporating the rotating forward thrust balance seal directly on the impeller of the rotor provides a more efficient stator architecture design allows for a low loss clean air bleed circuit to cool the turbine.

High pressure air in the stator plenum is created by diffusing the impeller tip aft bleed flow through the conical diffusion holes in the inner portion of the forward end wall . The high pressure air in the stator plenum is metered by precisely sized angled metering holes in the inner combustor casing also illustrated in to flow into the annular cavity which provides a positive axial thrust in the forward direction F on the impeller . This relatively higher static pressure air in the stator plenum pressurizes the annular cavity between the inner combustor casing and the high pressure shaft of the high pressure rotor the stator and the rotor and between the forward and aft thrust balance seals which pushes the impeller forward to provide the necessary amount of forward rotor thrust.

Referring to the design of the size of the angled metering holes is used to precisely control the amount of forward rotor thrust. The metering holes are circumferentially angled. Bleeding air through the conical diffusion holes in the inner portion of the forward end wall increases the amount of impeller tip aft bleed flow and enables the impeller tip aft bleed flow to achieve an empirically derived optimal amount of the impeller tip aft bleed flow rate which in turn increases centrifugal compressor efficiency.

A turbine cooling system with very low turning losses is illustrated in . The turbine cooling system is used to cool high pressure turbine HPT first stage blades of the first stage disk with clean cooling air in order to minimize sand and or dirt ingested into HPT blade cooling passages and thus prevent blocking of the small blade cooling passages and consequent blade failure. The clean cooling air is bled at a bleed location downstream of an outlet of the diffuser as the CDP air enters the deswirl cascade along an internal radius portion thereof. The clean cooling air bled in this manner is substantially free of particulate matter which could clog fine cooling passages in the first stage blades of the first stage disk .

Referring to the clean cooling air is bled into and collected in an annular manifold and flowed radially inwardly through at least one or more cooling air channels . The exemplary embodiment of the turbine cooling system illustrated herein includes two cooling air channels . Each of the cooling air channels has a channel inner wall formed and running along a radially outer portion of the forward end wall the annular cover and the inner combustor casing . The channel inner wall includes a generally radially extending radial wall section connected to a generally axially aftwardly extending axial wall section by a curved wall section .

Circumferentially spaced apart channel side walls extend outwardly from the channel inner wall . A channel outer wall spaced outwardly from the channel inner wall is attached to the channel side walls thus sealing the cooling air channel . The channel inner and outer walls may be made from sheet metal. The cooling air channel terminates at an aft conical section of the inner combustor casing . The cooling air channel thus includes a generally radially extending section followed by a generally axially aftwardly extending section which terminates at the aft conical section . A bend section of the cooling air channel connects the generally radially extending section to the generally axially aftwardly extending section . The generally axially aftwardly extending section is slightly angled radially inwardly going from the bend section to the aft conical section and the cooling air plenum . This provides a substantially straight flowpath for the clean cooling air with a minimal amount of flow turning losses through the combustor . This provides cooling passages for the clean cooling air that run along along the radially outer portion of the forward end wall the annular cover and the inner combustor casing . The cooling passages provide a straight through uninterrupted flowpath through the combustor with no turning losses.

Cooling air apertures in the aft conical section allow the clean cooling air to flow directly into an annular cooling air plenum within the plenum casing . The clean cooling air is accelerated by a one or more accelerators attached to the plenum casing at an aft end of the cooling air plenum . The channels terminate at and are in fluid communication with the annular cooling air plenum which is in fluid supply communication with the one or more accelerators . The accelerators inject the clean cooling air into a stage one disk forward cavity at a high tangential speed approaching wheel speed of the first stage disk at a radial position of the accelerator . The clean cooling air then flows through and cools the stage disk and the first stage blades . The cooling air channels terminating at the aft conical section directly bounding the cooling air plenum helps to provide a substantially straight flowpath for the clean cooling air with a minimal amount of flow turning losses through the combustor .
