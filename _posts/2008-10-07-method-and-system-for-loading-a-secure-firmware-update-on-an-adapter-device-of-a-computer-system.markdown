title: Method and system for loading a secure firmware update on an adapter device of a computer system
abstract: One embodiment of the present invention sets forth a method for loading a secure firmware update onto an adapter device in a computer system. The method includes the steps of sending a duplet of encrypted data conveying a same portion of an encrypted update image along a transfer path to the adapter device, restoring two portions of source data from the duplet, and determining whether to accept the source data based on the result of a comparison of the two portions of source data.

Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to adapter devices incorporated in computer devices and more specifically to methods and systems for loading a secure firmware update on an adapter device of a computer system.

Because the use of high definition HD digital content becomes more popular an increasing number of commercialized computer devices incorporate graphics processing systems that are compatible with the High Definition Multimedia Interface HDMI for transmitting HD digital content to a HDMI compatible display device. Conventionally in order to be compatible with the HDMI the graphics processing system is coupled to a specific adapter device i.e. an encoder chip via an Inter Integrated Circuit IC serial interface. The encoder chip is configured to convert the pixel data from the graphics processing system into the Transition Minimized Differential Signaling TMDS format for transmission over the HDMI. The tasks performed by this encoder chip are usually programmed in a firmware stored in a memory embedded on the encoder chip.

As the HDMI standard evolves updates of the encoder firmware may be released from the encoder manufacturer to enable the encoder to support upgraded versions of the HDMI standard. However because the firmware update includes proprietary contents it is important that the firmware update does not become exposed when it is loaded via the IC interface onto the encoder. Such exposure of the firmware update during its loading may not only facilitate unauthorized replications or misuses of the firmware update but also render content protection implemented on the encoder vulnerable to attacks by a hacker.

As the foregoing illustrates what is needed in the art is thus a system and method that are able to load a firmware update on an adapter device of a computer system in a confidential and secure manner and address at least the foregoing issues.

One embodiment of the present invention sets forth a method for loading a secure firmware update onto an adapter device in a computer system. The method includes the steps of sending a duplet of encrypted data conveying a same portion of an encrypted update image along a transfer path to the adapter device restoring two portions of source data from the duplet and determining whether to accept the source data based on the result of a comparison of the two portions of source data.

By using encrypted duplets to load the firmware update on the adapter device one advantage of the disclosed method and system is that unwanted accesses to the sensitive content of the firmware on the encoder can be prevented in an efficient manner.

The present application describes methods and systems for loading a secure firmware update on an adapter device of a target computer system. The firmware update for the adapter device is released as a software update package that includes an encrypted update image and an upload utility. The encrypted update image contains duplets of encrypted data obtained by encrypting twice each source data of the source firmware update. During execution the upload tool extracts the encrypted update image and sends each duplet through a secure transfer path to the adapter device. Because the encryption of each duplet used confidential keys and information specific to only approved computer systems the encrypted duplet cannot be successfully decrypted on unauthorized computer systems. Impermissible misuses of the firmware update on unauthorized computer systems are thus prevented.

During execution on a target computer system the upload utility extracts the encrypted update image and the identifier information SVID and SID and loads the encrypted update image byte by byte through a secure transfer path to the adapter device to update. At a point on the secure transfer path the two source bytes of each duplet are restored and compared to verify that the currently transferred byte comes from a trustable source and has not been tampered. As a result the duplet encryption scheme allows to maintain confidentiality of the update source program and prevents impermissible replications or reuses in replay attacks.

In response to instructions transmitted by the CPU the graphics adapter is configured to process graphics and or audio data. In one embodiment the graphics adapter comprises a graphics processing unit GPU that is coupled to a local memory and an adapter device such as encoder . The local memory store program instructions and graphics data processed by the GPU to render images for presentation on a display device . The encoder is coupled to the GPU via a serial bus such as an Inter Integrated Circuit IC interface . The encoder is a microcontroller chip that includes its own local memory . The memory stores a firmware that is executable on the encoder to perform encoding on pixel data provided by the GPU . In one embodiment the encoder may be configured to convert pixel data provided by the GPU into a Transition Minimized Differential Signaling TMDS format for transmission over a High Definition Multimedia Interface HDMI to the display device . In other embodiments the encoder may also be configured to implement the High Bandwidth Digital Content Protection HDCP protocol to transmit secure premium content through the HDMI to the display device . Because the firmware contains sensitive content it is desirable that updates of the firmware are loaded on the encoder in a confidential and secure manner.

Referring to again the system memory contains an operating system OS a graphics driver and a firmware update package . In one embodiment the firmware update package is used to update the firmware of the encoder . The firmware update package includes an upload utility program and an encrypted update image . The upload utility program is configured to extract the encrypted update image apply verification tests on the encrypted update image and the computer system and call functions of an application programming interface API in the OS to have the graphics driver load the encrypted update image along a secure transfer path to the encoder . The encrypted update image includes duplets of encrypted bytes generated by encrypting twice each byte of the firmware update source program such as previously described in conjunction with . As the encrypted update image is being loaded onto the encoder the two source data bytes of each duplet are decrypted and compared to verify the integrity of the encrypted update image .

By loading the firmware update in the form of encrypted duplets the secure transfer path can prevent direct access to the sensitive content of the firmware on the encoder . It is worth noting that while the foregoing embodiments have the duplet decryption step performed by the graphics driver alternate embodiments described below may also have the decryption step performed on the encoder.

In this embodiment the method steps performed by the upload utility are substantially the same as those of the previously described upload utility . Furthermore the graphics driver is configured to simply pass the duplets sent out by the upload utility to the encoder without performing any decryption steps. The decryption and verification of the duplets are performed on the encoder provided with the adequate decryption cipher .

By using encrypted duplets to load the firmware update on the encoder the transfer path can be secured against direct access to the sensitive content of the firmware on the encoder. Furthermore because the encryption scheme applied on the duplets uses identification information specific to authorized target computers impermissible uses of the firmware update on unauthorized systems can thus be prevented.

While the forgoing is directed to embodiments of the present invention other and further embodiments of the invention may be devised without departing from the basic scope thereof. For example aspects of the present invention may be implemented in hardware or software or in a combination of hardware and software. One embodiment of the invention may be implemented as a program product for use with a computer system.
