title: Data placement technique for striping data containers across volumes of a storage system cluster
abstract: A technique places content, such as data, of one or more data containers on volumes of a striped volume set (SVS). The placement of data across the volumes of the SVS allows specification of a deterministic pattern of fixed length. That is, the pattern determines a placement of data of a data container that is striped among the volumes of the SVS. The placement pattern is such that the stripes are distributed exactly or nearly equally among the volumes and that, within any local span of a small multiple of the number of volumes, the stripes are distributed nearly equally among the volumes. The placement pattern is also substantially similar for a plurality of SVSs having different numbers of volumes.

The present application is also related to U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 11 119 118 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR RESTRIPING DATA ACROSS A PLURALITY OF VOLUMES by Richard Jernigan Patent Publication No. 2006 0248379 and 11 119 278 entitled STORAGE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE FOR STRIPING DATA CONTAINER CONTENT ACROSS VOLUMES OF A CLUSTER by Richard Jernigan et al. Patent Publication No. 2005 0192932 the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

The present invention relates to storage systems and more specifically to the placement of data across a plurality of volumes in a storage system.

A storage system typically comprises one or more storage devices into which information may be entered and from which information may be obtained as desired. The storage system includes a storage operating system that functionally organizes the system by inter alia invoking storage operations in support of a storage service implemented by the system. The storage system may be implemented in accordance with a variety of storage architectures including but not limited to a network attached storage environment a storage area network and a disk assembly directly attached to a client or host computer. The storage devices are typically disk drives organized as a disk array wherein the term disk commonly describes a self contained rotating magnetic media storage device. The term disk in this context is synonymous with hard disk drive HDD or direct access storage device DASD .

The storage operating system of the storage system may implement a high level module such as a file system to logically organize the information stored on volumes as a hierarchical structure of data containers such as files and logical unit numbers luns . For example each on disk file may be implemented as set of data structures i.e. disk blocks configured to store information such as the actual data for the file. These data blocks are organized within a volume block number vbn space that is maintained by the file system. The file system may also assign each data block in the file a corresponding file offset or file block number fbn . The file system typically assigns sequences of fbns on a per file basis whereas vbns are assigned over a larger volume address space. The file system organizes the data blocks within the vbn space as a logical volume each logical volume may be although is not necessarily associated with its own file system.

A known type of file system is a write anywhere file system that does not overwrite data on disks. If a data block is retrieved read from disk into a memory of the storage system and dirtied i.e. updated or modified with new data the data block is thereafter stored written to a new location on disk to optimize write performance. A write anywhere file system may initially assume an optimal layout such that the data is substantially contiguously arranged on disks. The optimal disk layout results in efficient access operations particularly for sequential read operations directed to the disks. An example of a write anywhere file system that is configured to operate on a storage system is the Write Anywhere File Layout WAFL file system available from Network Appliance Inc. Sunnyvale Calif.

The storage system may be further configured to operate according to a client server model of information delivery to thereby allow many clients to access data containers stored on the system. In this model the client may comprise an application such as a database application executing on a computer that connects to the storage system over a computer network such as a point to point link shared local area network LAN wide area network WAN or virtual private network VPN implemented over a public network such as the Internet. Each client may request the services of the storage system by issuing file based and block based protocol messages in the form of packets to the system over the network.

A plurality of storage systems may be interconnected to provide a storage system environment configured to service many clients. Each storage system may be configured to service one or more volumes wherein each volume stores one or more data containers. Yet often a large number of data access requests issued by the clients may be directed to a small number of data containers serviced by a particular storage system of the environment. A solution to such a problem is to distribute the volumes serviced by the particular storage system among all of the storage systems of the environment. This in turn distributes the data access requests along with the processing resources needed to service such requests among all of the storage systems thereby reducing the individual processing load on each storage system. However a noted disadvantage arises when only a single data container such as a file is heavily accessed by clients of the storage system environment. As a result the storage system attempting to service the requests directed to that data container may exceed its processing resources and become overburdened with a concomitant degradation of speed and performance.

One technique for overcoming the disadvantages of having a single data container such as a file that is heavily utilized is to stripe the data container across a plurality of volumes configured as a striped volume set SVS where each volume is serviced by a different storage system thereby distributing the load for the single data container among a plurality of storage systems. An example of such a data container striping technique is described in the above referenced U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005 0192932 entitled STORAGE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE FOR STRIPING DATA CONTAINER CONTENT ACROSS VOLUMES OF A CLUSTER. Here stripes of content data of a data container are allocated in round robin order to each volume of the SVS in sequence wrapping around to a first volume when a last volume of the SVS is reached. This data container striping technique achieves exact or near exact balance of data across the volumes of the SVS.

However a noted disadvantage of such a data container striping technique arises when the number of volumes within a SVS changes. For example if a new volume is added to or an existing volume is removed from the SVS nearly all the stripes will have to move to a different volume to restore balance e.g. via a re striping operation among all the volumes. Addition or removal of a volume from a SVS configured to implement round robin striping is an input output I O intensive and time consuming operation that is expensive in terms of performance and duration of the re striping operation. Yet restriping is an important feature as it allows users and administrators to adjust the allocation of storage and processor resources to data containers by adding or removing storage systems or storage units from a pool of storage systems or units used for the data containers.

The present invention overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art by providing a technique for placing content such as data of one or more data containers on volumes of a striped volume set SVS . The SVS is associated with a set of striping rules that define a stripe algorithm a stripe width and an ordered list of volumes distributed across a plurality of nodes interconnected as a cluster. The stripe algorithm specifies the manner in which the data is apportioned as stripes across the volumes while the stripe width specifies the size width of each stripe. Notably the data placement technique selects a volume within which to place a stripe such that all stripes are apportioned among the volumes of the SVS in a manner that improves the efficiency of storage service provided by the cluster.

According to a first aspect of the invention the placement of data across the volumes of the SVS allows specification of a deterministic pattern of fixed length. That is the pattern determines a placement of data of a data container such as a file that is striped among the volumes of the SVS. The placement pattern is such that the stripes are distributed exactly or nearly equally among the volumes and that within any local span of a small multiple of the number of volumes the stripes are distributed nearly equally among the volumes.

According to a second aspect of the invention the placement pattern is substantially similar for a plurality of SVSs having different numbers of volumes. For example assume one or more volumes are added to existing volumes of a SVS and that stripes on the existing volumes are redistributed among the additional volumes. This aspect of the invention enables re striping of the data by moving a minimum number of stripes while retaining a property of balance across the new number of volumes in the SVS. In general adding an Nth volume to a SVS having N 1 volumes requires moving 1 N of the existing stripes from each of the pre existing N 1 volumes to the added Nth volume.

Advantageously the data placement technique minimizes the number of stripes that have to move for any change in the number of volumes of the SVS while retaining a property that the data is balanced or nearly balanced across those volumes. The novel technique also minimizes the cost of a re striping operation while potentially substantially reducing the duration of such an operation. Moreover the novel data placement technique maintains data balance after re striping.

The clients may be general purpose computers configured to interact with the node in accordance with a client server model of information delivery. That is each client may request the services of the node and the node may return the results of the services requested by the client by exchanging packets over the network . The client may issue packets including file based access protocols such as the Common Internet File System CIFS protocol or Network File System NFS protocol over the Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol TCP IP when accessing information in the form of files and directories. Alternatively the client may issue packets including block based access protocols such as the Small Computer Systems Interface SCSI protocol encapsulated over TCP iSCSI and SCSI encapsulated over Fibre Channel FCP when accessing information in the form of blocks.

Each node is illustratively embodied as a dual processor storage system executing a storage operating system that preferably implements a high level module such as a file system to logically organize the information as a hierarchical structure of named data containers such as directories files and special types of files called virtual disks hereinafter generally blocks on the disks. However it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that the node may alternatively comprise a single or more than two processor system. Illustratively one processor executes the functions of the N blade on the node while the other processor executes the functions of the D blade .

The memory illustratively comprises storage locations that are addressable by the processors and adapters for storing software program code and data structures associated with the present invention. The processor and adapters may in turn comprise processing elements and or logic circuitry configured to execute the software code and manipulate the data structures. The storage operating system portions of which is typically resident in memory and executed by the processing elements functionally organizes the node by inter alia invoking storage operations in support of the storage service implemented by the node. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that other processing and memory means including various computer readable media may be used for storing and executing program instructions pertaining to the invention described herein.

The network adapter comprises a plurality of ports adapted to couple the node to one or more clients over point to point links wide area networks virtual private networks implemented over a public network Internet or a shared local area network. The network adapter thus may comprise the mechanical electrical and signaling circuitry needed to connect the node to the network. Illustratively the computer network may be embodied as an Ethernet network or a Fibre Channel FC network. Each client may communicate with the node over network by exchanging discrete frames or packets of data according to pre defined protocols such as TCP IP.

The storage adapter cooperates with the storage operating system executing on the node to access information requested by the clients. The information may be stored on any type of attached array of writable storage device media such as video tape optical DVD magnetic tape bubble memory electronic random access memory micro electro mechanical and any other similar media adapted to store information including data and parity information. However as illustratively described herein the information is preferably stored on the disks of array . The storage adapter comprises a plurality of ports having input output I O interface circuitry that couples to the disks over an I O interconnect arrangement such as a conventional high performance FC link topology.

Storage of information on each array is preferably implemented as one or more storage volumes that comprise a collection of physical storage disks cooperating to define an overall logical arrangement of volume block number vbn space on the volume s . Each logical volume is generally although not necessarily associated with its own file system. The disks within a logical volume file system are typically organized as one or more groups wherein each group may be operated as a Redundant Array of Independent or Inexpensive Disks RAID . Most RAID implementations such as a RAID 4 level implementation enhance the reliability integrity of data storage through the redundant writing of data stripes across a given number of physical disks in the RAID group and the appropriate storing of parity information with respect to the striped data. An illustrative example of a RAID implementation is a RAID 4 level implementation although it should be understood that other types and levels of RAID implementations may be used in accordance with the inventive principles described herein.

To facilitate access to the disks the storage operating system implements a write anywhere file system that cooperates with one or more virtualization modules to virtualize the storage space provided by disks . The file system logically organizes the information as a hierarchical structure of named directories and files on the disks. Each on disk file may be implemented as set of disk blocks configured to store information such as data whereas the directory may be implemented as a specially formatted file in which names and links to other files and directories are stored. The virtualization module s allow the file system to further logically organize information as a hierarchical structure of blocks on the disks that are exported as named logical unit numbers luns .

In the illustrative embodiment the storage operating system is preferably the NetApp Data ONTAP operating system available from Network Appliance Inc. Sunnyvale Calif. that implements a Write Anywhere File Layout WAFL file system. However it is expressly contemplated that any appropriate storage operating system may be enhanced for use in accordance with the inventive principles described herein. As such where the term WAFL is employed it should be taken broadly to refer to any storage operating system that is otherwise adaptable to the teachings of this invention.

In addition the storage operating system includes a series of software layers organized to form a storage server that provides data paths for accessing information stored on the disks of the node . To that end the storage server includes a file system module in cooperating relation with a volume striping module VSM a RAID system module and a disk driver system module . The RAID system manages the storage and retrieval of information to and from the volumes disks in accordance with I O operations while the disk driver system implements a disk access protocol such as e.g. the SCSI protocol. The VSM illustratively implements a striped volume set SVS that may be advantageously used with the present invention. As described further herein the VSM cooperates with the file system to enable storage server to service a volume of the SVS. In particular the VSM implements a novel Locate function to compute the location of data container content in the SVS volume to thereby ensure consistency of such content served by the cluster.

The file system implements a virtualization system of the storage operating system through the interaction with one or more virtualization modules illustratively embodied as e.g. a virtual disk vdisk module not shown and a SCSI target module . The vdisk module enables access by administrative interfaces such as a user interface of a management framework see in response to a user system administrator issuing commands to the node . The SCSI target module is generally disposed between the FC and iSCSI drivers and the file system to provide a translation layer of the virtualization system between the block lun space and the file system space where luns are represented as blocks.

The file system is illustratively a message based system that allocates storage space for itself in the disk array and controls the layout of information on the array. The file system further provides logical volume management capabilities for use in access to the information stored on the storage devices such as disks. That is in addition to providing file system semantics the file system provides functions normally associated with a volume manager. These functions include i aggregation of the disks ii aggregation of storage bandwidth of the disks and iii reliability guarantees such as mirroring and or parity RAID . The file system illustratively implements the WAFL file system hereinafter generally the write anywhere file system having an on disk format representation that is block based using e.g. 4 kilobyte kB blocks and using index nodes inodes to identify files and file attributes such as creation time access permissions size and block location . The file system uses files to store metadata describing the layout of its file system these metadata files include among others an inode file. A file data container handle i.e. an identifier that includes an inode number is used to retrieve an inode from disk.

Broadly stated all inodes of the write anywhere file system are organized into the inode file. A file system fs info block specifies the layout of information in the file system and includes an inode of a data container e.g. file that includes all other inodes of the file system. Each logical volume file system has an fsinfo block that is preferably stored at a fixed location within e.g. a RAID group. The inode of the inode file may directly reference point to data blocks of the inode file or may reference indirect blocks of the inode file that in turn reference data blocks of the inode file. Within each data block of the inode file are embedded inodes each of which may reference indirect blocks that in turn reference data blocks of a file.

Operationally a request from the client is forwarded as a packet over the computer network and onto the node where it is received at the network adapter . A network driver of layer or layer processes the packet and if appropriate passes it on to a network protocol and file access layer for additional processing prior to forwarding to the write anywhere file system . Here the file system generates operations to load retrieve the requested data from disk if it is not resident in core i.e. in memory . If the information is not in memory the file system indexes into the inode file using the inode number to access an appropriate entry and retrieve a logical vbn. The file system then passes a message structure including the logical vbn to the RAID system the logical vbn is mapped to a disk identifier and disk block number disk dbn and sent to an appropriate driver e.g. SCSI of the disk driver system . The disk driver accesses the dbn from the specified disk and loads the requested data block s in memory for processing by the node. Upon completion of the request the node and operating system returns a reply to the client over the network .

It should be noted that the software path through the storage operating system layers described above needed to perform data storage access for the client request received at the node may alternatively be implemented in hardware. That is in an alternate embodiment of the invention a storage access request data path may be implemented as logic circuitry embodied within a field programmable gate array FPGA or an application specific integrated circuit ASIC . This type of hardware implementation increases the performance of the storage service provided by node in response to a request issued by client . Moreover in another alternate embodiment of the invention the processing elements of adapters may be configured to offload some or all of the packet processing and storage access operations respectively from processor to thereby increase the performance of the storage service provided by the node. It is expressly contemplated that the various processes architectures and procedures described herein can be implemented in hardware firmware or software.

As used herein the term storage operating system generally refers to the computer executable code operable on a computer to perform a storage function that manages data access and may in the case of a node implement data access semantics of a general purpose operating system. The storage operating system can also be implemented as a microkernel an application program operating over a general purpose operating system such as UNIX or Windows NT or as a general purpose operating system with configurable functionality which is configured for storage applications as described herein.

In addition it will be understood to those skilled in the art that the invention described herein may apply to any type of special purpose e.g. file server filer or storage serving appliance or general purpose computer including a standalone computer or portion thereof embodied as or including a storage system. Moreover the teachings of this invention can be adapted to a variety of storage system architectures including but not limited to a network attached storage environment a storage area network and disk assembly directly attached to a client or host computer. The term storage system should therefore be taken broadly to include such arrangements in addition to any subsystems configured to perform a storage function and associated with other equipment or systems. It should be noted that while this description is written in terms of a write any where file system the teachings of the present invention may be utilized with any suitable file system including a write in place file system.

In the illustrative embodiment the storage server is embodied as D blade of the storage operating system to service one or more volumes of array . In addition the multi protocol engine is embodied as N blade to i perform protocol termination with respect to a client issuing incoming data access request packets over the network as well as ii redirect those data access requests to any storage server of the cluster . Moreover the N blade and D blade cooperate to provide a highly scalable distributed storage system architecture of the cluster . To that end each blade includes a cluster fabric CF interface module adapted to implement intra cluster communication among the blades including D blade to D blade communication for data container striping operations described herein.

The protocol layers e.g. the NFS CIFS layers and the iSCSI FC layers of the N blade function as protocol servers that translate file based and block based data access requests from clients into CF protocol messages used for communication with the D blade . That is the N blade servers convert the incoming data access requests into file system primitive operations commands that are embedded within CF messages by the CF interface module for transmission to the D blades of the cluster . Notably the CF interface modules cooperate to provide a single file system image across all D blades in the cluster . Thus any network port of an N blade that receives a client request can access any data container within the single file system image located on any D blade of the cluster.

Further to the illustrative embodiment the N blade and D blade are implemented as separately scheduled processes of storage operating system however in an alternate embodiment the blades may be implemented as pieces of code within a single operating system process. Communication between an N blade and D blade is thus illustratively effected through the use of message passing between the blades although in the case of remote communication between an N blade and D blade of different nodes such message passing occurs over the cluster switching fabric . A known message passing mechanism provided by the storage operating system to transfer information between blades processes is the Inter Process Communication IPC mechanism. The protocol used with the IPC mechanism is illustratively a generic file and or blockbased agnostic CF protocol that comprises a collection of methods functions constituting a CF application programming interface API . Examples of such an agnostic protocol are the SpinFS and SpinNP protocols available from Network Appliance Inc. The SpinFS protocol is described in the above referenced U.S. Pat. No. 6 671 773.

The CF interface module implements the CF protocol for communicating file system commands among the blades of cluster . Communication is illustratively effected by the D blade exposing the CF API to which an N blade or another D blade issues calls. To that end the CF interface module is organized as a CF encoder and CF decoder. The CF encoder of e.g. CF interface on N blade encapsulates a CF message as i a local procedure call LPC when communicating a file system command to a D blade residing on the same node or ii a remote procedure call RPC when communicating the command to a D blade residing on a remote node of the cluster . In either case the CF decoder of CF interface on D blade de encapsulates the CF message and processes the file system command.

A data container e.g. a file is accessed in the file system using a data container handle. is a schematic block diagram illustrating the format of a data container handle including a SVS ID field an inode number field a unique ifier field a striped flag field and a striping epoch number field . The SVS ID field contains a global identifier within the cluster of the SVS within which the data container resides. The inode number field contains an inode number of an inode within an inode file pertaining to the data container. The unique ifier field contains a monotonically increasing number that uniquely identifies the data container handle . The unique ifier is particularly useful in the case where an inode number has been deleted reused and reassigned to a new data container. The unique ifier distinguishes that reused inode number in a particular data container from a potentially previous use of those fields. The striped flag field is illustratively a Boolean value that identifies whether the data container is striped or not. The striping epoch number field indicates the appropriate striping technique for use with this data container for embodiments where the SVS utilizes differing striping techniques for different data containers.

In the illustrative embodiment a data container is represented in the write anywhere file system as an inode data structure adapted for storage on the disks . is a schematic block diagram of an inode which preferably includes a metadata section and a data section . The information stored in the metadata section of each inode describes the data container e.g. a file and as such includes the type e.g. regular directory vdisk of file its size time stamps e.g. access and or modification time and ownership i.e. user identifier UID and group ID GID of the file. The metadata section also includes a generation number and a meta data invalidation flag field . As described further herein metadata invalidation flag field is used to indicate whether metadata in this inode is usable or whether it should be re acquired from the MDV. The contents of the data section of each inode may be interpreted differently depending upon the type of file inode defined within the type field . For example the data section of a directory inode contains metadata controlled by the file system whereas the data section of a regular inode contains file system data. In this latter case the data section includes a representation of the data associated with the file.

Specifically the data section of a regular on disk inode may include file system data or pointers the latter referencing 4 kB data blocks on disk used to store the file system data. Each pointer is preferably a logical vbn to facilitate efficiency among the file system and the RAID system when accessing the data on disks. Given the restricted size e.g. 128 bytes of the inode file system data having a size that is less than or equal to 64 bytes is represented in its entirety within the data section of that inode. However if the length of the contents of the data container exceeds 64 bytes but less than or equal to 64 kB then the data section of the inode e.g. a first level inode comprises up to 16 pointers each of which references a 4 kB block of data on the disk.

Moreover if the size of the data is greater than 64 kB but less than or equal to 64 megabytes MB then each pointer in the data section of the inode e.g. a second level inode references an indirect block e.g. a first level L1 block that contains 1024 pointers each of which references a 4 kB data block on disk. For file system data having a size greater than 64 MB each pointer in the data section of the inode e.g. a third level L3 inode references a double indirect block e.g. a second level L2 block that contains 1024 pointers each referencing an indirect e.g. a first level L1 block. The indirect block in turn that contains 1024 pointers each of which references a 4 kB data block on disk. When accessing a file each block of the file may be loaded from disk into the memory .

When an on disk inode or block is loaded from disk into memory its corresponding in core structure embeds the on disk structure. For example the dotted line surrounding the inode indicates the in core representation of the on disk inode structure. The in core structure is a block of memory that stores the on disk structure plus additional information needed to manage data in the memory but not on disk . The additional information may include e.g. a dirty bit . After data in the inode or block is updated modified as instructed by e.g. a write operation the modified data is marked dirty using the dirty bit so that the inode block can be subsequently flushed stored to disk. The in core and on disk format structures of the WAFL file system including the inodes and inode file are disclosed and described in the previously incorporated U.S. Pat. No. 5 819 292 titled METHOD FOR MAINTAINING CONSISTENT STATES OF A FILE SYSTEM AND FOR CREATING USER ACCESSIBLE READ ONLY COPIES OF A FILE SYSTEM by David Hitz et al. issued on Oct. 6 1998.

A file system layout is provided that apportions an underlying physical volume into one or more virtual volumes or flexible volume of a storage system such as node . An example of such a file system layout is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 409 494 titled EXTENSION OF WRITE ANYWHERE FILE SYSTEM LAYOUT by John K. Edwards et al. and assigned to Network Appliance Inc. The underlying physical volume is an aggregate comprising one or more groups of disks such as RAID groups of the node. The aggregate has its own physical volume block number pvbn space and maintains metadata such as block allocation structures within that pvbn space. Each flexible volume has its own virtual volume block number vvbn space and maintains metadata such as block allocation structures within that vvbn space. Each flexible volume is a file system that is associated with a container file the container file is a file in the aggregate that contains all blocks used by the flexible volume. Moreover each flexible volume comprises data blocks and indirect blocks that contain block pointers that point at either other indirect blocks or data blocks.

In one embodiment pvbns are used as block pointers within buffer trees of files such as file stored in a flexible volume. This hybrid flexible volume embodiment involves the insertion of only the pvbn in the parent indirect block e.g. inode or indirect block . On a read path of a logical volume a logical volume vol info block has one or more pointers that reference one or more fsinfo blocks each of which in turn points to an inode file and its corresponding inode buffer tree. The read path on a flexible volume is generally the same following pvbns instead of vvbns to find appropriate locations of blocks in this context the read path and corresponding read performance of a flexible volume is substantially similar to that of a physical volume. Translation from pvbn to disk dbn occurs at the file system RAID system boundary of the storage operating system .

In an illustrative dual vbn hybrid embodiment both a pvbn and its corresponding vvbn are inserted in the parent indirect blocks in the buffer tree of a file. That is the pvbn and vvbn are stored as a pair for each block pointer in most buffer tree structures that have pointers to other blocks e.g. level 1 L1 indirect blocks inode file level 0 L0 blocks. is a schematic block diagram of an illustrative embodiment of a buffer tree of a file that may be advantageously used with the present invention. A root top level inode such as an embedded inode references indirect e.g. level 1 blocks . Note that there may be additional levels of indirect blocks e.g. level 2 level 3 depending upon the size of the file. The indirect blocks and inode contain pvbn vvbn pointer pair structures that ultimately reference data blocks used to store the actual data of the file.

The pvbns reference locations on disks of the aggregate whereas the vvbns reference locations within files of the flexible volume. The use of pvbns as block pointers in the indirect blocks provides efficiencies in the read paths while the use of vvbn block pointers provides efficient access to required metadata. That is when freeing a block of a file the parent indirect block in the file contains readily available vvbn block pointers which avoids the latency associated with accessing an owner map to perform pvbn to vvbn translations yet on the read path the pvbn is available.

Whereas the aggregate is analogous to a physical volume of a conventional storage system a flexible volume is analogous to a file within that physical volume. That is the aggregate may include one or more files wherein each file contains a flexible volume and wherein the sum of the storage space consumed by the flexible volumes is physically smaller than or equal to the size of the overall physical volume. The aggregate utilizes a physical pvbn space that defines a storage space of blocks provided by the disks of the physical volume while each embedded flexible volume within a file utilizes a logical vvbn space to organize those blocks e.g. as files. Each vvbn space is an independent set of numbers that corresponds to locations within the file which locations are then translated to dbns on disks. Since the flexible volume is also a logical volume it has its own block allocation structures e.g. active space and summary maps in its vvbn space.

A container file is a file in the aggregate that contains all blocks used by a flexible volume. The container file is an internal to the aggregate feature that supports a flexible volume illustratively there is one container file per flexible volume. Similar to a pure logical volume in a file approach the container file is a hidden file not accessible to a user in the aggregate that holds every block in use by the flexible volume. The aggregate includes an illustrative hidden metadata root directory that contains subdirectories of flexible volumes 

Specifically a physical file system WAFL directory includes a subdirectory for each flexible volume in the aggregate with the name of subdirectory being a file system identifier fsid of the flexible volume. Each fsid subdirectory flexible volume contains at least two files a filesystem file and a storage label file. The storage label file is illustratively a 4 kB file that contains metadata similar to that stored in a conventional raid label. In other words the storage label file is the analog of a raid label and as such contains information about the state of the flexible volume such as e.g. the name of the flexible volume a universal unique identifier uuid and fsid of the flexible volume whether it is online being created or being destroyed etc.

In addition to being embodied as a container file having level 1 blocks organized as a container map the filesystem file includes block pointers that reference various file systems embodied as flexible volumes . The aggregate maintains these flexible volumes at special reserved inode numbers. Each flexible volume also has special reserved inode numbers within its flexible volume space that are used for among other things the block allocation bitmap structures. As noted the block allocation bitmap structures e.g. active map summary map and space map are located in each flexible volume.

Specifically each flexible volume has the same inode file structure content as the aggregate with the exception that there is no owner map and no WAFL fsid filesystem file storage label file directory structure in a hidden metadata root directory . To that end each flexible volume has a volinfo block that points to one or more fsinfo blocks each of which may represent a snapshot along with the active file system of the flexible volume. Each fsinfo block in turn points to an inode file that as noted has the same inode structure content as the aggregate with the exceptions noted above. Each flexible volume has its own inode file and distinct inode space with corresponding inode numbers as well as its own root fsid directory and subdirectories of files that can be exported separately from other flexible volumes.

The storage label file contained within the hidden metadata root directory of the aggregate is a small file that functions as an analog to a conventional raid label. A raid label includes physical information about the storage system such as the volume name that information is loaded into the storage label file . Illustratively the storage label file includes the name of the associated flexible volume the online offline status of the flexible volume and other identity and state information of the associated flexible volume whether it is in the process of being created or destroyed .

The VLDB is a database process that tracks the locations of various storage components e.g. SVSs flexible volumes aggregates etc. within the cluster to thereby facilitate routing of requests throughout the cluster. In the illustrative embodiment the N blade of each node accesses a configuration table that maps the SVS ID of a data container handle to a D blade that owns services the data container within the cluster. The VLDB includes a plurality of entries which in turn provide the contents of entries in the configuration table among other things these VLDB entries keep track of the locations of the flexible volumes hereinafter generally volumes and aggregates within the cluster. Examples of such VLDB entries include a VLDB volume entry and a VLDB aggregate entry .

The VLDB illustratively implements a RPC interface e.g. a Sun RPC interface which allows the N blade to query the VLDB . When encountering contents of a data container handle that are not stored in its configuration table the N blade sends an RPC to the VLDB process. In response the VLDB returns to the N blade the appropriate mapping information including an ID of the D blade that owns the data container. The N blade caches the information in its configuration table and uses the D blade ID to forward the incoming request to the appropriate data container. All functions and interactions between the N blade and D blade are coordinated on a cluster wide basis through the collection of management processes and the RDB library user mode applications .

To that end the management processes have interfaces to are closely coupled to RDB . The RDB comprises a library that provides a persistent object store storing of objects for the management data processed by the management processes. Notably the RDB replicates and synchronizes the management data object store access across all nodes of the cluster to thereby ensure that the RDB database image is identical on all of the nodes . At system startup each node records the status state of its interfaces and IP addresses those IP addresses it owns into the RDB database.

The present invention is related to a storage system architecture illustratively comprising of two or more volumes distributed across a plurality of nodes of cluster . The volumes are organized as a SVS and configured to store content of data containers such as files and luns served by the cluster in response to multi protocol data access requests issued by clients . Notably the content of each data container is apportioned among the volumes of the SVS to thereby improve the efficiency of storage service provided by the cluster. To facilitate a description and understanding of the present invention data containers are hereinafter referred to generally as files .

The SVS is associated with a set of striping rules that define a stripe algorithm a stripe width and an ordered list of volumes within the SVS. The striping rules for each SVS are illustratively stored as an entry of VLDB and accessed by SVS ID. is a schematic block diagram of an exemplary VLDB SVS entry in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The VLDB entry includes a SVS ID field and one or more sets of striping rules . In alternate embodiments additional fields may be included. The SVS ID field contains the ID of a SVS which in operation is specified in data container handle .

Each set of striping rules illustratively includes a stripe width field a stripe algorithm ID field an ordered list of volumes field and in alternate embodiments additional fields . The striping rules contain information for identifying the organization of a SVS. For example the stripe algorithm ID field identifies a striping algorithm used with the SVS. In the illustrative embodiment multiple striping algorithms could be used with a SVS accordingly stripe algorithm ID is needed to identify which particular algorithm is utilized. Each striping algorithm in turn specifies the manner in which file content is apportioned as stripes across the plurality of volumes of the SVS. The stripe width field specifies the size width of each stripe. The ordered list of volumes field contains the IDs of the volumes comprising the SVS. Moreover the ordered list of volumes may specify the function and implementation of the various volumes and striping rules of the SVS. For example the first volume in the ordered list may denote the MDV of the SVS whereas the ordering of volumes in the list may denote the manner of implementing a particular striping algorithm e.g. round robin.

A Locate function is provided that enables the VSM and other modules such as those of N blade to locate a D blade and its associated volume of a SVS in order to service an access request to a file. The Locate function takes as arguments at least i a SVS ID ii an offset within the file iii the inode number for the file and iv a set of striping rules and returns the volume on which that offset begins within the SVS. For example assume a data access request directed to a file is issued by a client and received at the N blade of a node where it is parsed through the multi protocol engine to the appropriate protocol server of N blade . To determine the location of a D blade to which to transmit a CF message the N blade may first retrieve a SVS entry to acquire the striping rules and list of volumes associated with the SVS. The N blade then executes the Locate function to identify the appropriate volume to which to direct an operation. Thereafter the N Blade may retrieve the appropriate VLDB volume entry to identify the aggregate containing the volume and the appropriate VLDB aggregate entry to ultimately identify the appropriate D blade . The protocol server of N blade then transmits the CF message to the D blade .

The present invention is directed to a technique for placing content such as data of one or more data containers on volumes of a SVS. As noted the SVS is associated with a set of striping rules that define a stripe algorithm a stripe width and an ordered list of volumes distributed across the nodes interconnected as cluster . The stripe algorithm specifies the manner in which the data is apportioned as stripes across the volumes while the stripe width specifies the size width of each stripe. Notably the data placement technique selects a volume within which to place a stripe such that all stripes are apportioned among the volumes of the SVS in a manner that improves the efficiency of storage service provided by the cluster.

In the illustrative embodiment the inventive data placement technique is preferably implemented by the VSM cooperating with the file system of storage operating system that among other things controls the layout of data on the SVS. The parameters involved with the data placement technique include i a chunk or stripe width and ii the number of volumes of a SVS. Specifically the data of each data container is organized divided into stripes wherein each stripe has a predetermined stripe width. Illustratively the stripe width is 2 MB although it should be noted that other stripe widths may be selected in accordance with the present invention. Preferably though the selected stripe width should be a multiple of the on disk block size e.g. 4 kB and equal to a power of 2 the latter to enable efficient arithmetic computations.

According to a first aspect of the invention the placement of data across the volumes of the SVS allows specification of i.e. reflects a deterministic pattern of fixed length. That is the pattern determines a placement of data of a data container such as a file that is striped among the volumes of the SVS. The placement pattern is such that the stripes are distributed exactly or nearly equally among the volumes and that within any local span of a small multiple of the number of volumes the stripes are distributed nearly equally among the volumes.

Stripes of data D may be distributed among the volumes in accordance with the inventive technique that reassigns one of N stripes from each pre existing volume to the added volume wherein N is equal to the number of volumes in the expanded SVS. Overall one of N stripes is reassigned to the added volume with each pre existing volume continuing to hold exactly 1 N of the stripes in the expanded SVS. For a 2 volume SVS every other stripe on the first volume is moved to the second volume . When the third volume is added to the expanded SVS thereby creating a 3 volume SVS every third remaining stripe on the first volume as well as every third stripe on the second volume is moved to the third volume . When the fourth volume is added to the SVS creating a 4 volume SVS every fourth remaining stripe from each volume volumes is moved to the fourth volume .

According to a second aspect of the invention the placement pattern is substantially similar for a plurality of SVSs having different numbers of volumes. For example assume one or more volumes are added to existing volumes of a SVS and that stripes on the existing volumes are redistributed among the additional volumes. This aspect of the invention enables re striping of the data by moving a minimum number of stripes while retaining a property of balance across the new number of volumes in the SVS. In general adding an Nth volume to a SVS having N 1 volumes requires moving 1 N of the existing stripes from each of the pre existing N 1 volumes to the added Nth volume.

Specifically the data placement technique can be implemented by storing or generating a data structure e.g. a table in memory containing the placement of stripes for a specific number of volumes in a SVS of specific size. It is also possible to store in a single table all possible placements of stripes for any SVS size up to a certain limit. Here for example the table may store a bitmap for each SVS where the one or more highest numbered bit set is selected that is less than N wherein N is the number of volumes in the SVS. In general any table based stripe placement that maintains balance of distributed data is contemplated by the present invention. The locations of data stripes for the data placement technique are calculated for a known size of SVS volumes or for a maximum volume size of the SVS either way as noted the calculated stripe locations may be stored in a table. A data placement pattern defined by the stored locations and in particular a repeat interval of the pattern can be used to determine the location of data stripes on any volume in the SVS for a given size.

The repeat interval as a function of SVS size is determined in accordance with the set of unique prime factors primes up to N where N equals the number of volumes. The repeat interval which is equivalent to the number of entries in table is less than N factorial and in fact is equal to the product of all primes less than or equal to N with each prime raised to the largest power possible such that the result is less than or equal to N. As some of the numbers between one and N are prime numbers it is clear that the repeat interval may get large making the table large. For example for N 10 the table size is 2 3 3 2 5 1 7 1 8 9 5 7 2520. Similarly for N 32 the table size is 2 5 3 3 5 2 7 1 11 1 13 1 17 1 19 1 23 1 29 1 31 1 32 27 25 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 144 10 12.

A tradeoff may then be made between the table size of the pattern and precision of balancing the table can be terminated at a reasonable point and the SVS size at that particular repeat interval can be used. Thereafter even if there are more volumes than the SVS size the technique can continue to repeat the pattern and still realize nearly uniform balance of data across the SVS within e.g. a half percent. For example as noted above a SVS size of ten volumes translates into a stripe placement pattern that repeats every 2 520 stripes. A table of this size i.e. 2 520 entries is relatively compact in memory and can be computed relatively quickly at start up using appropriate software code. In contrast the table for a SVS of 32 volumes i.e. 144 10 12 entries is too large to store in memory.

The 2 520 entry table works well with any reasonable number of volumes to provide good data balance however it should be noted that this size table is not the only choice and other sized tables may also be used. The 2 520 entry pattern is perfectly balanced for N volumes up to ten for N greater than 10 the pattern provides good data balance even though the pattern has not repeated. In other words although the stripe placement table for a 17 volume SVS is rather large 7.7 MB with 5 bits per pattern if only a fraction of the table is used good data balance can still be achieved. Cutting off the pattern at 2 520 for example yields perfect balance for all SVS sizes up to 10 volumes and less than 1 imbalance to larger SVSs while limiting the table size to 2520 4 bits 1260 bytes for N 11 and 5 2520 bits 1 575 bytes for N 17 to 32.

The stripe placement table can be encoded as a single number indicating a bit position of data stripes for a particular value of N. The table can also be encoded as a single table indicating for all SVS sizes up to some limit e.g. 32 volumes what volumes possibly contain stripes. The determination of which volume actually contains a stripe for a specific value of N is then made by masking off the high order N bits and selecting the highest order remaining one or two or more bits.

To determine the location of a D blade to which to transmit a CF message the N blade uses the SVS ID to retrieve an appropriate SVS entry of VLDB in Step . The SVS entry defines the striping rules including the stripe width stripe algorithm ID and ordered list of volumes associated with the SVS. As noted the stripe width specifies the width of each stripe e.g. 2 MB and the ordered list of volumes specifies the number of volumes in the SVS. Moreover the stripe algorithm ID identifies a striping algorithm used with the SVS. In the illustrative embodiment the stripe algorithm is an algorithm associated with the data placement technique and as such is assigned a unique stripe algorithm ID.

In Step the N blade utilizes the Locate function to identify the D blade to which to re direct the request. As further noted the Locate function takes as arguments among others the set of striping rules inode number and the offset into the file and according to the invention returns the identity ID of the appropriate volume that serves the stripe associated with file offset. To that end the N blade computes a stripe number by dividing the file offset of the request by the stripe width and then determines the location of the stripe affected by the read request by indexing into the stripe placement table using the computed stripe number e.g. the stripe number modulo the table size. In step the N blade forwards the request to the appropriate D blade where the file system and VSM process the request in Step . An example of a technique for processing a data access request directed to a SVS is described in the above referenced U.S. patent application entitled STORAGE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE FOR STRIPING DATA CONTAINER CONTENT ACROSS VOLUMES OF A CLUSTER. The procedure then ends in step .

Advantageously the data placement technique minimizes the number of stripes that have to move for any change in the number of volumes of the SVS while retaining a property that the data is balanced or nearly balanced across those volumes. The novel technique also minimizes the cost of a re striping operation while potentially substantially reducing the duration of such an operation. Moreover the novel data placement technique maintains data balance after re striping.
