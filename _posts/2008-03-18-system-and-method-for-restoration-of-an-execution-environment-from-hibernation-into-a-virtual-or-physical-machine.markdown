This application is a non provisional application of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60 896 679 filed Mar. 23 2007 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR RESTORATION ENVIRONMENT FROM HIBERNATION INTO A VIRTUAL OR PHYSICAL MACHINE which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

This invention relates to a method system and computer program product for restoration of a real hardware server or a Virtual Machine server from hibernation.

Current trends in system and application development involve ever increasing use of virtualized hardware. For example cross platform software now includes not only hardware and operating system independent user applications but also operating systems themselves as well as virtualization means for adaptation of non native OS s to different hardware platforms. Examples of virtualized hardware are Virtual Machines that virtualize a processor and or an operating system running on the processor. Examples of such Virtual Machines are marketed by for example Parallels Software International Inc. Microsoft Corporation and VMware Inc. Other examples of a virtualized server include a Virtual Private Server VPS sometimes referred to as a Virtual Environment VE such as those marketed by SWsoft Inc.

Some ready to start techniques such as LiveCD LiveDistro or the like use a preferably prepared media containing all the data required for starting and execution of a set of processes without installation. They provide an option to start with any hardware configuration but with fewer supported possibilities. Another disadvantage is that started system is used for certain purposes e.g. for hardware testing or configuring and should be removed before starting a native operating system of the computer.

The simplest way to restart a Virtual Execution Environment VEE is by restoring it from backup files created continuously while running the VM VEE such as can be implemented by restoration software from Acronis Inc. This approach could be used when restarting the VM VEE in some current state since some data e.g. virtual memory state is lost in the process of backing up the disk storage.

There are mechanisms in different operating systems that provide a hibernation feature where a VM VEE can be restored from a hibernating state so that application programs can continue executing as if nothing happened.

Microsoft Windows 2000 and later supports hibernation at the operating system level without special drivers from the hardware manufacturer. Safe Sleep the Apple Macintosh equivalent of hibernate has been available for new Mac models. In the Linux kernel Hibernate or suspend to disk is implemented by the swsusp command which is built into the Linux 2.6 series.

Analogous technology may be implemented in a virtual execution environment e.g. VMware products implement a snapshot feature that captures the entire state of the Virtual Machine at the time it is snapshotted including the state of all the Virtual Machine s disks the contents of the Virtual Machine s memory and the Virtual Machine settings. Such a system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 795 966.

What is a need in the art of cross platform saving and restoration of a working state of the computing system. Nevertheless cross platform hibernation and restoration is now a problem that cannot be resolved easily due to different data format of different files where contents of the Virtual Machines should be migrated. Another problem is different peripheral devices used in different platforms and even different peripheral device settings that may be used on the same platform.

For example the operating system that uses IDs of devices e.g. those of PCI devices can function incorrectly or even hang if the System Identification Number is somehow changed between sleep and resume .

Accordingly the present invention is related to a system method and computer program product for providing efficiency while pushing the EE contents out of operating memory into non volatile storage device and further to performing EE functions using data of non volatile storage where the Execution Environment EE include real computing systems running applications and Virtual Execution Environments VEEs .

This method relates to migrating execution environment to new hardware platform or new virtual platform. The method starts with running the execution environment on the hardware platform and suspending the execution environment and storing a state of the execution environment then updating the stored state with drivers corresponding to a new hardware platform then restoring an updated state on the computing system on the new hardware platform then continuing operation of the execution environment on the new hardware platform. The state of execution environment includes operating memory state and nonvolatile storage stage.

Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description that follows and in part will be apparent from the description or may be learned by practice of the invention. The advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.

Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.

Execution environment EE a virtual or real machine intended for program code execution usually determined by basic hardware and software characteristics.

VEE a type of environment that supports program code execution where at least a part of the real hardware and software required for running program code are presented as their virtual analogs. From the point of view or the user that the code in VEE runs as if it were running on the real computing system.

VPS Virtual Private Server or VE is one type of a Virtual Execution Environment VEE running on the same hardware system with a shared OS kernel and most of the system resources where isolation of Virtual Execution Environments is implemented on the namespace level. A Virtual Private Server VPS is a closed set or collection of processes system resources users groups of users objects and data structures. Each VPS has an ID or some other identifier that distinguishes it from other VPSs. The VPS offers to its users a service that is functionally substantially equivalent to a standalone server with remote access. From the perspective of an administrator of the VPS the VPS should preferably act the same as a dedicated computer at a data center. For example it is desirable for the administrator of the VPS to have the same remote access to the server through the Internet the same ability to reload the server load system and application software authorize VPS users establish disk space quotas of the users and user groups support storage area networks SANs set up and configure network connections and webservers etc. In other words the full range of system administrator functions is desirable as if the VPS were a dedicated remote server with the existence of the VPS being transparent from the perspective of both the VPS user and the VPS administrator.

VM a type of an isolated Virtual Execution Environment running on the same physical machine simultaneously. Each Virtual Machine instance executes its own OS kernel. Support of Virtual Machines is implemented using a Virtual Machine Monitor and or a Hypervisor. An example of a VM is a VMware Virtual Machine or Parallels VM.

Hypervisor control software having the highest privilege level for administrating hardware computer resources and Virtual Machines. One embodiment of a hypervisor is used in the Xen open source project and virtualization for Windows Server Longhorn Veridian .

Virtual storage block level storage space that may be regarded by the user of a computer system as addressable hardware storage or a storage partition using virtual addresses that are utilized during virtual disk input output operations as physical addresses.

Disk image a set of data that represents contents of a disk storage or contents of a partition corresponding to virtual storage on a block level.

Migration process of suspending execution environment and starting it on the different hardware platform using intermediate data container. Optionally data in an intermediate data container may be converted to another format or to be updated to provide hardware compatibility.

VM snapshot data required for starting a VM in exactly the same state when it was at the prior moment. Since the snapshot is stored as a file some modification to the file may be implemented before restarting execution environment from the snapshot. One example of the snapshot is Virtuozzo process checkpointing.

Hiberfile a file that contains data that correspond to all or just necessary operative memory blocks of the computing system and processor settings at a certain moment in time. Optionally it may contain other hardware settings and disk data.

The present invention provides for embedding Execution Environments EEs into different hardware platforms in the state as if it were snapshotted or hibernated at a previous point in time.

One feature is storing a current state of the real machine or a Virtual Machine in an available form and then using the stored data e.g. memory state and state of the processor s registers when restarting the EE. Further the EE can be restored with new hardware settings. The process of updating hardware settings including replacing hardware settings or new hardware installation may be performed in the process of EE restoration or before or after EE restoration. In some embodiments environment settings may be updated for effective hardware support before EE restoration by updating a previously stored EE hiberfile or snapshot. Also the VEE can be migrated into a new mode of the same hardware system e.g. using INTEL Virtualization Technology for Directed I O. Another embodiment may include updating a hiberfile to allow restoration of the real machine on different hardware.

Another alternative may include predefined setting patches applied to the snapshot before or during restarting a EE from the snapshot.

Another alternative may include virtualization of the original hardware e.g. SCSI drives or LAN required for effective restarting of the EE and then updating corresponding drivers to drivers required by the current user.

Required drivers can be not only real hardware drivers that are available for new platform where the EE is restarted but also drivers where new virtual hardware is used. For example some virtualized devices may be the new ones. In other embodiments the system may be hibernated on real hardware and restored on a Virtual Machine with the virtual devices being the same as if it were in a real hardware box or otherwise in a real computing system. For implementation of this or other embodiments INTEL VT d technology or similar e.g. AMD DEV may be used. Also a back up of the storage device of the EE might be used. For example if the EE restoration is performed on the same computing system the original storage device may be used for restoring the EE. A snapshot of the EE needs to be created and used to restart in the EE on a new hardware platform real or virtual .

A hiberfile is a hibernation system file and may contain the full contents of the system random access memory RAM . Hibernation is a special kind of shutdown. The system stops all activity and the hibernation system writes the contents of RAM and some CPU settings to a special file on the hard drive often called hiberfil.sys or similar . When the computer such as a laptop awakens from hibernation it does not go through a full reboot. Instead it loads the contents of the hibernation file into memory and thus restores the exact same condition the hardware system was in when the hibernation was started optionally by re initialization of the hardware. Note that hibernation is supported by all modern operating systems e.g. Windows Linux and MacOS.

Since VM technology e.g. computer systems with a VMM or a Hypervisor uses virtualization means and the virtualized OS may in some sense be considered a user application the VM in any state may be suspended and its state may be stored on a mass storage device without suspending of the whole supporting hardware system. Different virtualization technologies use different formats of the snapshot but most of them can store contents similar to hiberfile information. In other words using a hiberfile or a snapshot provides for restoring the EE in the same condition as if it was not interrupted. Knowing the rules of snapshot image creation and the principles of memory management it is possible to convert a hiberfile image of the real system to a snapshot of the Virtual Machine and to convert the snapshot of one VEE with random settings but matched to certain tasks to a snapshot of the VEE similar to a real execution environment e.g. with settings requested by user.

Problems related to hardware differences may be avoided either at the conversion stage or after the start of the EE from a snapshot or a hiberfile image. The simplest way may be for example using Parallels Software International Inc. technology for interrupt handling where interrupts are triggered during a first attempt to call an illegal device or a device that is not installed in the shell of the VEE. Also a lightweight VMM used for Intel Embedded IT or Intel Active Management Technology Intel AMT or vPro may be used which allows direct control of at least some of the hardware from a Virtual Machine.

When the drivers do not match or are not all available after the restart they could be downloaded or provided by the user and then installed or replace the existing ones.

Thus the invention may be used for porting an active EE from one hardware platform to another with minimal downtime. The hardware platform may be either a real platform or virtual platform. As an option where the EE is porting from one real hardware platform to a different real hardware platform one hiberfile may be converted to another hiberfile similar to conversion of snapshot image of the VM. In this implementation runtime updates of an image replacing drivers etc. may be performed.

Minimal booting time is required for starting the ported EE on a different hardware platform since operating system initialization is not required. Updating of the hardware drivers may be implemented by using on the fly patching technology e.g. NuMega SoftICE a kernel mode debugger for Microsoft Windows designed to run underneath Windows such that the operating system is unaware of its presence . This technology may be used for driver debugging and debugging functions of the kernel of the operating system. One embodiment of such a technology is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 725 016 Filed Dec. 2 2003 entitled System Method and Computer Program Product for On The Fly Patching of Executable Code now U.S. Pat. No. 7 472 384 incorporated herein by reference.

Another embodiment of the invention may use OS and hardware embedded functions such as Plug and play PnP signals to force the OS to replace hardware real or emulated by PnP signals issued due to new hardware appearance. An example of such a system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7 111 086 assigned to VMware Inc.

Preliminary prepared patches such as SWSoft s Virtuozzo technology or replacing driver calls by interrupt instructions Parallels Software International Inc. technology may be used for adaptation of the image mainly hiberfile image to the hardware platform. In this case hardware critical for starting execution environment may be initially emulated other hardware calls may by initially ignored or redirected using interrupts and on the fly code analysis.

In an off line version the system is shut down and a set of files that represent the state of Virtual Machine at the moment of shut down stored on a disk. When the set of files has to be restarted from the disk the hardware settings may require configuration and readjustment to be compatible with the hardware platform.

In an on line version the snapshot is generated without interrupting the system on the fly. For example when a snapshot is generated from a live VM there is always a concern for possible discrepancies and inconsistencies between what is actually on the disk and what the VM thinks is on the disk. Ideally the snapshot is generated when all the processes are finished however in the reality the snapshot could attempt to be generated while some processes are still running e.g. writing to the disk is still taking place . If that is the case the transient processes must be completed to avoid inconsistencies between the reality and what VM thinks the reality is.

It should be noted that some emulation may be required permanently e.g. when virtual storage of a Virtual Machine is used after porting a disk drive of the standalone OS. After porting migrating most of user processes running under the control of the OS kernel stay active and continue working with the same contents.

The invention may be used for switching a system from real hardware to virtual or back and may also be used for switching between real hardware platforms or between virtual hardware when required for resolving specific tasks e.g. 3D graphics applications optimization that require different 3D graphics hardware accelerating tasks previously running in the VM with some performance degradation testing execution environment for new hardware compatibility executing hardware testing in less time starting the entire operating system in a background mode emergency secure isolation of the operating system and so on.

Since boot loading in the present invention is drastically simplified the invention can resolve some problems of booting operating systems on non native hardware platforms e.g. swapping guest and host OS s may be performed.

One more option for driver tuning during creation of the hyberfile is to install redirection procedure implemented as a native for EE driver that only redirect I O requests to an already installed hardware driver corresponding to hardware configuration. The redirection procedure transparently replaces the native driver of the EE.

Scalability and portability of any operating system is provided since operating system resources may be dynamically allocated to any hardware environment and are substantially independent of the hardware storage configuration. Optionally the physical system may be suspended and resumed on different hardware boxes or in Virtual Machines with different hardware including Virtual Machines running on remote as opposed to local hardware systems.

The Virtual Execution Environment as discussed herein may be of any number of types. For example they can be Virtual Private Servers. They can be Virtual Machines such as those from VM ware or Microsoft. They can be Virtual Machines in the model of XEN that use a Hypervisor and a Service OS. They can also be Virtual Machines that utilize a Lightweight Hypervisor such as those marketed by Parallels Software International. Also SWsoft Inc. s isolated Virtual Execution Environments such as Virtuozzo may be used as another example.

An example of technology available for updating execution environment snapshot where disk storage format differs from one platform to another is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 757 598 Filed Jun. 4 2007 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MANAGEMENT OF VIRTUAL EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT DISK STORAGE incorporated herein by reference.

The example of effective driver adjustment that may be implemented in the present invention is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 673 585 Filed Feb. 11 2007 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR USING VIRTUAL MACHINE FOR DRIVER INSTALLATION SANDBOX now U.S. Pat. No. 7 941 813 incorporated herein by reference.

One embodiment of code modification that may be implemented for effective code adaptation to hardware requirements is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 725 016 Filed Dec. 2 2003 entitled System Method and Computer Program Product for On The Fly Patching of Executable Code now U.S. Pat. No. 7 472 384 incorporated herein by reference. The technology may be implemented for replacing drivers including usage of redirection procedures for redirecting requests to drivers corresponding to the actually installed hardware.

In step the data in the snapshot is converted to a format native to the real hardware of the computing system. Converted data provides for execution of code contained in the snapshot from the point or the nearest point from the instruction where the VEE was suspended. The data is then stored in a format providing starting executable instructions on the hardware platform e.g. as a hyberfile.sys file usable by OS Windows.

As additional steps data related to the execution environment settings may be updated e.g. data related to number of CPUs related to CPU type CPU vendor e.g. Intel or AMD available memory size Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller APIC version CPU architecture 32 bit or 64 bit and so on. This update may be done for each migration direction while performing migration from one platform virtual or real to another platform virtual or real . Also some execution environment identification and authentication data may be updated including data that characterize environment itself e.g. IP address of the server MAC address data CID security keys for digital signature domain attributes SID user ID user account data or the like.

Also in step code analysis software checks program instruction sequences require modification and optionally settings and drivers of the OS previously virtualized for this VM and loads hyberfile execution without abnormal termination. During step OS template support analogous to SWsoft s Virtuozzo technology may be implemented for embedding required software or substituting some instructions by interrupts then being handled with software debugger as implemented in Parallels Software International Inc. s Virtualization technology. Some other embodiments may include usage of Xen hypervisor VMware Virtual Machine Monitor Sun container Microsoft Virtual Server Parallels Virtual Machine SWSoft Virtuozzo VE or the like. In some embodiments technologies similar to paravirtualization may be used for providing a software interface to Virtual Machines that is similar but not identical to that of the computing system hardware. In one embodiment of such implementation when a request by the EE s driver could not be implemented on the kernel level the request is redirected to an external driver implemented e.g. in the hypervisor or in VMM or on the application level.

Also for Plug and play PnP compatible devices PnP signals may be used for replacement drivers or driver installation using stubs. To implement this option a so called stub driver may be installed before stating environment from the snapshot or hiberfile. The stub driver further may be used as a placeholder for driver required by execution environment or hardware conditions or may be used as a redirection module providing access to appropriate driver. Note that steps and may be implemented simultaneously or independently from each other. When step and at least a part of step sufficient for safe execution of hiberfile instructions are implemented the hardware system starts from hiberfile.

After start step in step the hardware platform suspends VEE operations. In step all memory and processor settings related to the current state of the VEE are stored in the hiberfile or in a similar set of files in the format defined by running OS or defined by software means embedded to the hardware system independently from the OS.

In step the data in the snapshot is converted to a format native for the virtual environment to which the VEE should be ported. Indeed the Virtual Machine may be viewed as available for direct start of operations from hiberfile. The data from which the VEE should start should provide the possibility of execution code containing in the hiberfile or a snapshot into which the hiberfile is converted from the point or the nearest point of the instruction where the VEE was suspended. In the latter case the data is stored in a format providing for starting executable instructions on the virtualization platform e.g. as a snapshot image as mentioned earlier.

Also in step code analyzing software checks program instructions and optionally settings and drivers of OS where the execution environment was previously run. This step provides for a possibility of loading hiberfile or snapshot execution without abnormal termination. Step may be implemented in a number of ways. One alternative is adjusting the Virtual Environment setting as if it were hardware platform where the VEE was previously run. Another alternative is adjusting snapshot configuration according to an already configured VM. Another alternative is adjusting a VM based on the user s choice and then adjusting snapshot configuration according to the VM configuration.

Other alternatives are also possible. OS templates support analogous to Virtuozzo technology may also be implemented or may be implemented by substituting some instructions in the snapshot or hiberfile by interrupts then being handled with software debugger as implemented in Parallels Virtualization technology. Note that steps and also may be implemented simultaneously or independently from each other. When step and at least a part of step sufficient for safe execution of hiberfile or snapshot instructions are implemented the VEE may start in the virtual hardware environment. In step VM support means are initialized e.g. VMM or hypervisor starts under the support of the Host OS and in step the execution environment may be started from the snapshot. The process finishes in step . Note that even a real machine can start from hypervisor as a VEE. In this embodiment the boot partition and the boot VM may be created to start the environment of a real machine inside a virtual environment.
