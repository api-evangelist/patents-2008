Specific reference is hereby made to copending U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60 978 425 filed Oct. 9 2007 in the names of inventors CORINNA MAIER KLAUS J. KIRCHBERG PETER SPEIER and CHRISTINE LORENZ and entitled An apparatus to remotely real time control measurement parameters of an MR scanner and whereof the disclosure is hereby incorporated herein by reference and whereof the benefit of priority is claimed.

The present invention relates generally to the field of imaging apparatus and more particularly to magnetic resonance imaging MRI apparatus and control apparatus for such imaging apparatus.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI is a known technique for obtaining 2 dimensional 2D and 3 dimensional 3D images of a patient based upon nuclear magnetic resonance NMR principles. MRI is widely used in medicine for the examination and diagnosis of internal medical conditions in a patient. Detailed descriptions of MRI systems are widely available in the literature. Briefly an MRI system generally includes an electromagnet for producing an intense magnetic field for covering at least a portion of a patient s anatomy. Typically an MRI system also includes a radio frequency field generator a receiving system coupled to a coil surrounding a portion of the patient s anatomy under study and a magnetic gradient system to localize in space a particular portion of the patient s anatomy under study. Generally an MRI system or scanner also includes a computer based image processing system for receiving signals from the coil and for processing the signals into interpretable data such as visual images for viewing by a physician or other radiology analyst. Generally the system includes MR scanner control apparatus for controlling operation and operating and measurement parameters of the system.

Various arrangements including control arrangements are known in the MRI art. For example U.S. Pat. No. 6 157 194 entitled CONTROL OF MRI SYSTEM and assigned to Fonar Corporation discloses an arrangement wherein a generic MR Host for controlling multiple types of MPCUs such as a WordProgram the Host can communicate with multiple types of printers. Thus the scanner control in this patent controls a plurality of devices.

In another example U.S. Pat. No. 6 198 285 entitled IN ROOM MRI DISPLAY TERMINAL AND REMOTE CONTROL SYSTEM and assigned to Hitachi Medical Corporation discloses an arrangement for controlling a piece of equipment in an MR room by way of an infrared receiver. In this arrangement the control path is contained within a room.

It is herein recognized that the foregoing documents do not contemplated controlling a scanner by multiple types of input applications. Furthermore at least in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 6 198 285 operation is restricted to within a room. No means are disclosed for controlling scanner parameters remotely.

A prior development was to allow the prototype application Interactive Front End to control a real time measurement on the scanner remotely. See the publication by C. H. Lorenz K. J. Kirchberg S. Zuehlsdorff P. Speier M. Caylus W. Borys T. Moeller and M. A. Guttman entitled Interactive Frontend IFE A platform for Graphical MR Scanner Control and Scan Automation Proc. Intl. Soc. Mag. Reson. Med. 13 2005 2170 whereof the disclosure is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Authors Kirchberg Speier and Lorenz are also named inventors in the present application for patent.

The MriProtAccess d .dll uses the OLE Automation which was used by the Syngo architecture and is disclosed in German patent document No. DE 1962584 to which reference is made for further information.

Reference is made to which shows data flow in a block schematic diagram of apparatus in accordance with the present invention. The host system HOST is shown enclosed within a dotted line and is associated with the machine controlling the image scanning apparatus not shown . An examination task card in the host system is associated with the MR Control Software controlling the image scanning apparatus to which it communicates parameters of the image scanning apparatus including scanner control commands in the parameters. Examination task card also communicates with a user .

Block represents an external application running on the host system and communicating by way of a Remote Protocol Modifier . An external application runs on an external machine in the same network as the host and communicates with the host system by way of Remote Protocol Modifier which provides for data interchange over TCP IP and which interchanges data with examination task card by way of a link ProtAccess providing access protocols for the data interchange. The implementation of ProtAccess link in the described present embodiment comprises a User Interface as shown for example in as will be further explained in reference to .

It is noted that application application Remote Protocol Modifier and ProtAccess link are identified as being particularly pertinent to illustrating modes of operation of the described embodiment of the present invention.

Briefly the method of operation of an embodiment of the invention is as follows. In the embodiment of the present invention a method is provided for controlling parameters of an image scanning apparatus. The steps of the method comprise 

Protocol A set of parameters controlling the MR measurement which is available on the MR scanner User Interface

In further reference to characteristics of the User Interface display include as shown by the respective section or panel labels on the display and as numbered in 

Minutes idle Time after which ReModProt will auto Terminate and a with message box If the box is checked the user will get a message box to confirm or cancel pending termination.

The communication from the external application to the apparatus is realized with TCP IP sockets. It is possible to change the port number during execution.

We distinguish between a a set scenario and b a get scenario . a will set a value for a certain parameter into the open online protocol b will retrieve the current value all possible values and the parameter label from the open online protocol.

The name tag sg.0.ext orientation is an exception. Using this name tag the orientation is in a more reasonable format for the external application. It substitutes the name tags sg.0.pe dir sg.0.ori descr sg.0.ori alpha sg.0.ori beta sg.0.rot

The four float values represent an axis of rotation followed by the angle of right handed rotation about that axis in radians.

The reference for the rotation is a transversal plane in the patient LPH coordinate system left posterior head .

Feedback exists for each protocol parameter manipulation. This data is displayed in the Scan Command Feedback Stream see . In the get scenario this data is additionally sent over the socket to the external application using the following syntax 

To set a value for an optional parameter the option number must be set and not the option string e.g. sg.1.ori descr 8 and NOT ori descr T C
