The computer network may be any computer network known to a person of ordinary skill in the art including inter alia the Internet an intranet a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN etc. The plurality of server databases . . . each comprise a content management system . . . i.e. content infrastructure in content flow management tools . . . content association tools . . . content manipulation tools . . . joint development tools . . . community tools . . . and access and security tools . . . . Each of content systems . . . comprises content. Content may comprise any content that may be shared within an organization. For example content may comprise inter alia data software applications shared software routines used by a plurality of software applications software code developed by a plurality of users etc. Each of the content management systems . . . may comprise any type of content management systems including inter alia a distribution system a management system a remote services system a shared source system etc.

Content within a distribution system comprises software and or operating systems. A distribution system is used when technical teams within an organization submit content for products e.g. publications software and operating systems into a distribution center to send to customers and employees of the organization. Metadata regarding the content is collected by the distribution system so that each of the objects e.g. publications software and operating systems may be associated with each of the other products within the distribution system. Collection of the metadata also aides in a discovery process to locate of any of the products within the distribution system. The distribution system is a centralized control system that coordinates all the submitted content. The distribution system may comprise a relational database such as inter alia DB2 AIX Linux etc. and or an operating system s file system. The content within the distribution system such as inter alia executable files components such as shared libraries or installable files for programs i.e. a set of code that can execute a software product are stored in the DB2 or file system so that a user or another program can gain access to them.

Content within a management system comprises data. The management system is used for creating controlling and disseminating the data. The management system may be used to deliver data to a website. The data may comprise inter alia data from web HTML pages data from word processing files data from XML documents data from PDF files etc. The management system is used to group related documents and or a specific content file together to allow users to locate and read the documents. The management system may provide information about projects processes products services etc. Often times a management system is used manage web documents with a taxonomy structure that helps group related documents together to aid in navigation and searching for documents.

Content within a remote services system comprises software routines used by a plurality of software applications. The remote services system is a framework that allows individual software applications to locate shared routines used by a plurality of software applications. The shared routines can be a routine library function an application or any other remotely invoked service. A software routine that may be used by many software applications is registered in a directory along with information describing its function and its interface. When an individual software application is running and requires a particular service i.e. provided by the software routine the remote services system it can look up the requested service in the directory and call the software routine that provides the requested service.

Content within a shared source system comprises documents that can be collaborated upon by a plurality individuals such as software code designs processes etc. The shared source system may group content together e.g. software code grouped together within a software development project . For example the shared source system may group source code files such as C or Java files headers etc. together as related by projects. Software developers may then extract modify and replace source files as part of that project.

The content flow management tools . . . are used for controlling content flow within and between each of the content management systems . . . . The content association tools . . . are used for linking together and providing associations e.g. metadata for the content within the content management systems . . . . The associations e.g. metadata allow associated content from the content management systems . . . to be linked together so that a user may use the associations e.g. metadata to search for and locate the associated content. The associations e.g. metadata are linked together to provide a web of interconnected associated content stored across an organization. The associations e.g. metadata and provide a map to locate the associated content from the content management systems . . .

The content manipulation tools . . . comprise the tools to allow teams within an organization to create modify and promote different types content within the content framework system . The access and security tools . . . comprise the tools to allow administrators of the content framework system the ability to control parties i.e. users who may access or manipulate content within the content framework system . The community tools . . . comprise the tools to allow different teams within an organization collaborate and add value to the content within the content framework system . The joint development tools . . . comprise the tools to allow different teams within the organization to leverage knowledge and technology regarding the content within the content framework system . The content manipulation tools . . . joint development tools . . . access and security tools . . . and community tools . . . in combination allow multiple teams to contribute to a technology i.e. content within the content framework system .

The content flow management infrastructure infrastructure comprises a metadata database an acquisition tool a content management tool and a directory . The content flow management infrastructure is used to provide high level access to content stored in the content infrastructure by other systems. The content flow management infrastructure may be used to submit content into or extract content out of the content infrastructure or to access the content in the content infrastructure . The content flow management infrastructure provides access to content in the content infrastructure through the interface infrastructure community infrastructure joint development infrastructure content association infrastructure and in data manipulation infrastructure . The acquisition tool is for allowing users developers e.g. teams within an organization to interact with the content framework system in order to submit a program component library to a project for storage. Multiple instances of the acquisition tool may exist for the different types of content being stored or accessed in the content infrastructure . The metadata database stores information about the program component library e.g. type of operating system it runs on a version a date submitted etc elements stored in the content infrastructure . There may be multiple instances of the metadata database . The content management tool provides a web or application interface to content within the content framework system .

The content association tool infrastructure comprises a registry tool and an association database . The registry tool is for developing a registry comprising the associations e.g. metadata that connect content across the different systems i.e. the shared source system the distribution system the management system and the remote services system . The registry tool links and provides associations for the information i.e. content within content management system . . . so that the individual teams within the organization may locate associated content within the content management systems . . . to collaborate with each other and provide solutions to problems existing within the content. The association database is for storing the registry comprising the associations e.g. metadata . The content flow management infrastructure cannot associate content across the content management systems . . . because the systems exist in separate instances of the components i.e. acquisition tool content management tool and metadata database and do not have the same content structures. The associations stored in the associations infrastructure reflect the entities of the content stored in each content management system . . . and do not reflect a structure of the content in the content management system . . . existing in the content infrastructure or the instances of the metadata database . Content that is created and input through content flow management infrastructure into content infrastructure comprises association information metadata that is created and used by the registry tool . The association information may be created dynamically each time content is accessed in the content infrastructure or it may be stored in the association database . The registry also contains metadata mappings across the different content managements systems . . . to bridge across the systems.

Users of the content framework system are comprised of innovators exploiters and governance . An innovator is a user who creates new content or contributes to existing content within the content framework system . An innovator is a creator of content. An exploiter is a user who is looking for content within the content framework system but does not contribute content. An exploiter is a consumer of content. A governance is a user that controls the components within the content framework system . The governance controls access and security to the content within the content framework system . A user may be any of the three types and may move between the types. For example an exploiter who finds a technology content that they are interested in may become an innovator if they start to contribute content to the content framework system . An innovator might become a governance if they set controls on the content they create.

The interface infrastructure provides exploiters and governance access to the content stored in the content infrastructure . This access is gained either through the content association infrastructure or the content flow management infrastructure . If a user exploiters or governance is accessing the content flow management directly from the interface then only the individual content management systems . . . may be accessed independently. If a user exploiters or governance is accessing the content flow management through the content association then all content within the content infrastructure is accessible as a result of the associations and mappings in the registry. The interface infrastructure comprises a portal e.g. a web application or any other interface that may be used by a user of the content framework system to locate and view content within the content management systems . . . and a discovery component . The discovery component is used to perform searches across the content flow management infrastructure or the content association infrastructure .

The access and security infrastructure is used to control access to process and content in content management systems . . . infrastructures and joint development and community . The access and security infrastructure comprises an administration tool an access and security tool and a control tool . There may exist multiple instances of any of these components. The control tool is used by a governance party e.g. an administrator to control specific parties e.g. teams comprising exploiters innovators etc. that may access or manipulate content and associations within the content framework system . The access and security tool comprises the tools to allow administrators e.g. governance of the content framework system the ability to control parties i.e. users who may access or manipulate content within the content framework system .

The content manipulation infrastructure comprises the tools to allow teams within an organization to create modify and promote different types content within the content framework system . The content manipulation infrastructure comprises an editor that may be used by an innovator to create or manipulate content used in content flow management infrastructure or shared source tool in the joint development infrastructure . The content created by the editor is used in the content management systems . . . . The community infrastructure comprises the tools community tool to allow different teams within an organization collaborate and add value to the content within the content framework system . The joint development infrastructure comprises the tools shared source tool to allow different teams within the organization to leverage knowledge and technology regarding the content within the content framework system . An innovator comprises a party e.g. a technical team creating content within the content framework system . An exploiter comprises a party e.g. a technical team modifying the content within the content framework system .

An example of usage for the content framework system of is described as follows. An innovator invents a new technology to be used. The innovator creates a patent disclosure and software application for the new technology and submits them into an intellectual property system that is comprised by the content flow management infrastructure through an instance of an acquisition tool . The patent disclosure stored in the content database in the content infrastructure describes the key invention points and how it is unique from prior art. The innovator if they have not done so already starts a project to develop the technology and creates a database table to store project documents design docs requirements docs etc. in another instance of the content database through another instance of the acquisition tool . This step also happens between the content flow management and the content infrastructure . A team is then put together that is managed through joint development infrastructure and controlled by access and security infrastructure . If the technology is implemented as a software application code is developed using the editor in the content manipulation infrastructure and stored in the source database so that a team of developers can access and contribute to the code. Access to who is allowed to create and or modify the code is controlled by the access and security infrastructure .

As the project is completed content is created about the software application e.g. marketing materials online manuals and help files pricing etc. that is managed in yet another instance of content management system . These documents are made available through a network Intranet Internet or other communication system for users to view. The developed product is packaged as an installable application along with documentation on how to use install etc. and sent to the distribution system that will ship physical copies of the applications to customers or make an electronic version available for download by customers from the Internet or Intranet.

Another innovator is now looking to start a new project and is looking for the technology that was created by the innovator above without any knowledge that the first innovator exists . A search of the company s Intranet from the interface into a content flow management infrastructure from an interface using a discovery direct to the content flow management might result in finding a description of the first innovator s product. The second innovator would then need to track down the first innovator and other people with knowledge about the project project documentation and source code or libraries to determine if that technology is usable in the second innovator s project. All of the needed information may not be part of the content that was discovered in the original search for the technology. Without the invention the new innovator would have to find and search through all of the content management systems . . . and all instances within them to locate technologies that could be exploited. The source code would be in one system general information in another project descriptions and people with knowledge in another the usable programs in yet another and IP in a final system. Each of these separate systems may exist in many separate instances in large organizations or organizations that are partnering together. It is very time consuming to look for available technologies within an organization and as a result many groups reinvent the same idea over and over again. In the present invention when the first innovator creates content in each of the different systems . . . meta information about each document is collected by agents and stored in a registry in the content association infrastructure . The meta information contains the name of the author the type of doc source code design doc description etc. short description and other information that describes the content at a high level. The registry tool may look across documents and based on the relationship between meta information infer that documents are related and make a connection. This connection can occur dynamically or can be stored in the association database . When the second innovator is looking for a technology a search resulting in any of the documents created by the first innovator would automatically show the connections to the other documents. This way the second innovator can follow the connection trail to find all material related to the technology being investigated.

The second innovator could then put a team of developers together to further develop the first innovator s technology to be used in a new product. Both teams of developers could co work together through the community and the joint development tools on the base technology and feed more information into the framework . Parts of the system such as source code and design docs would be shared and provide a more efficient way to develop and deploy products The steps for the 2innovator s team would be the same as the first s but with a couple of common shared points.

Any exploiter e.g. or using the invention could look at an organization s knowledge content and be able to locate and assign value to available intellectual capital. By looking at the connections to and from a discovered document an exploited can see who is using an idea what has been developed and how many things have been deployed based on an idea or a set of ideas.

Thus the present invention discloses a process for deploying or integrating computing infrastructure comprising integrating computer readable code into the computer system wherein the code in combination with the computer system is capable of performing a method used for linking together and providing associations for content within a content framework system.

While shows the computer system as a particular configuration of hardware and software any configuration of hardware and software as would be known to a person of ordinary skill in the art may be utilized for the purposes stated supra in conjunction with the particular computer system of . For example the memory devices and may be portions of a single memory device rather than separate memory devices.

While embodiments of the present invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration many modifications and changes will become apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly the appended claims are intended to encompass all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit and scope of this invention.
