title: Network intrusion blocking security overlay
abstract: A database security overlay that identifies each network and local access gateway to a database, and monitors each access path from the identified gateways to analyze each connection to the database and block any connections determined to transport unauthorized or undesirable content. Access gateways that establish connections are identifiable by interprocess communication (IPC) mechanisms employed in accessing the database. An evaluator monitors access attempts, while a tapping mechanism on IPC mechanisms that provide the connections captures access attempts from the access gateways. The tapping mechanism intercepts and forwards access attempts to the evaluator to centralize and focus DB paths amid multiple local and external connections on the DB server. A lightweight check for each local access quickly determines if the access attempt warrants further scrutiny.
