This invention relates to collecting and storing experimental data. More specifically it relates to methods and system for efficient collection and storage of experimental data from automated feature rich high throughput experimental data collection systems.

Historically the discovery and development of new drugs has been an expensive time consuming and inefficient process. With estimated costs of bringing a single drug to market requiring an investment of approximately 8 to 12 years and approximately 350 to 500 million the pharmaceutical research and development market is in need of new technologies that can streamline the drug discovery process. Companies in the pharmaceutical research and development market are under fierce pressure to shorten research and development cycles for developing new drugs while at the same time novel drug discovery screening instrumentation technologies are being deployed producing a huge amount of experimental data.

Innovations in automated screening systems for biological and other research are capable of generating enormous amounts of data. The massive volumes of feature rich data being generated by these systems and the effective management and use of information from the data has created a number of very challenging problems. As is known in the art feature rich data includes data wherein one or more individual features of an object of interest e.g. a cell can be collected. To fully exploit the potential of data from high volume data generating screening instrumentation there is a need for new informatic and bioinformatic tools.

Identification selection validation and screening of new drug compounds is often completed at a nucleotide level using sequences of Deoxyribonucleic Acid DNA Ribonucleic Acid RNA or other nucleotides. Genes are regions of DNA and proteins are the products of genes. The existence and concentration of protein molecules typically help determine if a gene is expressed or repressed in a given situation. Responses of genes to natural and artificial compounds are typically used to improve existing drugs and develop new drugs. However it is often more appropriate to determine the effect of a new compound on a cellular level instead of a nucleotide level.

Cells are the basic units of life and integrate information from DNA RNA proteins metabolites ions and other cellular components. New compounds that may look promising at a nucleotide level may be toxic at a cellular level. Florescence based reagents can be applied to cells to determine ion concentrations membrane potentials enzyme activities gene expression as well as the presence of metabolites proteins lipids carbohydrates and other cellular components.

There are two types of cell screening methods that are typically used 1 fixed cell screening and 2 live cell screening. For fixed cell screening initially living cells are treated with experimental compounds being tested. No environmental control of the cells is provided after application of a desired compound and the cells may die during screening. Live cell screening requires environmental control of the cells e.g. temperature humidity gases etc. after application of a desired compound and the cells are kept alive during screening. Fixed cell assays allow spatial measurements to be obtained but only at one point in time. Live cell assays allow both spatial and temporal measurements to be obtained.

The spatial and temporal frequency of chemical and molecular information present within cells makes it possible to extract feature rich cell information from populations of cells. For example multiple molecular and biochemical interactions cell kinetics changes in sub cellular distributions changes in cellular morphology changes in individual cell subtypes in mixed populations changes and sub cellular molecular activity changes in cell communication and other types of cell information can be obtained.

The types of biochemical and molecular cell based assays now accessible through fluorescence based reagents is expanding rapidly. The need for automatically extracting additional information from a growing list of cell based assays has allowed automated platforms for feature rich assay screening of cells to be developed. For example the ArrayScan System by Cellomics Inc. of Pittsburgh Pa. is one such feature rich cen screening system. Cell based systems such as FLIPR by Molecular Devices Inc. of Sunnyvale Calif. FMAT of PE Biosystems of Foster City Calif. ViewLux by EG G Wallac now a subsidiary of Perkin Elmer Life Sciences of Gaithersburg Md. and others also generate large amounts of data and photographic images that would benefit from efficient data management solutions. Photographic images are typically collected using a digital camera. A single photographic image may take up as much as 512 Kilobytes KB or more of storage space as is explained below. Collecting and storing a large number of photographic images adds to the data problems encountered when using high throughput systems. For more information on fluorescence based systems see Bright ideas for high throughput screening One step fluorescence HTS assays are getting faster cheaper smaller and more sensitive by Randy Wedin Modern Drug Discovery Vol. 2 3 pp. 61 71 May June 1999.

Such automated feature rich cell screening systems and other systems known in the art typically include microplate scanning hardware fluorescence excitation of cells fluorescence captive emission optics a photographic microscopic with a camera data collection data storage and data display capabilities.

An automated feature rich cell screening system typically automatically scans a microplate plate with multiple wells and acquires multi color fluorescence data of cells at one or more instances of time at a pre determined spatial resolution. Automated feature rich cell screen systems typically support multiple channels of fluorescence to collect multi color fluorescence data at different wavelengths and may also provide the ability to collect cell feature information on a cell by cell basis including such features as the size and shape of cells and sub cellar measurements of organelles within a cell.

The collection of data from high throughput screening systems typically produces a very large quantity of data and presents a number of bioinformatics problems. As is known in the art bioinformatic techniques are used to address problems related to the collection processing storage retrieval and analysis of biological information including cellular information. Bioinformatics is defined as the systematic development and application of information technologies and data processing techniques for collecting analyzing and displaying data obtained by experiments modeling database searching and instrumentation to make observations about biological processes.

The need for efficient data management is not limited to feature rich cell screening systems or to cell based arrays. Virtually any instrument that runs High Throughput Screening RTS assays also generate large amounts of data. For example with the growing use of other data collection techniques such as DNA arrays bio chips microscopy micro arrays gel analysis the amount of data collected including photographic image data is also growing exponentially. As is known in the art a bio chip is a stratum with hundreds or thousands of absorbent micro gels fixed to its surface. A single bio chip may contain 10 000 or more micro gels. When performing an assay test each micro gel on a bio chip is like a micro test tube or a well in a microplate. A bio chip provides a medium for analyzing known and unknown biological e.g. nucleotides cells etc. samples in an automated high throughput screening system.

Although a wide variety of data collection techniques can be used cell based high throughput screening systems are used as an example to illustrate some of the associated data management problems encountered by virtually all high throughput screening systems. One problem with collecting feature rich cell data is that a microplate plate used for feature rich screening typically includes 96 to 1536 individual wells. As is known in the art a microplate is a flat shallow dish that stores multiple samples for analysis. A well is a small area in a microplate used to contain an individual sample for analysis. Each well may be divided into multiple fields. A field is a sub region of a well that represents a field of vision i.e. a zoom level for a photographic microscope. Each well is typically divided into one to sixteen fields. Each field typically will have between one and six photographic images taken of it each using a different light filter to capture a different wavelength of light for a different fluorescence response for desired cell components. In each field a pre determined number of cells are selected to analyze. The number of cells will vary e.g. between ten and one hundred . For each cell multiple cell features are collected. The cell features may include features such as size shape etc. of a cell. Thus a very large amount of data is typically collected for just one well on a single microplate.

From a data volume perspective the data to be saved for a well can be estimated by number of cell feature records collected and the number of images collected. The number of images collected can be typically estimated by number of wells number of fields images per field . The current size of an image file is approximately 512 Kilobytes KB of uncompressed data. As is known in the art a byte is 8 bits of data. The number of cell feature records can typically be estimated by number of wells number of fields cells per field features per cell . Data collected from multiple wells on a microplate is typically formatted and stored on a computer system. The collected data is stored in format that can be used for visual presentation software and allow for data mining and archiving using bioinformatic techniques.

For example in a typical scenario scanning one low density microplate with 96 wells using four fields per well three images per field and an image size of 512 Kbytes per image generates about 1 152 images and about 576 megabytes MB of image data i.e. 96 4 3 512 1 KB 1024 bytes 1 MB 1024 bytes 1024 bytes 576 MB . As is known in the art a megabyte is 220 or 1 048 576 bytes and is commonly interpreted as one million bytes. 

If one hundred cells per field are selected with ten features per cell calculated such a scan also generates 96 4 100 10 288 000 cell feature records whose data size varies with the amount of cell features collected. This results in about 12 000 MB of data being generated per day and about 60 000 MB per week scanning the 96 well microplates twenty hours a day five days a week.

In a high data volume scenario based on a current generation of feature rich cell screening systems scanning one high density microplate with 384 wells using sixteen fields per well four images per field 100 cells per field ten features per cell and 512 KB per image generates about 24 576 images or about 12 288 MB of image data and about 6 144 000 cell feature records. This results in about 14 400 MB of data being generated per day and about 100 800 MB per week scanning the 384 well microplates twenty four hours a day seven days a week.

Since multiple microplates can be scanned in parallel and multiple automated feature rich cell screening systems can operate 24 hours a day seven days a week and 365 days a year the experimental data collected may easily exceed physical storage limits for a typical computer network. For example disk storage on a typical computer network may be in the range from about ten gigabytes GB to about one hundred GB of data storage. As is known in the art a gigabyte is 230 bytes or 1024 MB and is commonly interpreted as one billion bytes. 

The data storage requirements for using automated feature rich cell screening on a conventional computer network used on a continuous basis could easily exceed a terabyte TB of storage space which is extremely expensive based on current data storage technologies. As is known in the art one terabyte equals 240 bytes and is commonly interpreted as one trillion bytes. Thus collecting and storing data from an automated feature rich cell screening system may severely impact the operation and storage of a conventional computer network.

Another problem with feature rich cell screening systems is even though a massive amount of cell data is collected only a very small percentage of the total cell feature data and image data collected will ever be used for direct visual display. Nevertheless to gather statistically relevant information about a new compound all of the cell data generated is typically stored on a local hard disk and available for analysis. This may also severely impact a local hard disk storage.

Yet another problem is that microplate scan results information for one microplate can easily exceed about 1 000 database records per plate and cell feature data and image data can easily exceed about 6 000 000 database records per plate. Most conventional databases used on personal computers can not easily store and manipulate such a large number of data records. In addition waiting relatively long periods of time to open such a large database on a conventional computer personal computer to query and or display data may severely affect the performance of a network and may quickly lead to user frustration or user dissatisfaction.

Thus it is desirable to provide a data storage system that can be used for feature rich screening on a continuous basis. The data storage system should provide a flexible and scalable repository of cell data that can be easily managed and allows data to be analyzed manipulated and archived.

In accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention some of the problems associated with collecting and storing feature rich experimental data are overcome. Methods and system for efficient collection and storage of experimental data is provided. One aspect of the present invention includes a method for collecting experimental data. The method includes collecting image and feature data from desired sub containers within a container. The image and feature data is stored in multiple image and feature databases. Summary data calculated for the desired sub containers and the container are stored in sub container and container databases.

Another aspect of the present invention includes a method for storing experimental data on a computer system. The method includes collecting image data and feature data from desired sub containers in a container. The image and feature data is stored in multiple third databases comprising multiple database tables. Summary data calculated for desired sub containers and the container is stored in a second database comprising multiple database tables. A first database is created that is a pass through database. The first database includes a pass through database table with links to the second database and links to the multiple third databases but does not include any data collected from the container.

Another aspect of the present invention includes a method for spooling experimental data off devices that collect the data to a number of different remote storage locations. Links in a pass through database table in a first database are updated to reflect the new locations of second database and multiple third databases.

Another aspect of the present invention includes a method for hierarchical management of experimental data. A pre determined storage removal policy is applied to database files in a database. If any database files match the pre determined storage removal policy the database files are copied into a layer in a multi layered hierarchical storage management system. The original database files are replaced with placeholder files that include a link to the original database files in the layer in the hierarchical storage management system.

Another aspect of the invention includes presenting the experimental data from a display application on a computer. The data presented by the display application is obtained from multiple databases obtained from multiple locations remote to the computer. The data displayed appears to be obtained from databases on local storage on the computer instead of from the remote locations.

Another aspect of the invention includes a data storage system that provides virtually unlimited amounts of virtual disk space for data storage at multiple local and remote storage locations for storing experimental data that is collected.

These methods and system may allow experimental data from high throughput data collection systems to be efficiently collected stored managed and displayed. For example the methods and system can be used for but is not limited to storing managing and displaying cell image data and cell feature data collected from microplates including multiple wells or bio chips including multiple micro gels in which an experimental compound has been applied to a population of cells.

The methods and system may provide a flexible and scalable repository of experimental data that can be easily managed and allows the data to be analyzed manipulated and archived. The methods and system may improve the identification selection validation and screening of new experimental compounds e.g. drug compounds . The methods and system may also be used to provide new bioinformatic techniques used to make observations about experimental data.

At Step of container summary data is calculated using sub container summary data from the sub container database. At Step the container summary data is stored in the container database.

In a general use of the invention at Step features from any imaging based analysis system can be used. Given a digitized image including one or more objects e.g. cells there are typically two phases to analyzing an image and extracting feature data as feature measurements. The first phase is typically called image segmentation or object isolation in which a desired object is isolated from the rest of the image. The second phase is typically called feature extraction wherein measurements of the objects are calculated. A feature is typically a function of one or more measurements calculated so that it quantifies a significant characteristic of an object. Typical object measurements include size shape intensity texture location and others.

For each measurement several features are commonly used to reflect the measurement. The size of an object can be represented by its area perimeter boundary definition length width etc. The shape of an object can be represented by its rectangularity e.g. length and width aspect ratio circularity e.g. perimeter squared divided by area bounding box etc. moment of inertia differential chain code Fourier descriptors etc. The intensity of an object can be represented by a summed average maximum or minimum grey levels of pixels in an object etc. The texture of an object quantifies a characteristic of grey level variation within an object and can be represented by statistical features including standard deviation variance skewness kurtosis and by spectral and structural features etc. The location of an object can be represented by an object s center of mass horizontal and vertical extents etc. with respect to a pre determined grid system.

In one exemplary preferred embodiment of the present invention Method is used to collect cell image data and cell feature data from wells in a microplate. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention Method is used to collect cell image and cell feature data from micro gels in a bio chip. As is known in the art a microplate is a flat shallow dish that stores multiple samples for analysis and typically includes 96 to 1536 individual wells. A well is a small area in a microplate used to contain an individual sample for analysis. Each well may be divided into multiple fields. A field is a sub region of a well that represents a field of vision i.e. a zoom level for a photographic microscope. Each well is typically divided into one to sixteen fields. Each field typically will have between one and six photographic images taken of it each using a different light filter to capture a different wavelength of light for a different fluorescence response for desired cell components. However the present invention is not limited to such an embodiment and other containers e.g. varieties of biological chips such as DNA chips micro arrays and other containers with multiple sub containers sub containers can also be used to collect image data and feature data from other than cells.

In an embodiment collecting cell data from wells in a microplate at Step a microplate with multiple wells is initialized using configuration information. At Step the configuration information used for the microplate is stored in a microplate database. At Step a loop is entered to repeat Steps and for desired wells in the microplate. At Step a well in the microplate is selected. At Step cell image data is collected from the well. In one preferred embodiment of the present invention the cell image data includes digital photographic images collected with a digital camera attached to a robotic microscope. However other types of cameras can also be used and other types of image data can also be collected. At Step the cell image data is stored in an image database. In another exemplary preferred embodiment of the present invention the image database is a collection of individual image files stored in a binary format e.g. Tagged Image File Format TIFF Device Independent Bit map DIB and others . The collection of individual image files mayor may not be included in a formal database framework. The individual image files may exist as a collection of individual image files in specified directories that can be accessed from another database e.g. a pass through database .

At Step cell feature data is collected from the cell image data. In one preferred embodiment of the present invention Step includes collecting any of the cell feature data illustrated in Table 1. However other feature data and other cell feature can also be collected and the present invention is not limited to the cell feature data illustrated in Table 1. Virtually any feature data can be collected from the image data.

In at Step the cell feature data is stored in a cell feature database. In one embodiment of the present invention the image database and cell feature databases are combined into a single database comprising multiple tables including the cell image and cell feature data. In another embodiment of the present invention the image database or image files and feature databases are maintained as separate databases.

Returning to at Step well summary data is calculated using the image data and the feature data collected from the well. In one preferred embodiment of the present invention the well summary data calculated at Step includes calculating any of the well summary data illustrated in Table 2. However the present invention is not limited to the well summary data illustrated in Table 2 and the other sub containers and other sub container summary data can also be calculated. Virtually any sub container summary data can be calculated for desired sub containers. In Table 2 a SPOT indicates a block of fluorescent response intensity as a measure of biological activity.

Returning to at Step the well summary data is stored in a well database. In one embodiment of the present invention the well database and the microplate database are combined into a single database comprising multiple tables including the well and microplate data. In another embodiment of the present invention the well and microplate databases are maintained as separate databases. Returning to the loop continues at Step until the desired sub wells within a microplate have been analyzed.

After the desired wells have been processed in the microplate the loop at Step ends. At Step of summary data is calculated using well summary data from the microplate database. At Step the microplate summary data is stored in the well database.

In one preferred embodiment of the present invention the microplate summary data calculated at Step includes calculating any of the microplate summary data illustrated in Table 3. However the present invention is not limited to the microplate summary data illustrated in Table 3 and other container and other container summary data can also be calculated. Virtually any container summary data can be calculated for a container. In Table 3 MEAN indicates a statistical mean and STDEV indicates a statistical standard deviation known in the art and a SPOT indicates a block of fluorescent response intensity as a measure of biological activity.

In one exemplary preferred embodiment of the present invention cell assays are created using selected entries from Tables 1 3. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention a cell assay is a specific implementation of an image processing method used to analyze images and return results related to biological processes being examined. For more information on the image processing methods used in cell assays targeted to specific biological processes see co pending application Ser. Nos. 09 031 217 and 09 352 171 assigned to the same Assignee as the present application and incorporated herein by reference.

In one exemplary preferred embodiment of the present invention the microplate and well databases are stored in a single database comprising multiple tables called SYSTEM.MDB. The image and feature data for each well is stored in separate databases in the format ID.MDB where ID is a unique identifier for a particular scan. However the present invention is not limited to this implementation and other types and more or fewer databases can also be used.

In one exemplary preferred embodiment of the present invention at Step image data and feature data is collected from desired wells in a microplate using Method of . However the present invention is not limited to using Method to collect experimental data and other methods can also be used. In addition the present invention is not limited to collecting image data and feature data from wells in a microplate and other sub containers and containers can also be used e.g. bio chips with multiple micro gels .

At Step an application database is created. In one exemplary preferred embodiment of the present invention the application database includes links to other databases but does not include any data collected from the microplate. The application database is used by a display application to view data collected from a microplate. In another embodiment of the present invention the application database may include actual data.

In one exemplary preferred embodiment of the present invention the application database is called APP.MDB. However other names can also be used for the application database in the database system and the present invention is not limited to the name described.

In one exemplary preferred embodiment of the present invention a display application used to display and analyze collected experimental does not access over a few thousand records at one time. This is because there is no need for evaluation of microplate detail data information e.g. image or cell feature database data across microplates. Summary microplate information is stored in microplate well microplate feature and well feature summary tables to be compared across microplates. Detailed information about individual cells is accessed within the context of evaluating one microplate test. This allows a display application to make use of pass through tables in the application database .

In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the application database does not contain any actual data but is used as a pass through database to other databases that do contain actual data. As is known in the art a pass through database includes links to other databases but a pass through database typically does not contain any actual database data. In such and embodiment the application database uses links to the system database and the multiple image and feature databases to pass through data requests to the application database to these databases. In another exemplary preferred embodiment of the present invention the application database may include some of the actual data collected or summaries of actual data collected. In one exemplary preferred embodiment of the present invention the application database is a Microsoft Access database a Microsoft Structured Query Language SQL database or Microsoft SQL Server by Microsoft of Redmond Wash. However other databases such as Oracle databases by Oracle Corporation of Mountain View Calif. could also be used for application database and the present invention is not limited to Microsoft databases.

In another preferred embodiment of the present invention a first pass through database is not used at all. In such an embodiment the first pass through database is replaced by computer software that dynamically directs queries to from the second and third databases without actually creating or using a first pass through database.

Returning to at Step a first entry is created in the application database linking the application database to a system database e.g. box . The system database includes configuration data used to collect data from a microplate summary data for the microplate calculated from the desired wells and summary data for selected wells in the microplate calculated from the image data and feature data. This information is organized in multiple tables in the system database .

In one exemplary preferred embodiment of the present invention the system database is called SYSTEM.MDB. However other names could also be used and the present invention is not limited to this name. The system database may also be linked to other databases including microplate configuration and microplate summary data and is used in a pass through manner as was described above for the application database. In another exemplary preferred embodiment of the present invention the system database is not linked to other databases but instead includes actual microplate configuration and microplate summary data in multiple internal tables.

However in either case in one preferred embodiment of the present invention the name of the system database is not changed from microplate to microplate. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention the name of the system database is changed from microplate to microplate. A display application will refer to the system database using its assigned name e.g. SYSTEM.MDB for microplate configuration and microplate summary data. Data stored in the system database may be stored in linked databases so that the actual microplate container configuration and microplate summary data can be relocated without changing the display application accessing the system database . In addition the actual database engine could be changed to another database type such as a Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle databases by Oracle or others without modifying the display application accessing the system database .

The protocol table is linked to a protocol assay parameters table . In a preferred embodiment of the present invention an assay is a specific implementation of an image processing method used to analyze images and return results related to biological processes being examined. The protocol assay parameters table is linked to an assay parameters table . The assay parameters table include parameters for an assay in use.

The protocol table is also linked to a protocol channel table . Typically an assay will have two or more channels. A channel is a specific configuration of optical filters and channel specific parameters and is used to acquire an image. In a typical assay different fluorescent dyes are used to label different cell structures. The fluorescent dyes emit light at different wavelengths. Channels are used to acquire photographic images for different dye emission wavelengths. The protocol channel table is linked to a protocol channel reject parameters table . The protocol channel reject parameters table includes channel parameters used to reject images that do not meet the desired channel parameters.

The protocol table is also linked to a protocol scan area table . The protocol scan area table includes methods used to scan a well. The protocol scan area table is linked to a system table . The system table includes information configuration information and other information used to collect experimental data.

The well table is linked to a well feature table . The well feature table includes mapping of cell features to wells. The well feature table is linked to a feature type table . The feature type table includes a list of features e.g. cell features that will be collected. However more or fewer tables can also be used more or fewer links can be used to link the tables and the present invention is not limited to the tables described for the system database .

Returning to Step multiple second entries e.g. boxes of are created in the application database linking the application database to multiple image and feature databases . The multiple image and feature databases include image data and feature data collected from the desired wells in the microplate. The data is organized in multiple database tables in the image and feature databases.

In one exemplary preferred embodiment of the present invention names of image and feature databases that contain the actual image and feature data are changed dynamically from microplate to microplate. Since the image and feature data will include many individual databases an individual image and feature database is created when a microplate record is created e.g. in the plate table in the system database and has a name that is created by taking a plate field value and adding .MDB to the end. For example a record in a plate table with a field identifier of 1234569803220001 will have it s data stored in a image and feature database with the name 1234569803220001.MDB . However other names can also be used for the image and feature databases and the present invention is not limited to the naming scheme using a field identifier from the plate table .

The image and feature databases tables include a well field table for storing information about fields in a well. The well field table is linked to a well feature table that includes information a list of features that will be collected from a well. The well field table is also linked to a feature image table that includes a list of images collected from a well and a cell table that includes information to be collected about a cell. The cell table is linked to a cell feature table that includes a list of features that will be collected from a cell. However more or fewer tables can also be used more or fewer links can be used to link the tables and the present invention is not limited to the tables described for the image and feature databases.

As was discussed above the analysis instruments modules generate a large amount of data including image data feature data and summary data for sub containers and containers. The raw feature data values are stored as database files with multiple tables described above e.g. . To prevent analysis instruments and or the store clients from running out of file space database files are managed using a hierarchical data management system.

In another preferred embodiment of the present invention Method further comprises copying the first database from the analysis instruments to a store client computers . Such an embodiment allows a display application on the store client computers to view the data collected from the container using the first database copied to local storage on the client computers .

In another preferred embodiment of the present invention Method further comprises locating the first database on the analysis instruments from store client computers . Such an embodiment allows a display application on the store client computers to view the data collected from the container at a remote location on the exemplary data storage system from the store client computers .

The data collected is viewed from the display application on the store client computers by retrieving container and sub container data from the second database on the shared database and image and feature data from the multiple third databases on the shared database file server .

In one exemplary preferred embodiment of the present invention at Step a system database is copied from an analysis instrument to the shared database . The system database includes configuration data used to collect data from a microplate summary data for the microplate calculated from one or more wells in the microplate e.g. Table 3 and summary data for wells in the microplate e.g. Table 2 calculated from image data and feature data e.g. Table 1 collected from desired wells as was described above. The data in the system database is organized into one or more database tables e.g. .

At Step one or more image and feature databases are copied to the shared database file server . The one or more image and feature databases include image data and a feature data collected from the desired wells in the microplate. The data in the one or more image and feature databases is organized into one or more database tables e.g. .

At Step a location of the system database and the one or more image and feature databases is updated in an application database on the analysis instrument to reflect new storage locations for the system database on the store database and one or more image and feature databases on the store archive .

In one preferred embodiment of the present invention the application database is a pass through database that includes links e.g. to the system database and the one or more image and feature databases but does not include any data collected from the microplate. In another embodiment of the present invention the application database includes data from the microplate. The application database is used by a display application to view data collected from a microplate. However the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and other containers sub containers e.g. bio chips with multiple micro gels and databases can also be used.

In one exemplary preferred embodiment of the present invention the pre determined storage removal policy includes one or more rules illustrated by Table 4. However more or fewer storage removal policy rules can also be used and the present invention is not limited to storage removal policy rules illustrated in Table 4.

Method includes HSM steps that provide a method to allow on line access to virtually unlimited amounts of virtual disk space on data storage system . The virtual disk space is provided with a multi layer hierarchical storage management system. The virtual disk space is provided without changing the layout of any database and is invisible to a user.

In one exemplary preferred embodiment of the present invention the HSM steps of Method provide an archival method that implements a three layer storage hierarchy including the disk archive the optical jukebox and the tape drive . However more or fewer layers of storage can also be used and the present invention is not limited to HSM techniques with three layer storage. Additional storage layers in the storage hierarchy are added as needed without changing the layout of any database or the functionality of the hierarchical storage manager. The hierarchical storage manager can copy database files to layers in an N Layer storage hierarchy without modification.

In addition virtually unlimited amounts of virtual disk space can be provided with a three layer hierarchical storage management system by periodically removing re writeable optical disks from the optical jukebox and tapes from the tape drive when these storage mediums are filled with data. The re writeable optical disks and tapes are stored in a data library for later access. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention the data library is directly accessible from computer network .

In a preferred embodiment of the present invention Method supports at least two modes of database file archiving. However more or fewer modes of database archiving can also be used and the present invention is not limited to the two modes described.

In the first mode the store server retains database files on individual analysis instruments where they were originally generated. The store server uses Method to automatically manage the free space on the analysis instrument disks to move files into a layer in the three tiered storage management system. To the end user the files will appear to be in the same directories where they were originally stored. However the files may actually be stored on the disk archive the optical jukebox or in a Digital Linear Tape DL T library.

In the second mode the store server spools database files from the analysis instruments to the shared database and the shared database file server e.g. using Method . The store server s in turn manages database files on the shared database file server using Method . In the second mode the files may also be stored on the disk archive the optical jukebox or in a DLT library.

As was discussed above an analysis instrument can generate a huge amount of experimental data. To be useful the experimental data has to be visually presented to a scientist or technician for analysis.

In one exemplary preferred embodiment of the present invention Method is used for displaying experimental data collected from microplates with multiple wells. However the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and can be used for other containers and sub containers besides microplates with multiple wells e.g. bio chips with multiple micro gels .

In such an exemplary embodiment at Step a list including multiple microplates is displayed from a display application on a computer. The microplates include multiple wells. Cell image data and cell feature data were collected from the multiple microplates. The display application uses an application database to locate other databases including experimental data.

In one preferred exemplary embodiment of the present invention the application database is located on the exemplary data storage system at a location remote from the computer including the display application. The application database is used from the computer including the display application without copying the application database from a remote location on the exemplary data storage system .

In another exemplary preferred embodiment of the present invention the application database is copied from a location on the exemplary data storage system to local storage on the computer including the display application. In such an embodiment the application database is copied to and exists on the computer including the display application.

At Step a first selection input is received on the display application for a first microplate from the list. At Step a system database is obtained for the first microplate from a first remote storage location. The first remote storage location is remote to the computer running the display application. The system database includes configuration data used to collect data from the first microplate summary data for the first microplate calculated from the wells in the first microplate and summary data for desired wells in the first microplate calculated from image data and feature data collected from desired wells.

At Step a second selection input is received on the display application for one or more wells in the first microplate. At Step multiple image and feature databases are obtained from a second remote storage location. The multiple image and feature databases include image data and feature data collected from the one or more wells in the first microplate. At Step a graphical display is created from the display application including microplate and well summary data from the system database image data and feature data from the multiple image and feature databases collected from the one or more wells. Data displayed on the graphical display appears to be obtained from local storage on the computer instead of the first remote storage location and the second remote storage location.
