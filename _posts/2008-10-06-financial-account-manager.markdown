In other instances well known features have not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily complicating the description.

In general embodiments of the invention provide a system and method for managing financial accounts. In general embodiments of the invention provide a system and method for updating multiple financial accounts with an address change. In general embodiments of the invention provide a system and method for alerting multiple financial accounts when cards of those accounts have been lost or stolen.

In one or more embodiments of the invention a financial account manager allows management of financial accounts and has multiple components including a financial institution interface module a change request module a graphical user interface GUI i.e. GUI and a mobile module . The financial institution interface module acts as a link between the financial institution and the financial account manager . The financial institution interface module pulls data from the financial institution associated with accounts at that financial institution and pushes data regarding updates to accounts associated with the financial institution . Pushed data could be for example associated with a change of address of an individual that has an account with the financial institution or a lost or stolen credit card of an individual that has an account with the financial institution . The change request module processes account information that is to be pushed to the financial institution . It in conjunction with the data repository manages the financial account data.

In one or more embodiments of the invention a financial account manager includes a GUI . The GUI allows for user interaction with the system and enables a user e.g. an owner of a financial account joint owner of a financial account custodian of a financial account and the like to input updated data for the change request module to process.

Continuing with a financial account manager includes a mobile module in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention. The mobile module allows a user of the system to make requests e.g. a change of address request or a lost card request from a mobile device e.g. mobile phone smart phone PDA and the like . The mobile module obtains a request from a user through a mobile device and transmits this data to the change request module where it is processed. A user may input a request through a mobile device in various ways e.g. a text message voice commands through a phone call data transmission over the Internet through a mobile version of the aforementioned GUI and the like . The mobile module is a mechanism by which a user may rapidly alert financial institutions of a lost or stolen wallet.

In one or more embodiments of the invention if a user loses his wallet or has his wallet stolen the moment he realizes that his wallet is missing he can notify the financial account manager of the situation. He may send a text message to a number associated with the financial account manager that specifies for instance missing wallet . This text will be processed by the mobile module which may proceed to send a response text back to the user asking for authentication e.g. a unique identifier such as a social security number username password or personal identification number and after authentication the mobile module may send the user a text requesting further details regarding the missing wallet e.g. a permission to inform a set of financial institutions specified by a list of financial accounts associated with the user of potential missing cards .

The mobile module communicates with the change request module during this process and once the user has completed the request process the change request module will send the request data to various financial institutions e.g. financial institution through the financial institution interface module . The financial institutions may then cancel the cards they were informed of or place them on hold until further inquiry. Subsequently the user may receive a text message alerting him to the status of the requests made of the financial institutions e.g. cancellation of card A succeeded cancellation of card B failed cancellation of card C indeterminate and the like . Those skilled in the art will appreciate that this mechanism is a manner by which a user may quickly alert his financial institutions of a lost or stolen wallet and retain peace of mind knowing that he is taking an action that will protect his financial security. For example the mobile module mechanism may protect a user s credit cards from being used by a thief to make fraudulent charges.

In one or more embodiments of the invention the data repository shown in stores account access data. demonstrates an exemplary account access data table . Those skilled in the art having the benefit of this detailed description will appreciate that the table shown in may differ among embodiments of the invention and that one or more of the table data may be optional.

The table of holds data associated with the account access of financial institutions and contains entries including financial institution account type account access and access details . The financial institution entry contains the names of financial institutions e.g. bank A investment firm C credit union D and the like the account type entry contains the types of accounts that those financial institutions offer e.g. checking savings market residential loan insurance and the like the account access entry contains information about the method by which associated accounts may be accessed e.g. server to server script application programming interface API and the like and the access details entry specifies details associated with the account access e.g. connection ports authentication strings usernames passwords URLs and the like .

Continuing with financial institutions may offer various methods by which the financial account manager may access their information technology IT systems and securely push request data relationships are required between the financial account manager and financial institutions for this access to exist . A direct server to server connection may be available at some financial institutions and not available at others in which case the financial account manager is required to use other methods to transmit request data. Another method that may be used by the financial account manager to push request data to a financial institution is a web page script. A web page script is a program that may fill out a web page form on the web site of a financial institution and execute a submit of that form effectively pushing data to the financial institution through their web page. For example some financial institutions have a change address form on their web sites and the aforementioned script is a mechanism by which the financial account manager may push a change address request to a financial institution without having a direct server to server connection in place. The script would simply use the request data of a user and transfer this data to the corresponding fields e.g. original address new address authentication information and the like of the financial institution s change address web page to be submitted. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that there may be other mechanisms not described by which the financial account manager may push request data to a financial institution .

Benefits may be afforded to users of the system including the convenience of updating a set of financial accounts from a single point of execution i.e. the financial account manager as well as increased security when cards are lost or stolen.

Continuing with a financial institution data repository stores financial data associated with financial accounts in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention. In one or more embodiments of the invention the financial institution maintains control over the financial institution data repository and inserts new data upon accepting request data from the financial account manager . For example when a financial institution receives a change address request associated with an updated address of a user and after sufficient authentication from the financial account manager the table entries associated with the current address of the user are updated in the financial institution data repository . Further the data in these table entries are replaced with the updated address information. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that various mechanisms may be used to accomplish this functionality.

In one or more embodiments of the invention a user initially sets up his account in the financial account manager before the user is capable of using the account. In one or more embodiments of the invention the financial account manager obtains identification information e.g. name address social security number driver s license and the like login information e.g. username password security question answers and the like and account information e.g. financial institution type of account account number username password and the like . In one or more embodiments of the invention the financial account manager obtains as much account information for as many accounts as the user provides and then ends the set up process. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that this process may be performed in various other ways and in numerous orders.

In STEP a data item associated with a change request e.g. new address or a missing wallet is obtained. This data item may be obtained from a user through a computer mobile device financial software or other mechanism.

In STEP multiple accounts associated with the user are identified for example by using a unique identifier e.g. social security number provided by the user to access said accounts. In the case of an address change a set of financial accounts associated with the user is identified along with a specified old address in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention. In other words a user may have a set of accounts associated with an address A and a set of accounts associated with an address B. If the user is changing address A to address C but not changing address B then a set of accounts associated with the user and address A but not those accounts associated with the user and address B are identified. Once the accounts are identified permission of the user is requested to generate change requests for a subset of the accounts as selected by the user.

In STEP a change request is generated for each previously selected account. This change request includes the data item e.g. new address as well as any other information required by the financial institutions e.g. account information authentication information and the like .

In STEP each change request is sent to a set of financial institutions associated with the identified accounts through the financial institution interface module. As previously described the change requests may be sent to the financial institutions via numerous methods including direct server to server connections web page scripts API s provided by the financial institution as well as other mechanisms. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that there will be other methods by which to send the change requests to the financial institutions.

In STEP notifications are received from the financial institutions about the status of the change requests and the associated accounts e.g. change request succeeded and account was updated change request failed and account was not updated change request not sent and the like and a report is generated for the user presenting the information of the notifications. The report may list the set of accounts and results of associated change requests as provided by the financial institutions.

In STEP an identifier e.g. social security number associated with a user from a financial institution is obtained. The identifier is used to uniquely identify a user associated with a set of financial accounts.

In STEP a data item associated with a change request e.g. new address from a financial institution is obtained. This data may be associated with an account of the financial institution. For example a user independently updates his address for an account of a financial institution and that financial institution sends that update i.e. data item to the financial account manager for it to update its own system and other accounts associated with the user. In this way the financial account manager may truly keep all accounts associated with an individual up to date with current information.

In STEP multiple accounts associated with the user are identified by using the identifier e.g. social security number provided by the financial institution to access said accounts. In the case of an address change a set of financial accounts associated with the user and a specified old address are identified. The user is then requested to select a subset of the identified accounts to be updated.

In STEP a change request for each previously selected account. This change request is generated. The change request includes the data item e.g. new address as well as any other information required by the financial institutions e.g. account information authentication information and the like .

In STEP the change requests are sent to a set of financial institutions associated with the selected accounts. As previously described the change requests may be sent to the financial institutions via numerous methods including direct server to server connections web page scripts API s provided by the financial institutions as well as other mechanisms. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that there will be other methods by which the change requests are sent to the financial institutions.

In STEP notifications are received from the financial institutions regarding the status of the change requests and the associated accounts e.g. change request succeeded and account is updated change request failed and account is not updated change request not sent and the like and a report for the user is generated presenting the information of the notifications. The report may list the set of accounts and results of associated change requests as provide by the financial institutions. Although the steps described are from a system perspective the steps of the process from a user s perspective are essentially mirrored.

In STEP a user initiates a change request by providing a new address e.g. a CA residence and an old address e.g. a FL residence through the GUI or mobile module of a financial account manager. The user may have multiple accounts linked to multiple residences e.g. FL and NY residences but may only wish to update a set of accounts associated with one residence e.g. FL . The data repository is subsequently updated with this new address information as provided by the user and only applies it to those accounts associated with the specified old address. The other accounts i.e. those not associated with the specified old address are not updated with the new address information. The updates to the accounts are accompanied by timestamps.

In STEP an electronic link is established with each of the financial institutions associated with the accounts to be updated as possible. If a financial institution does not have a direct server to server connection an API a website that a script may access or other methods of electronic access then an alternative means may be used to transfer the request data e.g. a postal delivery or email specifying the requested update .

In STEP the updated address data is pushed to the financial institutions. After receiving the updated address data the financial institutions sends back notifications informing the financial account manager of the status of the requests and accounts associated with those requests. This information will be parsed and reformatted into a form presentable to the user such as a report.

In STEP the user receives the report detailing the status of the requests and accounts associated with each of the financial institutions. An example of this report is demonstrated in .

In STEP an entry of the data repository is modified by updated data either obtained from a user or a financial institution. This entry may be associated with for example an updated address or a missing wallet. The financial account manager then generates request s and sends the request s to a set of financial institutions associated with the accounts to be revised with the updated data.

In STEP the financial institutions e.g. bank A bank B credit union investment firm receive the request s sent by the financial account manager. The request s in return generate notifications regarding the status of the request s and the associated accounts and send the notifications to the financial account manager. When the financial account manager receives the notifications the contents of the notifications are compiled and reformatted into a report.

In STEP the aforementioned report is presented to the user. The report may have elements including bank names e.g. bank A bank B credit union investment firm and the like and request outcomes e.g. succeeded failed indeterminate and the like . Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the report may have various other means and metrics used to present information to a user including graphs charts matrices account numbers addresses card numbers and the like.
