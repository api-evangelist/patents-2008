The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60 992 257 filed Dec. 4 2007 entitled SYSTEM METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR COLLABORATIVE WATERSHED RESTORATION PROJECTS the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Embodiments of the present invention relate to the field of environmental restoration and in particular to collaborative watershed restoration projects.

Healthy freshwater ecosystems across the globe are disappearing at an alarming and dangerous rate. Increasing pressures are continually asserted upon these already stressed and damaged ecosystems. Much of this loss at least in the United States occurs on privately owned lands. While public and private funding exists to assist private landowners PLOs in restoring these ecosystems the bureaucracy and direct costs associated with accessing this assistance creates a strong disincentive to action. Furthermore watershed restoration projects typically take specialized knowledge to conceive design implement and certify. These hurdles may be or may appear to be insurmountable for a large number of PLOs. As a result many otherwise viable restoration projects go undone.

In the following detailed description reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof wherein like numerals designate like parts throughout and in which is shown by way of illustration embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural or logical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.

The description may use the phrases in an embodiment or in embodiments which may each refer to one or more of the same or different embodiments. Furthermore the terms comprising including having and the like as used with respect to embodiments of the present invention are synonymous.

Embodiments of the present invention describe systems methods and apparatuses for use in collaborative watershed restoration projects. A collaborative watershed restoration project as used herein may include one or more restoration actions involving a variety of different stakeholders that when completed provides a positive contribution to the ecological health of at least one watershed.

Embodiments of the present invention will be primarily described in the context of collaborative watershed restoration projects. However other embodiments may include other environmentally restorative projects and or collaborative projects utilizing the teachings described herein.

The restoration server may be locally coupled to a number of databases . The databases may include a resource database a fund database and a project database to store a variety of information as will be discussed in further detail below. These databases may be physically distinct or logically distinct databases. Briefly the resource database may primarily include resource information about various resources that may be employed in the implementation and or design of the projects the fund database may primarily include fund information about funds that may be contributed to the projects or portions thereof and the projects database may primarily include project information related to the projects themselves.

The restoration server may also be locally coupled to an administrator console for initial configuration and subsequent maintenance and operation of the restoration server and databases .

The local coupling of the restoration server to the databases and or administrator console may take place by a direct wired wireless connection or over a private network e.g. a local area network LAN .

In various embodiments one or more of the user computing devices may be locally coupled to the restoration server while one or more of the databases and or the administrator console may be remotely coupled.

The restoration server may include one or more computing devices cooperatively coupled to one another to perform project processes described herein. The restoration server may include a controller and a geographical information system GIS . The GIS may include a number of layers that may be used as organizational overlays for the underlying information stored in the databases . The layers may be used to correlate the underlying information with various geographical locations.

At block the controller may receive resource information and store the resource information in the resource database . Resource information may be information on local technical educational and or professional resources that may be used in design and or implementation of the projects.

In various embodiments these resources may include but are not limited to local watershed councils Soil and Watershed Conservation Districts SWCDs Natural Resources Conservation Services NRCSs 4 H and Extension programs and or other on the ground state federal tribal and or private resources.

These resources may include project coordinators. A project coordinator may be someone with training knowledge of the project processes of the system e.g. general knowledge of funding criteria jurisdiction and permit requirements of various regulatory agencies etc. The project coordinator may also have additional training knowledge related to ecological systems processes of watersheds to facilitate knowledgeable design implementation and or certification of the projects.

These resources may also include contractors capable of designing and or implementing various aspects of the restoration projects and or volunteers to facilitate the design and or implementation. Volunteer resources may come from educational institutions e.g. local schools with teachers interested in field based stewardship learning opportunities students undertaking service learning projects etc. and or from others willing to donate resources as appropriate.

At block the controller may receive fund information and store the fund information in the fund database . The fund information may include information on funds made available for projects from a number of public and private funding sources. These funding sources may include but are not limited to governmental agencies municipalities private investors corporations charitable institutions nonprofit organizations individuals etc.

The fund information may include funding criteria associated with the funds. Funding criteria may be used to target funds to support projects actions desired by the particular funding source. Funding criteria may include matching fund components e.g. desired ratios cost shares etc. landowner eligibility geographical location eligibility e.g. only geographical locations in riparian zones watershed restoration action eligibility e.g. actions tied to desired biological outcomes timelines reporting requirements etc.

In some embodiments the funds may be available and ready for distribution pending satisfaction of the given funding criteria. These funds may be provided to the system through block grants or other methods to be readily available for financing approved projects thereby shortening funding cycles typically associated with restoration projects.

At block the controller may receive project information and store the project information in the project database . The project information may include identification of various factors that limit watershed recovery limiting factors along with specific restoration actions configured to address these limiting factors. In some embodiments limiting factors may relate to stream flow habitat diversity temperature etc.

In some embodiments the limiting factors may be specifically identified by a conservation entity and or regulatory agency in watershed assessments pertaining to specific watersheds. These watershed assessments may exist in report form and may be manually entered by the administrator through the administrator console .

In some embodiments the limiting factors may be generally identified as associated with particular geographical features.

In some embodiments limiting factors and or associated restoration actions may be submitted directly by users through user computing devices . For example a user e.g. a conservation agent private landowner PLO project coordinator member of the public etc. may submit observed conditions e.g. a point or non point source pollutant to the system as a limiting factor. This submission may be subject to verification by the administrator and or other stakeholders e.g. local coordinator agency representative etc.

Many restoration actions that address limiting factors may be organized into four categories general restoration actions instream actions habitat reconnection actions and road improvement actions. General restoration actions may include but are not limited to riparian fencing riparian replanting livestock management e.g. rest rotation strategy grazing strategy off channel watering etc. conifer conservation invasive weed removal and bank restoration. Instream work restoration actions may include but are not limited to natural large wood placement boulder placement and meander. Habitat reconnection restoration actions may include but are not limited to culverts estuarine reconnect existing side channels and alcoves. Road improvement restoration actions may include but are not limited to road alteration and road removal. Many of these watershed restoration actions are directed toward restoring the native form and function of the watershed e.g. invasive weed removal instream work and habitat reconnection while others are directed towards reducing adverse effects of human activities e.g. agricultural operations .

The project information may also include permitting information related to the projects. Permitting information may include details about permit applications required by regulatory agencies for implementing a particular restoration action.

The contents of the fund information resource information and or project information and how they will be used in the projects may be discussed in further detail with respect to more specific contexts presented below.

At block the controller may correlate the information received at blocks and . In some embodiments this correlation may be performed at least in part through generation of the GIS layers . For example a resource GIS layer may be generated to correlate the resource information to various geographical locations a fund GIS layer may be generated to correlate the fund information and in particular the funding criteria of the funding sources to various geographical locations and a project GIS layer may be generated to correlate the project information and in particular the limiting factors to various geographical locations.

In other embodiments other information related to design and or implementation of the projects may be collected stored and correlated in a similar manner. For example in one embodiment information on endangered species may be collected with a corresponding GIS layer being constructed to correlate the endangered species information to various geographical locations.

Unless otherwise specified user interaction with the restoration server may take place through a user computing device associated with the particular user.

At block the controller may receive property data identifying a geographical location from a PLO. The geographical location may be a PLO s property for which a project is desired. The location may be identified through an address of a particular property and or other methods identifying a location with more specificity. In some embodiments the user may provide an address to the restoration server and the restoration server may respond by providing a map e.g. a satellite image map of the address to the user. The user may then provide more detailed information on the location for which the project s is desired. The property data may also include information about the location itself e.g. whether the property is adjacent to a stream.

At block the controller may identify a project partner. If the user associated with the user data received at block is the PLO the project partner may be a project coordinator. Conversely if the user associated with the user data received at block is the project coordinator the project partner may be the PLO.

In embodiments where the user is the PLO and the project partner is the project coordinator the controller may utilize the property data and the resource GIS layer to identify a list of local project coordinators hereinafter local coordinators e.g. project coordinators that serve the designated geographical location. This list may be provided to the PLO for selection. As an alternative the controller may assign a local coordinator at the PLO s request.

The controller may follow selection of a local coordinator with a generation and transmission of an invitation to determine whether the local coordinator desires to participate in the project. The invitation may be sent to the local coordinator as a direct electronic message e.g. email. The local coordinator may accept the invitation and be associated with the project. If the selected local coordinator declines the invitation alternative local coordinators may be selected with invitations being generated and transmitted until a local coordinator is associated with the project.

At block the controller may receive project details from the PLO the local coordinator and or the project GIS layer. The receipt of the project details may include a number of request and response interactions between the controller and various users designed to provide the relevant information for project implementation.

In some embodiments the identified restoration actions may be a comprehensive list of actions recognized as addressing limiting factors that may exist in a watershed. In other embodiments the identified restoration actions may be tailored to the specific limiting factors identified in the geographical location. These tailored restoration actions may be accessed via the project GIS layer.

In some embodiments funding criteria may be factored into identification of the restoration actions. For example one embodiment may only provide funded restoration actions to the PLO for selection. In another embodiment an indication of the level of funding of restoration actions e.g. none lightly funded heavily funded etc. may be provided along with the restoration actions.

The restoration actions may be provided to the PLO in a number of categories e.g. general restoration instream work reconnect habitats road improvements etc.

At block the controller may receive a selection of at least one of the restoration actions for the project and afterwards at block may receive project data related to implementing the selected restoration actions of the project. For example in one embodiment the PLO may select a Riparian Fencing action under the general restoration category. The controller may then transmit a series of queries to procure information relevant to a riparian fencing action e.g. whether livestock enter the riparian zone the amount of fencing needed the setback of the fencing the type of fencing etc. While soliciting this information the controller may also encourage implementation details that increase environmental benefits by providing the user with associated funding incentives. For example A setback of x number of feet will be funded y . 

The controller may also generate and transmit a series of queries to procure information relevant to PLO contributions e.g. labor materials etc.

In some embodiments the project details may additionally alternatively include PLO s desired restoration actions and or objectives. This input may be used directly in selection of possible restoration actions and or as supplemental information for subsequent project process operations.

Referring again to at block the controller may generate a project design criteria PDC a project budget and a funding plan and provide these generated elements to the PLO local coordinator. is an operational flowchart illustrating generation of PDC a budget and a funding plan in accordance with various embodiments.

At block the controller may generate the PDC based at least in part on the selected restoration actions of a particular project. The PDC may provide criteria for designing and or implementing the selected restoration actions. For example a PDC associated with riparian fencing may include criteria such as but not limited to fence placement allows for lateral movement of stream vegetation removal is minimized fencing is not used to create livestock handling facilities or riparian pastures etc.

The PDC may also include criteria related to monitoring managing and or documenting various phases of the project. For example a PDC for riparian fencing may recite a photo monitoring criteria that calls for photos of the project site before periodically throughout and after installation of the fencing.

In some embodiments the PDC may be generically configured towards a restoration action. In other embodiments the PDC may be configured based at least in part on the project details provided by the PLO for implementing the restoration action at the selected geographical location.

At block the controller may generate a project budget that includes an estimate for design and or implementation of the selected restoration actions of the project. In some embodiments the controller may access resource information through the resource GIS layer to determine local cost estimates associated with the restoration actions. In other embodiments general or average resource estimates may be used and updated with local information at a later time.

At block the controller may generate a funding plan for design and or implementation of the selected restoration actions of the project and provide the funding plan to the PLO. The funding plan may identify funds from at least one funding source that can be allocated to designing and or implementing the selected action. The funding plan may be based at least in part on the project budget and fund information stored in the fund database . The controller may access the fund information through the fund GIS layer to identify funding sources having geographical funding criteria satisfied by the geographical location of the project. The other funding criteria of the funding sources may also be cross referenced against the selected restoration actions and associated project details to identify the type and amount of funds both individually and aggregate that may be allocated towards the project.

In some embodiments the funding plan may include which funds may be allocated to each watershed restoration action of the project. This may provide the PLO with information as to which of the selected actions have the greatest funding which may have a bearing on which actions the PLO decides to pursue.

In some embodiments identification of funds that may be allocated towards a particular project may be done to increase the total amount of allocated funds. This may include e.g. allocating funds based on matching components in order to properly leverage matched funds. This may also include utilization of a prioritization protocol to rank funding sources according to associated expiration dates.

In some embodiments the controller may automatically identify the funds that may be allocated to a particular project.

As used herein automatic may mean without manual intervention. It may be noted however that the controller may be preprogrammed to generate one or more messages to users of the user computing devices to acquire the information for said automated process. User response to these generated messages may not constitute manual intervention in the automated process of the controller .

Referring again to at block the controller may generate a restoration project contract and facilitate electronic execution of the restoration project contract by the PLO either directly or through the PLO s representative e.g. the project coordinator . The restoration project contract may provide all the relevant terms of an agreement between the project partners and an entity operating the system for funding and completion of the design and or implementation of restoration actions of the project. If the project partners agree to the provided terms they may electronically execute the contract by providing the controller with one or more of their digital signatures thereby manifesting a mutual assent to the terms.

At block the controller may facilitate engagement of design and or implementation resources based at least in part on the resource information stored in the resource database and the project details. The controller may access the resource information via the resource GIS layer to determine which local resources are available for the project. The controller may identify the local resources to the PLO local coordinator and a number of request for proposals RFPs may be generated and transmitted. The responses to the RFPs may be reviewed by the PLO local coordinator and selections may be made.

The details of the engagement may be entered by the PLO local coordinator and the project budget may be updated at block .

At block the controller may automatically generate permit applications directed to one or more regulatory agencies for approval. The controller may determine which permit applications to prepare by accessing project information stored in the project database . This project information may be accessed through a project GIS layer to map the various restoration actions with the regulating agency governing that action for the given geographical location.

In some embodiments the permit applications may be electronically transmitted to the appropriate regulatory agency e.g. through email. In other embodiments the permit applications may be printed out and manually transmitted through a postal service. Similarly the permit resulting from the permit application may be received electronically or through a postal service. If the permit is received through a postal service an indication of the permit being received may be uploaded to the restoration server . This may be done through a user inputting a permit number and or scanning the permit itself.

While the above embodiment discusses generation and completion of permit applications and receipt of approvals other embodiments may provide permit notifications to appropriate agencies. A permit notification for example may provide the relevant agency with project information pursuant to a general authentication permit.

At block the controller may generate an invoice with the project details. The invoice may be provided to the PLO for review. Upon approval the PLO may submit the invoice to the controller which may in turn facilitate a distribution of the funds associated with the project. Upon distribution of the funds the associated parties may begin the design and or implementation phases of the project.

In some embodiments invoicing and associated disbursement of the design and implementation phases may be performed separately. Furthermore in some embodiments invoicing and associated disbursement may take place in stages. For example 90 of the hard costs may be invoiced disbursed after the design phase is complete the permits have been obtained and the resources have been secured. The remaining 10 of the costs may be invoiced disbursed upon completion and certification of the project. Other invoicing distribution plans may be used in other embodiments.

Ecological outcomes may drive stakeholder involvement in collaborative watershed restoration projects. While the system provides transparency to the projects that are being funded stakeholder confidence may benefit from additional assurances provided through a certification that the projects are satisfactorily completed e.g. in accordance with the associated PDCs . Therefore in accordance with various embodiments of the invention the restoration server may facilitate project certification.

At block the controller may receive a project certification by a user authorized to provide such certifications e.g. the local coordinator. This project certification may certify that the progress outcomes detailed in the project report is a true and accurate account.

In some embodiments the controller may generate and transmit user reports based at least in part on these certified project reports. The user reports may provide a user with relevant up to date information customized to that particular user. For example in one embodiment the controller may issue a user report to a funding source detailing the projects and associated statuses funded by that funding source. The user reports may be automatically generated and transmitted on a periodic basis and or at the request of a user.

Upon receipt of the project certification the controller may generate one or more ecological restoration credits hereinafter credits at block . The credits may represent a quantifiable ecological benefit that has occurred as a result of the project s completion. In some embodiments each restoration action of a project may be associated with a certain number of credits based on any of a number of factors. These factors could include e.g. contribution to the ecological health of a watershed cost difficulty of implementation need associated financial benefit to the PLO e.g. a greater number of credits may be provided to projects having lower associated financial benefits which are therefore less likely to be undertaken by the PLO etc.

Credit definitions e.g. the value of a credit and or the number of credits allotted to a particular restoration action may be compatible with standards promulgated by a third party certification body. In some embodiments the third party certification body may provide periodic updates to the credit definitions. This may occur online through a user computing device or offline.

These credits may be used in a variety of ways. Credits may be provided to funding sources as a return on investment and or to other stakeholders. Credits may be used and exchanged in manners similar to any other type of tradable commodity.

In some embodiments credits may be utilized in regulations under a particular administrative context e.g. a cap and trade system a baseline and credit system an environmental remediation system etc.

Funds from these funding sources may compose the project funds provided to the system which may be similar to system . The system may distribute funds to a PLO project and upon certification of completed restoration actions generate x number of credits . The credits may be distributed among various stakeholders according to the chart in accordance with some embodiments.

The distribution of credits according to chart is 47.5 to private investors 5 to an operator of the system 5 to a licensee of the system 20 to a maintenance fund e.g. public and charitable money for funding of ongoing projects 2.5 to WCB and 20 to the PLO.

As will be readily understood the distributions represented by the charts and are merely an example of one embodiment other values and or stakeholders may be represented in other embodiments.

Memory and storage may include in particular temporal and persistent copies of project logic respectively. The project logic may include instructions that when executed by the processor result in the various project process performed by a restoration server as described herein.

In various embodiments the memory may include random access memory RAM dynamic RAM DRAM static RAM SRAM synchronous DRAM SDRAM dual data rate RAM DDRRAM etc.

In various embodiments the processor may include one or more single core processors multiple core processors controllers application specific integrated circuits ASICs etc.

In various embodiments storage may be a machine accessible medium that includes integrated and or peripheral storage devices such as but not limited to disks and associated drives e.g. magnetic optical universal serial bus USB storage devices and associated ports flash memory read only memory ROM nonvolatile semiconductor devices etc.

In various embodiments storage may be a storage resource physically part of the computing system or it may be accessible by but not necessarily a part of the computing system . For example the storage may be accessed by the system over a network via the communication interfaces .

In various embodiments computing system may have more or less components and or different architectures.

Although certain embodiments have been illustrated and described herein for purposes of description of the preferred embodiment it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that a wide variety of alternate and or equivalent embodiments or implementations calculated to achieve the same purposes may be substituted for the embodiments illustrated and described without departing from the scope of the present invention. Those with skill in the art will readily appreciate that embodiments in accordance with the present invention may be implemented in a very wide variety of ways. This application is intended to cover any adaptations or variations of the embodiments discussed herein.
