The present invention relates to an image forming method using a silver halide photographic material specifically an image forming method of recording a digital data on a silver halide photographic material with little deterioration. The invention further relates to a silver halide photographic material capable of realizing the image forming method.

In the manufacture of a movie a method of making a duplicate by printing on an intermediate film an image data photographed with a negative film for photographing as the original image and further printing the duplicate on a positive film for motion picture to use it for projection has been conventionally used.

In many cases an intermediate film for the manufacture of a duplicate is used two times. An original negative film is printed on a negative type intermediate film to make a master positive film. The master positive image is then again printed on the intermediate film to make a duplicate negative film. Lastly the duplicate negative image is printed on a positive film for motion picture to make a print for screening.

In recent years in the manufacture of movies a method of converting an original image to a film again as an analog image by digital synthesis and edition with a film recorder has been rapidly prevailing. This is for the reason that the degree of freedom of presentation of screen image can be enlarged by the creation of an image that is impossible in the actual world by synthesis and edition with the computer. Various image data can be used as original images for example image data obtained by digitizing the image data photographed with a negative film for photographing with a film scanner image data photographed with an HD video camera image data obtained by computer graphics and the like.

As the number of pixels of an original image for example when a negative film for photographing is digitized with a film scanner to make an image data of 2 048 1 556 the number of pixels is 3 190 000 pixels.

When an original image is conveniently made in a digital data and screened by conventional analog projection as described above processes such that the original image made as a digital data is printed on an intermediate film and then this duplicate image data is printed on a positive film for motion picture similarly to the conventional method are taken.

However when such a method is used a problem has newly arisen with the increase in resolution of digital data. When an original image is printed on a silver halide photographic material the image quality is deteriorated and sufficient image quality for screening cannot be secured. There are problems of the improvement of the deterioration of image qualities ascribable to photographic characteristics of analog silver halide photographic materials such as the occurrence of blur the deterioration of sharpness and the reduction of color reproduction. JP A 10 20461 The term JP A as used herein refers to an unexamined published Japanese patent application . discloses a silver halide color photographic material that is characterized in that the N value of a magenta image by laser scanning exposure is from 100 to 200 m. The N value is the amount corresponding to the blur of an image which patent discloses the decrement of blur of letters in printing on color photographic paper. However a pixel size is 12 m or smaller in resolution of 2 000 dpi or more used in recent years in the field of manufacture of movies so that such an N value is apparently inappropriate in resolving a precise image data.

JP A 62 284344 discloses that in laser film recording with argon Ar laser wavelength 514.5 nm as the green light source little color mixing and improvements in graininess and resolution can be achieved by making coincide the peak wavelength of spectral sensitivity of the green sensitive emulsion layer of a silver halide color photographic material with the wavelength 514.5 nm of argon Ar laser.

However there are no descriptions relating to image recording in high resolution in JP A 7 128791. Further green light source apparatus used in the field of manufacture of movies in recent years is a small size and solid state lasers are mainly used for electric power conservation and the wavelength of the light sources is 532.0 nm so that such a silver halide photographic material as disclosed in JP A 7 128791 is apparently inappropriate in recording a precise digital image data.

Blur and sharpness can be improved by the prevention of light scattering. It has been thought that the greater the surface area of silver halide grains of the constituent of photographic material in particular tabular grains having a greater surface area the greater is light scattering. For example JP A 7 128791 discloses a technique and examples to improve sharpness by containing a fixed magenta dye on a further side from the support of a green sensitive layer containing tabular silver halide grains.

As described above conventional intermediate films are used for duplication by printing thereon with an image data photographed by using a negative film for photographing as an original image so that it is sufficient for conventional intermediate films to use fine silver halide grains having an average equivalent sphere diameter of 0.35 m or less that are almost free from light scattering and capable of highly precise recording.

However when a digital data highly increased in resolution that is different from conventional use is recorded on a limited recording area occurrence of blur reduction of sharpness and deterioration of color reproduction are conspicuous so that conventional intermediate films are insufficient in recording precise images.

Accordingly a silver halide photographic material capable of recording a digital data with little deterioration that is a silver halide photographic material capable of preventing occurrence of blur reduction of sharpness and deterioration of color reproduction and capable of recording a digital data is strongly desired.

Further when digital image data are recorded with a film recorder recording time of 10 hours or longer is required in many cases from the beginning to the end of recording. In this case there is a problem of the fluctuation of photographic performances due to aging from exposure to development process of films i.e. conservation of latent images. There is a difference in time lapsing from exposure to development process between the first part and the last part of recording data and a problem that the tints of images deviate from each other arises. Therefore photographic materials little in the fluctuation of latent image conservation have been strongly desired.

An object of the invention is to provide an image forming method capable of recording a digital data on a silver halide photographic material in high resolution with little deterioration. A further object is to provide a silver halide photographic material capable of realizing the image forming method with little deterioration and having an excellent conservation property of latent images not influenced by aging from exposure to development processing.

The terminology of recording with little deterioration in the invention means to suppress vanishing of the image structure contained in a digital image data at the time of recording as far as possible and suppress the fluctuation of color data at the time of recording as far as possible.

As a result of eager investigations for solving the above problems it has been found that a photographic material free from blur and little in the deterioration of sharpness and color reproduction can be obtained by using fixable dyes and couplers according to the invention in recording highly precise digital data.

 8 An image forming method comprising recording a digital image data which is recorded on the silver halide photographic material as described in any of 1 to 7 above on another silver halide photographic material by an analog method.

The digital image data in the invention will be described. The digital image data in the invention mean image data obtained by digitizing image data photographed on a negative film for photographing with a film scanner image data photographed with an HD video camera image data obtained by computer graphics and the like. In the manufacture of movies in recent years images of high resolution of 2 000 dpi or so have been used but digital images of resolution as high as 4 000 dpi or more are used in some cases. The silver halide photographic material in the invention can be preferably used in recording of digital image data of from 2 000 to 6 000 dpi.

The number of pixels in the invention will be described. The number of pixels in the invention means the total number of pixels contained in the digital image data in the invention for use in recording on silver halide photographic materials. For example when a negative film for photographing is digitized with a film scanner to make an image data of 2 048 1 556 the number of pixels is 3 190 000 pixels. The silver halide photographic material in the invention can be preferably used in digital image data of from 3 000 000 to 27 000 000 pixels.

In the invention for recording with little deterioration it is preferred for blur k of an image at image recording time to satisfy the following expression K . 4.5 m 0.2 K In expression K D is the coloring density of the silver halide photographic material and blur k is the blur m in coloring density D.

It is preferred that expression K is satisfied in all the exposure light sources that are used in image recording. For example in the case where light sources of three colors of red green and blue are used monochromatic exposure of each color is performed and it is preferred that coloring density D at that time and blur k in density D satisfy expression K .

Further it is preferred for expression K to be satisfied in all the region of from Dmin 0.2 to Dmax but in practice evaluation is carried out at two points of coloring densities Dmin 1 and Dmin 2 and it is an appropriate and preferred condition to satisfy expression K in each density. Here Dmin is a minimum value of coloring density in a photographic material which is equivalent to the density after processing of an unexposed film. Dmax is a maximum value of coloring density in a photographic material. The maximum value of coloring density is equivalent to the maximum value of the density of digital image data. In a case of widely used Cineon system the maximums density is a value between Dmin 2 and Dmin 2.2.

As shown in when stepwise exposure is performed by adjusting the exposure quantity to the photographic material so that the pattern develops color in density D the width of diffusion of blurred part of the color image in the areal direction of the image in density of Dmin 0.2 is measured and this is taken as k the index of blurring. The axis of abscissa in is a distance.

For recording with little deterioration in the invention it is preferred for blur k in image recording to satisfy the above expression K . It is more preferred to satisfy the following expression K 2 and especially preferred to satisfy expression K 3 . 4.0 m 0.2 K 2 3.5 m 0.2 K 3 Evaluating Method of Color Purity Factor 

When sensitometry exposure is carried out by monochromaticity of each of red green and blue and the image density obtained to main coloring density in monochromatic exposure is taken as a and other coloring mixed in the color of the density and different from the main coloring density and the coloring density of a color showing high density is taken as b a color purity factor in the invention is expressed by the following expression B Color purity factor 100 B 

It is preferred the condition that the color purity factor expressed by expression B is 80 or more is obtained in all the region of from Dmin 0.1 to Dmax of the main coloring density and it is preferred that the condition is obtained in every case of monochromatic exposure of red green and blue. Dmin is a minimum value of coloring density in a photographic material which is equivalent to the density after processing of an unexposed film. Dmax is a maximum value of coloring density in a photographic material. The maximum value of coloring density is equivalent to the maximum value of the density of digital image data. In the case of widely used Cineon system the maximum density is a value between Dmin 2 and Dmin 2.2.

In the invention for recording with little deterioration a color purity factor is preferably 80 or more more preferably 85 or more and still more preferably 90 or more.

Apparatus that can be used in the invention in recording digital image data on a silver halide photographic material what is called film recorders are not especially restricted and commercially available apparatus can be used.

As commercially available apparatus for example ARRILASER and ARRILASER HD using BGR laser as a eight source system manufactured by ARRI FURY and FIRESTORM using a CRT system manufactured by CELCO IMAGICA realtime and HSR high speed recorder using an LCOS system manufactured by IMAGICA CORP. and Cinevator One and Cinevator Five manufactured by CINEVATION are exemplified.

For achieving the above objects of the invention it has been apparent from the results of eager examinations that the use of a silver halide photographic material designed so as to lessen the deterioration of an image at recording time is extremely effective. A major cause of the occurrence of blur of an image is in scattering of recording light on the inside of a photographic material and the blur of an image can be conspicuously improved by the reduction of scattered light. Light scattering is largely influenced by silver halide fine grains contained in a photographic material so that it is effective to lessen the use amount of silver halide fine grains as far as possible and to make the size of silver halide fine grains smaller is also effective. Since any of these means results in the reduction of sensitivity of a photographic material it is preferred to heighten the sensitivity of silver halide fine grains in advance. It is known to use a dye to absorb scattered light and this means can be preferably used. There are water soluble dyes and fixable dyes oil soluble dyes or solid dispersible dyes in the dyes and water soluble dyes are conventionally widely used in photographic materials but it has been apparent from the results of our examinations that surprising effects can be obtained by suitable use of fixable dyes oil soluble dyes or solid dispersible dyes . For example in a case where a fixable cyan dye absorbing red light an oil soluble cyan dye or a solid dispersible cyan dye is used it is effective to use the dye in an upper layer nearer to a red color sensitive layer as far as possible. This is presumably due to the fact that the influence of scattered light can be minimized by the elimination of red light having been subjected to scattering in the photographic material just before arriving the red color sensitive layer. Further for increasing color purity it is effective to prevent color mixture. When the use amount of a color mixing preventive used in the intermediate layer between each color sensitive layer is insufficient color mixture by processing occurs while when an excess amount is used the sensitivity of the photographic material is reduced so that it is effective to optimize the amount. It is also important to reduce spectral color mixture by photosensitization of color sensitive layers different from exposure color. For example spectral color mixture can be reduced by making differences between green sensitivity blue sensitivity and red sensitivity in a red color sensitive layer great and it is very effective for that purpose for the wavelengths of red light at the time of recording and red sensitivity of a photographic material to coincide.

It is sufficient for a magenta dye in the invention to have spectral absorption maximum wavelength substantially in the range of from 500 to 600 nm in the dry film of a photographic material to which the dye has been added and dyes may be used by one kind alone or two or more dyes may be used in combination.

It is sufficient for a cyan dye in the invention to have spectral absorption maximum wavelength substantially in the range of from 600 to 700 nm in the dry film of a photographic material to which the dye has been added and dyes may be used by one kind alone or two or more dyes may be used in combination.

In the invention the terminology dye is fixed means that a dye added to an objective layer in preparation of the layer during the manufacture of a photographic material is substantially present in the objective layer without being diffused to layers other than the objective layer even after manufacture. A means to fix a dye in an objective layer may be any means for example the following methods are known.

As the addition methods of a dye to an objective layer a method of directly dyeing gelatin an oil in water dispersion method as described later that is a method of adding a dye by dissolving the dye with a high boiling point organic solvent having a boiling point of 175 C. or higher under normal pressure and if necessary using an organic solvent having a boiling point of from 50 to 160 C. and emulsifying and dispersing the dye in a gelatin aqueous solution containing a surfactant a method of adding a dye of solid dispersion as disclosed in WO 88 4974 JP T 1 502912 the term JP T as used herein refers to a published Japanese translation of a PCT application and EP 0 456 148 and a method of preventing a dye from diffusion via a polymer mordant are exemplified. Representative polymer mordants are disclosed e.g. in JP A 5 188548 chemical 9 . Any of the above methods can be used in the invention.

In the invention dyes are added so as to reach the average optical density of preferably from 0.005 to 0.50 and more preferably from 0.02 to 0.30 in the region of from 500 to 600 nm with a magenta dye and in the region of from 600 to 700 nm with a cyan dye respectively in the dry film of an objective layer. The density is found as follows. A dye is coated with gelatin on a transparent support and dried to prepare a sample and the density of the sample in wavelengths of from 500 to 600 nm or from 600 to 700 nm is measured with a spectrophotometer. An average optical density in the region of 500 to 600 nm or from 600 to 700 nm is found from the integrated value.

The specific examples of magenta dyes and cyan dyes for use in the invention are shown below but the invention is not restricted thereto.

The specific examples of the magenta couplers represented by formula Z for use in the invention are shown below but the invention is not restricted to these compounds.

Couplers for use in the invention can be introduced into at photographic material by various well known dispersing methods. The dispersion of the coupler in the invention can be prepared by dissolving the coupler in a low boiling point or partially water soluble auxiliary organic solvent. As one embodiment of the invention the coupler dispersion can be prepared with or without using a high boiling point organic solvent.

The aqueous phase of coupler dispersion for use in the invention preferably contains gelatin as hydrophobic colloid. The hydrophobic colloid may be gelatin or modified gelatins such as acetylated gelatin phthalated gelatin and gelatin oxide. Gelatin may be processed with a base such as line processed gelatin or with art acid such as acid processed ossein gelatin. Further other hydrophilic colloids such as water soluble polymers or copolymers may be used. Although not limitative they include polyvinyl alcohol partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate co vinyl alcohol hydroxyethyl cellulose polyacrylic acid poly 1 vinylpyrrolidone sodium polystyrenesulfonate poly 2 acrylamido 2 methane sulfonic acid and polyacrylamide. Copolymers of these polymers having hydrophobic monomers may be used.

Surfactants may be present in the aqueous phase or organic phase or dispersion can be prepared without using a surfactant. Surfactants that can be used in the invention are cationic anionic amphoteric and nonionic surfactants. The proportion of surfactant to a liquid organic solution is generally in the range of from 0.5 to 25 mass in the case where small grain dispersion for photographic use is prepared.

It is preferred for spectral sensitizing dyestuffs A and B for use in the invention to have proper difference in hydrophilic hydrophobic property. It is known that generally the higher the hydrophobic property of a spectral sensitizing dyestuff the higher is the adsorption energy of the dyestuff onto silver halide grains and the lower the lower. It is also known that the hydrophilic hydrophobic property of a spectral sensitizing dyestuff can be generally controlled by the selection of the nucleus substituent the number of methine chains and the kind of substituents on the N position.

As an index of the hydrophilic hydrophobic property of a compound e.g. ClogP is used. Hydrophilic hydrophobic property can be generally found by a distribution coefficient of octanol water of a compound logP . Specifically hydrophilic hydrophobic property can be obtained by practical measurement according to the flask shaking method described in the following literature 1 .

Literature 1 Yakubutsu no Kozo Kassei Sokan Drug Design to Sayokiko Kenkyu eno Shishin Correlation of Structure and Activity of Chemicals Index to Study of Drug Design and Mechanism of Action Kagaku no Ryoiki Chemical Region compiled by Toshio Fujita the representative of Kozo Kassei Sokan Kondankai Social Gathering of Correlation of Structure and Activity Extra Number No. 122 Chapter 2 pages 43 to 203 published by Nankodo Co. Ltd. 1979 . The flask shaking method is in particular described on pages 86 to 89.

However there are cases where measurement is difficult when logP is 3 or more therefore measurement is regulated by using a model for computing logP. For example there is CLOGP program of Hansch Leo Daylight Chemical Information Systems U.S.A. ClogP can be computed with the version of algorithm of 4.01 and fragment data base of 17. Herein P represents a distribution coefficient of octanol water of a compound and logP is the logarithm thereof. ClogP is logP found by computation and in the invention ClogP is found by computation according to CLOGP program C means that it is found by computation . 

In the above computation ClogP of the spectral sensitizing dyestuff A according to the invention is preferably the case of 0.5 or less more preferably 1.7 or less and most preferably 1.9 or less. ClogP of the spectral sensitizing dyestuff B according to the invention is preferably the case of 1.0 or more more preferably 0.9 or more and most preferably 0.8 or more.

By appropriately controlling the difference in hydrophilic hydrophobic property of spectral sensitizing dyestuffs A and B for use in the invention it is possible to cause difference in adsorption energy onto the surface of silver halide. Further the higher the adsorption energy the higher is the forming efficiency of J association on the surfaces of silver halide grains. Accordingly spectral sensitizing dyestuff B according to the invention high in adsorption energy forms stronger J association on the surfaces of silver halide grains as compared with spectral sensitizing dyestuff A according to the invention does. On the other hand spectral sensitizing dyestuff A according to the invention is taken into J association of spectral sensitizing dyestuff B according to the invention since there is difference in adsorption energy so that mixed J association can be found. That is according to the difference in hydrophilic hydrophobic property between spectral sensitizing dyestuffs A and B for use in the invention it is possible to control the peak wavelength of spectral sensitivity to arbitrary peak wavelength.

Spectral sensitizing dyestuff B taken in which is used in the invention shows stronger adsorptivity as compared with the case where spectral sensitizing dyestuff B is present alone on the surfaces of silver halide grains since spectral sensitizing dyestuff A for use in the invention serves for as an anchor. Therefore starting of the spectral sensitizing dyestuff in the silver halide photographic material can be remarkably improved and color mixture ascribable to transfer of a spectral sensitizing dyestuff to other photosensitive layers can be conspicuously restrained.

That is as is known in the field of the industry two or more kinds of different spectral sensitizing dyestuffs are used in combination to obtain spectral wavelength peak that cannot be obtained by one kind of spectral sensitizing dyestuff alone and it is important to appropriately select spectral sensitizing dyestuffs different in ClogP value for obtaining desired wavelength peak and from the point of prevention of color mixture.

It is preferred to use Compound ExS 21 described in Example 1 of the invention as spectral sensitizing dyestuff A for use in the invention and Compound ExS 22 shown below as spectral sensitizing dyestuff B for use in the invention. By combining these sensitizing dyestuffs it has become possible to obtain spectral sensitivity having absorption maximum in the vicinity of 530 nm suitable for a solid state laser for a green light source used in recent years in the field of manufacture of movies. However it should not be construed that the invention is limited thereto.

In general when adsorption energy of a spectral sensitizing dyestuff onto the surfaces of silver halide grains is high the spectral sensitizing dyestuff remains in the silver halide photographic material after processing and causes color residue. Further when the adsorption energy is low color mixture ascribable to starting of the spectral sensitizing dyestuff to other photosensitive layers occurs.

Accordingly it is important to appropriately set the use ratio of spectral sensitizing dyestuffs different in the hydrophilic hydrophobic property from the viewpoint of prevention of color residue and color mixture.

That is in the invention for recording with little deterioration and free from color mixture and color residue it is preferred for the addition amounts of spectral sensitizing dyestuffs A and B to the emulsions of photosensitive layers to satisfy the following expression II 1 and it is more preferred to satisfy the following expression II 2 . 0.6 formula mol mol Ag formula mol mol Ag 1.6 II 1 0.8 formula mol mol Ag formula mol mol Ag 1.2 II 2 

Silver halide grains of the emulsion to which spectral sensitizing dyestuffs A and B are added are preferably cubic grains having 100 faces as external surfaces. A spectral sensitizing dyestuff is generally thermodynamically more stabilized by external surfaces of silver halide grains of 100 faces than 111 faces. Seeing a silver halide rain from the external surface as to 100 face halogen ion sites on which a spectral sensitizing dyestuff is to be adsorbed are in a row in an orderly way in 110 direction but as to 111 face it is said that silver ion accounts for 3 7 of the lattice points on the uppermost layer so that it can be said that it is relatively difficult for a spectral sensitizing dyestuff to form an association.

Accordingly for recording free from color mixture the silver halide grains are preferably cubic grains having 100 faces as external surfaces

The monodispersed emulsions disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 574 628 3 655 394 and British Patent 1 413 748 can also be preferably used.

Crystal structure may be homogeneous or the inside and outside of crystal structure may consist of heterogeneous halide compositions or may take a laminar structure. Silver halides having different compositions may conjugate by epitaxial conjugation or silver halide may conjugate with compounds other than silver halide e.g. silver rhodanate or lead oxide. Alternatively mixtures of grains of various crystal forms may be used.

The emulsions may have dislocation. For introducing dislocation a method of forming a high silver iodide layer by the addition of an aqueous solution such as alkali iodide a method of adding AgI line grains and the method disclosed in JP A 5 323487 can be used.

The emulsions may be a surface latent image type emulsion forming a latent image mainly on the surface of grains may be an internal latent image type emulsion forming a latent image on the inside of grains or may be the type having latent images both on the surface and inside of grains but negative emulsions are preferred. Of internal latent image type emulsions the core shell type internal latent image type emulsion as disclosed in JP A 63 264740 may be used and the preparing method of the emulsion is disclosed in JP A 59 133542. The thickness of the shell of this type of emulsion differs dependent upon development processing and the like but the thickness is preferably from 3 to 40 nm and especially preferably from 5 to 20 nm.

As reduction sensitization preferably used in the invention any of the following methods can be used for example a method of adding a reduction sensitizer to silver halide a method of growing or ripening silver halide grains in low pAg atmosphere of pAg of 1 to 7 called silver ripening and a method of growing or ripening silver halide grains in high pH atmosphere of pH of 8 to 11 called high pH ripening. Two or more of these methods can be used in combination.

The method of adding a reduction sensitizer is especially preferred for capable of delicately regulating the stage of reduction sensitization.

These reduction sensitizers can be selectively used in the reduction sensitization in the invention and two or more compounds can be used in combination. In connection with the methods of reduction sensitization the methods disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2 518 698 3 201 254 3 411 917 3 779 777 and 3 930 867 and in regarding the using methods of reduction sensitizers JP B 57 33572 JP B 58 1410 and JP A 57 179835 can be used respectively.

As preferred compounds 3 5 disulfocatechol disodium salt 4 sulfo catechol ammonium salt 2 3 dihydroxy 7 sulfonaphthalene sodium salt and 2 3 dihydroxy 6 7 disulfonaphthalene potassium salt are specifically exemplified.

Since the addition amount of a reduction sensitizer depends upon the manufacturing conditions of emulsion it is necessary to select addition amount but is appropriately from 10to 10mol per mol of the silver halide. A reduction sensitizer is dissolved in water or solvents such as alcohols glycols ketones esters or amides and added to silver halide grains during the grain growth.

As silver halide solvents that can be used in the invention a organic thioethers as disclosed in U.S. Pat.

Especially preferred solvents are thiocyanate ammonia and tetramethylthiourea. The amount of solvents used depends upon the kinds of solvents. For example in the case of thiocyanate a preferred amount is from 1 10to 1 10mol per mol of the silver halide.

In the manufacture of the emulsion in the invention e.g. at the time of forming grains in desalting process at chemical sensitization or before coating it is preferred to make the salt of a metal ion exist according to purpose. The salt of a metal ion is preferably added at the time of grain formation in the case where grains are doped and is added after forming grains and before termination of chemical sensitization in the case where grain surface is modified or the salt of a metal ion is used as a chemical sensitizer. As described above the whole grain may be doped or the core part of a grain may be doped or the shell part of a grain may be doped or an epitaxial part alone may be doped. For example Mg Ca Sr Ba Al Sc Y La Cr Mn Fe Co Ni Cu Zn Ga Ru Rh Pd Re Os Ir Pt Au Cd Hg Ti In Sn Pb and Bi can be used. These metals can be added so longer as they take the form of salts capable of being dissolved at the time of grain formation such as ammonium salt acetate nitrate sulfate phosphate hydroxy acid salt 6 coordinate complex salt or 4 coordinate complex salt. For example CdBr CdCl Cd NO Pb NO Pb CHCOO K Fe CN H Fe CN KIrCl NH RhCl and KRu CN are exemplified. The ligand of coordination compound can be selected from among halo aquo cyano cyanate thiocyanate nitrosyl thionitrosyl oxo and carbonyl. Metal compounds can be used alone or two or three or more may be used in combination.

It is preferred for metal compounds to be added by being dissolved in water or a proper organic solvent such as methanol or acetone. For the stabilization of the solution a method of adding an aqueous solution of hydrogen halide e.g. HCl HBr or alkali halide e.g. KCl NaCl KBr NaBr can be used. Further acid or alkali may be added if necessary. Metal compounds can be put into a reaction vessel before forming grains or may be added during forming rains. Metal compounds can also be added to water soluble silver salt e.g. AgNO or an aqueous solution of alkali halide e.g. NaCl KBr KI and continuously added during forming silver halide grain. Further a solution independent from an aqueous solution of water soluble silver salt or alkali halide may be prepared and continuously added at proper time during grain formation. It is also preferred to combine various addition methods.

There are cases where a method of adding a chalcogen compound during preparation of grains as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3 772 031 is useful. Cyanogen salt thiocyanogen salt selenocyanate carbonate phosphate acetate may be present besides S Se and Te.

The silver halide grains for use in the invention can be subjected to at least any one of sulfur sensitization selenium sensitization tellurium sensitization gold sensitization palladium sensitization noble metal sensitization and reduction sensitization in an arbitrary process of the manufacturing processes of a silver halide emulsion. It is preferred to use two or more kinds of sensitization methods in combination. Depending upon the process wherein silver halide grains are chemically sensitized various types of emulsions can be prepared. There are emulsions of a type having a chemically sensitized speck buried inside a grain of a type having a chemically sensitized speck buried at the shallow place from the surface of a grain and of a type having a chemically sensitized speck formed on the surface of a grain. The emulsion for use in the invention can select the place of a chemically sensitized speck according to purposes. An emulsion having formed at least one chemically sensitized speck in the vicinity of the surface of a grain is generally preferred.

In tellurium sensitization labile tellurium compounds are used and the labile tellurium compounds disclosed in JP A 4 224595 JP A 4 271341 JP A 4 333043 JP A 5 303157 Japanese Patent Application Nos. 4 185004 4 330495 4 333030 5 4203 5 4204 5 106977 and 5 286916 can be used.

Specifically it will be sufficient for tellurium sensitization to use phosphine tellurides e.g. butyl diisopropylphosphine telluride tributylphosphine telluride tributoxyphosphine telluride ethoxydiphenylphosphine telluride diacyl di tellurides e.g. bis diphenyl carbamoyl ditelluride bis N phenyl N methylcarbamoyl ditelluride bis N phenyl N methylcarbamoyl telluride bis N phenyl N benzylcarbamoyl telluride bis ethoxy carbonyl telluride telluroureas e.g. N N dimethyl ethylenetellurourea N N diphenylethylenetellurourea telluroamides and telluro esters.

As useful chemical sensitizer assistants compounds known to restrain fog during chemical sensitization and increase sensitivity such as azaindene azapyridazine and azapyrimidine are used. The examples of chemical sensitizer assistant modifiers are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2 131 038 3 411 914 3 554 757 JP A 58 126526 and G. F. Duffin Photographic Emulsion Chemistry pp. 138 to 143.

The amount of gold sensitizers and chalcogen sensitizers for use in the invention varies according to the silver halide grains used and the conditions of chemical sensitization but the amount is preferably from 10to 10mol per mol of the silver halide and more preferably from 10to 10mol or so.

The conditions of chemical sensitization in the invention are not especially restricted but pAg is preferably from 6 to 11 more preferably from 7 to 10 pH is preferably from 4 to 10 more preferably from 5 to 8 and temperature is preferably from 40 to 95 C. and more preferably from 45 to 85 C.

It is preferred to use an oxidizing agent to silver during the manufacture of emulsion. The oxidizing agent to silver means a compound having function of capable of acting on a metallic silver to convert it to a silver ion. Compounds capable of converting very minute silver grains by produced in the forming process of silver halide grains and a chemical sensitization process into silver ions are particularly effective. The silver ions formed may be hardly water soluble silver salts such as silver halide silver sulfide and silver selenide or easily water soluble silver salts such as silver nitrate. The oxidizing agent to silver may be inorganic or organic. The examples of inorganic oxidizing agents include e.g. ozone hydrogen peroxide and adducts thereof e.g. NaBO.HO.3HO 2NaCO.3HO NaPO.2HO 2NaSO.HO.2HO peroxy acid salts e.g. KSO KCO KPO peroxy complex compounds e.g. K Ti O CO .3HO 4KSO.Ti O OH.SO.2HO Na VO O CH 6HO permanganates e.g. KMnO oxyacid salts such as chromates e.g. KCrO halogen elements e.g. iodine and bromine halogen peracid salt e.g. potassium periodate the salts of high valency metals e.g. potassium hexacyanoferrate III and thiosulfonate.

The examples of organic oxidizing agents include quinones e.g. p quinone organic peroxides e.g. peracetic acid and perbenzoic acid and compounds releasing activated halogen e.g. N bromosuccinimide chloramine T and chloramine B .

The oxidizing agents preferably used in the invention are inorganic oxidizing agents such as ozone hydrogen peroxide and adducts thereof halogen elements and thiosulfonate and organic oxidizing agents such as quinones. It is preferred to use in combination of the reduction sensitization with the oxidizing agents to silver. Reduction sensitization may be performed after using oxidizing agents or ice versa or both may coincide with each other. These methods can be used selectively in a grain forming process or a chemical sensitization process.

The photographic emulsion for use in the invention can contain various compounds for the purpose of preventing fogging and stabilizing photographic performances in the process of manufacturing during preservation or photographic processing of a photographic material. That is many compounds know as antifoggants and stabilizers can be added to the photographic emulsion such as thiazoles e.g. benzothiazolium salt nitroimidazoles nitrobenzimidazoles chlorobenzimidazoles bromobenzimidazoles mercaptothiazoles mercaptobenzo thiazoles mercaptobenzimidazoles mercaptothiadiazoles aminotriazoles benzotriazoles nitrobenzotriazoles mercaptotetrazoles in particular 1 phenyl 5 mercapto tetrazole mercaptopyrimidines mercaptotriazines thioketo compounds e.g. oxazolinethione azaindenes e.g. triazaindenes tetraazaindenes in particular 4 hydroxy substituted 1 3 3a 7 tetraazaindenes and pentaazaindenes. For example the compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 954 474 3 982 947 and JP B 52 28660 can be used. As one preferred compound the compound disclosed in JP A 63 212932 is exemplified. Antifoggants and stabilizers can be added at various times according to purposes e.g. before grain formation during grain formation after grain formation in a water washing process at the time of dispersion after water washing before chemical sensitization during chemical sensitization after chemical sensitization and before coating. In addition to manifestations of original prevention of fogging and stabilization effect by the addition during preparation of emulsion antifoggants and stabilizers can be used for various purposes such as controlling the crystal habits of grains lessening a grain size reducing the solubility of grains restraining chemical sensitization controlling the arrangement of dyestuffs and the like.

It is preferred for the photographic emulsion for use in the invention to be spectrally sensitized with methine dyestuffs and the like in view of revealing the effect of the intention. The dyestuffs that are used include cyanine dyestuffs merocyanine dyestuffs complex cyanine dyestuffs complex merocyanine dyestuffs holopolar cyanine dyestuffs hemicyanine dyestuffs styryl dyestuffs and hemioxonol dyestuffs. Especially useful dyestuffs are dyestuffs belonging to cyanine dyestuffs merocyanine dyestuffs and complex merocyanine dyestuffs. Every nucleus of basic heterocyclic nuclei generally used in cyanine dyestuffs can be applied to these dyestuffs. That is e.g. a pyrroline nucleus an oxazoline nucleus a thiazoline nucleus a pyrrole nucleus an oxazole nucleus a thiazole nucleus a selenazole nucleus an imidazole nucleus a tetrazole nucleus a pyridine nucleus nuclei obtained by condensing an alicyclic hydrocarbon ring on these nuclei and nuclei obtained by condensing an aromatic hydrocarbon ring on these nuclei e.g. an indolenine nucleus a benzindolenine nucleus an indole nucleus a benzoxazole nucleus a naphthoxazole nucleus a benzothiazole nucleus a naphthothiazole nucleus a benzoselenazole nucleus a benzimidazole nucleus and a quinoline nucleus can be applied. These nuclei may have a substituent on the carbon atoms.

As the nuclei having a ketomethylene structure 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic nuclei e.g. a pyrazolin 5 one nucleus a thiohydantoin nucleus a 2 thiooxazolidine 2 4 dione nucleus a thiazolidine 2 4 dione nucleus a rhodanine nucleus a thiobarbituric acid nucleus can be applied to merocyanine dyestuffs or complex merocyanine dyestuffs.

These sensitizing dyestuffs may be used alone or may be used in combination and combination of sensitizing dyestuffs is often used for the purpose of supersensitization. The representative examples thereof are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2 688 545 2 977 229 3 397 060 3 522 052 3 527 641 3 617 293 3 628 964 3 666 480 6712898 3 679 428 3 703 377 3 769 301 3 814 609 3 837 862 4 026 707 British Patents 1 344 281 1 507 803 JP B 43 4936. JP B 53 12 375. JP A 52 110618 and JP A 52 109925.

There may be contained in an emulsion together with sensitizing dyestuffs a dyestuff having no spectral sensitizing action by itself or a material not substantially absorbing visible rays but showing supersensitization. The time of addition of sensitizing dyestuffs to an emulsion may be at any stage of the preparation of the emulsion recognized as useful hitherto. Sensitizing dyestuffs are most generally added during the period after termination of chemical sensitization and before coating but as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 628 969 and 4 225 666 they may be added at the same time with a chemical sensitizer and spectral sensitization may be performed simultaneously with chemical sensitization. Alternatively as disclosed in JP A 58 113928 spectral sensitization can be carried out prior chemical sensitization and it is also possible to add sensitizing dyestuffs before completion of precipitation formation of silver halide grains to initiate spectral sensitization. Further as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 225 666 sensitizing dyestuffs can be divided and added separately for example one part is added prior to chemical sensitization and the remaining after completion of chemical sensitization and they may be added in any stage of silver halide grain formation including the method disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 183 756. The addition amount of sensitizing dyestuffs is from 4 10to 8 10mol per mol of the silver halide.

It is sufficient that photographic materials to which the method of the invention is applicable have at least one blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer at least one green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer at least one red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer and a photo insensitive layer on a support. A representative example is a silver halide photographic material comprising a support having thereon photosensitive layers of blue sensitive green sensitive and red sensitive layers of a plurality of silver halide emulsion layers having substantially the same color sensitivity and different in photosensitivity and at least one photo insensitive layer. The photosensitive layers are unit photosensitive layers having color sensitivity to any of blue light green light and red light. In a multilayer silver halide color photographic material the unit photo sensitive layers are generally arranged in the order of a red sensitive layer a green sensitive layer and a blue sensitive layer from the support side. However the order of arrangement can be reversed depending upon purposes alternatively the photosensitive layers may be arranged in such a way that a layer having different photosensitivity is interposed between layers having the same color sensitivity. Photo insensitive layers may be provided between and on the uppermost layer and beneath the lowermost layer of the silver halide photosensitive layers. These photo insensitive layers may contain the couplers DIR compounds and color mixing preventives described later. As the plurality of silver halide emulsion layers constituting each unit photosensitive layer a two layer structure of a high sensitivity emulsion layer and a low sensitivity emulsion layer can be preferably used with the emulsion layers being arranged so as to decrease in sensitivity toward the support in turn as disclosed in German Patent 1 121 470 and British Patent 923 045. In addition a low sensitivity emulsion layer may be provided farther from the support and a high sensitivity emulsion layer may be provided nearer to the support as disclosed in JP A 57 112751 JP A 62 200350 JP A 62 206541 and JP A 62 206543.

As a specific example a low sensitivity blue sensitive layer BL a high sensitivity blue sensitive layer BH a high sensitivity green sensitive layer GH a low sensitivity green sensitive layer GL a high sensitivity red sensitive layer RH a low sensitivity red sensitive layer RL or BH BL GL GH RH RL or BH BL GH GL RL RH can be arranged in this order from the side farthest from the support.

As disclosed in JP B 55 34932 a blue sensitive layer GH RH GL RL can be arranged in this order from the side farthest from the support. Further a blue sensitive layer GL RL GH RH can be arranged in this order from the side farthest from the support as disclosed in JP A 56 25738 and JP A 62 63936.

Further arrangements include the arrangement in which there are three layers having different degrees of sensitivities with the sensitivity being lower towards the support such that the uppermost layer is a silver halide emulsion layer having the highest sensitivity the middle layer is a silver halide emulsion layer having a lower sensitivity than that of the uppermost layer and the lowermost layer is a silver halide emulsion layer having a lower sensitivity than that of the middle layer as disclosed in JP B 49 15495. In the case of the structure of this type comprising three layers having different degrees of sensitivities the layers in the unit layer of the same color sensitivity may be arranged in the order of a middle sensitivity emulsion layer a high sensitivity emulsion layer a low sensitivity emulsion layer from the side farthest from the support as disclosed in JP A 59 202464.

Alternatively the layers can be arranged in the order of a high sensitivity emulsion layer a low sensitivity emulsion layer a middle sensitivity emulsion layer or a low sensitivity emulsion layer a middle sensitivity emulsion layer a high sensitivity emulsion layer.

Moreover the arrangement may be varied as indicated above in the case where there are four or more layers.

A silver halide photographic material for use in the method of the invention comprises a transparent support having provided thereon at least one blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer at least one green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer and at least one red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer and it is preferred that at least one layer that is a layer on the opposite side to the support with the green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer as the center and not the green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer contains a fixed magenta dye and or at least one layer that is a layer on the side of the support with the green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer as the center and not the green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer contains a fixed magenta dye and it is also preferred that at least one layer that is a layer on the opposite side to die support with the red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer as the center and not the red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer contains a fixed cyan dye.

Further in a silver halide photographic material comprising a transparent support having provided thereon at least one blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer at least one green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer and at least one red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer it is also preferred that at least one layer that is a layer on the opposite side to the support with the red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer as the center and not the red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer contains a fixed cyan dye.

In the photographic material of the invention two or more types of emulsions that are different in terms of at least one of the characteristics of grain size grain size distribution halide composition shape of the grains and sensitivity of the photosensitive silver halide emulsion can be used in admixture in one and the same layer.

It is preferred to use the silver halide grains having a fogged grain surface as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 082 553 the silver halide grains having a fogged grain interior as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 626 498 and JP A 59 214852 or colloidal silver in photosensitive silver halide emulsion layers and or substantially photo insensitive hydrophilic colloid layers. Silver halide grains having a fogged grain interior or surface are silver halide grains that can be developed uniformly not imagewise irrespective of whether these grains are in an unexposed area or an exposed area of the photographic material and methods of the preparation of these silver halide grains are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 626 498 and JP A 59 214852. The silver halide that forms the internal nuclei of core shell type silver halide grains having a forged grain interior may have different halide compositions. The silver halide having a fogged grain interior or surface may be any of silver chloride silver bromide silver iodobromide or silver chloroiodobromide. Further the form of the grains may be regular grains and may be a polydispersed emulsion but a monodispersed emulsion at least 95 of which have a grain size within 40 of the average equivalent sphere diameter in terms of the mass or number of silver halide grains is preferred.

It is preferred to use photo insensitive fine grained silver halides in the invention. Photo insensitive fine grained silver halides are fine grained silver halides that are not sensitive to light upon imagewise exposure for obtaining color images and do not substantially undergo development in development processing and they are preferably not pre fogged. The content of silver bromide of fine grained silver halides is from 0 to 100 mol and at least one of silver chloride and silver iodide may be contained if necessary. Fine grained silver halides having a silver iodide content of from 0.5 to 10 mol are preferred.

Fine grained silver halide can be prepared by the same methods as the preparation of generally used photosensitive silver halides. In the preparation of fine grained silver halide the surfaces of the silver halide grains may be or may not be spectrally or chemically sensitized.

Sharpness is evaluated as to the negative images and sharpness and color saturation as to the positive images by the following seven grades and the values of evaluation by twenty panelists are averaged.

Gray sensitometry exposure is carried out with red green and blue lasers and the samples are preserved at 30 C. 70 for 1 hour and 20 hours respectively. After the above development process is performed magenta density is measured. The magenta density measured is the density of Dmin 0.2 and variation widths in 1 hour and 20 hours are measured.

From the results in Table A it is known that silver halide photographic materials excellent in sharpness and little in fluctuation of latent image conservation can be obtained in laser recording a digital image data by using silver halide emulsion grains having an average equivalent sphere diameter of 0.35 m or less fixed magenta dyes according to the invention and the couplers according to the invention. Further silver halide photographic materials showing more excellent sharpness can be obtained by further combining the dyestuffs and compounds according to the invention.

To record a digital image of high pixel number such as the number of pixels of 2 041 1 556 in a limited image plane size for example 0.8 0.6 inches 45.2 mm 20.3 mm has conventionally been a main cause of the degradation of image quality ascribable to the deterioration of sharpness in recording on silver halide photographic materials. However sharpness can be conspicuously improved by combining each technique as above. In addition change in tint that conventionally arises during recording on account of the degradation of latent images can also be restrained at the same time. As a result according to the invention it has been possible to provide images of high quality by making use of digital images of high pixel number that has been completely impossible.

The same experiment as in Example 1 is made by changing the cellulose triacetate film support to a polyethylene terephthalate support as described below to obtain the same results as in Example 1. Since the support has an antistatic layer remaining even after processing dusts hardly adhere to the photographic material at the time of printing and preferable in the point of practicability.

A polyethylene terephthalate film PET film having a thickness of 125 m is prepared by biaxial orientation 3.3 times both in length and width and thermal fixation at 240 C. for 10 minutes and then corona discharge treatment on both surfaces.

Both surfaces of the polyethylene terephthalate support having a thickness of 125 nm are subjected to ultraviolet UV irradiation treatment and an adhesive layer having the composition shown below is provided on the emulsion layer side. The coating amount is 10 ml m. Ultraviolet irradiation is performed according to the method disclosed in the example of JP B 45 3828.

The coating solution of a first backing layer of the prescription shown below is coated simultaneously with the undercoat layer.

A homogeneous solution is prepared by dissolving 230 weight parts of stannic chloride hydrate and 23 weight parts of antimony trichloride in 3 000 weight parts of ethanol. A 1N sodium hydroxide aqueous solution is dropped to the above solution until the solution reaches pH of 3 to thereby obtain co precipitate of colloidal stannic oxide and antimony oxide. The obtained co precipitate is allowed to stand at 50 C. for 24 hours to obtain red brownish colloidal precipitate. The red brownish colloidal precipitate is separated by centrifugation. For removing excessive ions water is added to the precipitate to wash by centrifugation. This operation is repeated three times to remove excessive ions. Colloidal precipitate 200 weight parts from which excessive ions are removed is re dispersed in 1 500 weight parts of water sprayed to a kiln heated at 500 C. to obtain bluish fine particles of the composite of stannic oxide and antimony oxide having an average particle size or 0.005 m. The resistivity of the fine particle powder is 25 cm. A mixed solution comprising 40 weight parts of the fine particle powder and 60 weight parts of water having pH of 7.0 is prepared crudely dispersed with a stirrer and then dispersed with a horizontal sand mill DYNO MILL manufactured by Willy A. Backfen AG until the residence time of 30 minutes to obtain dispersion comprising secondary agglomerates of partial agglomeration of primary particles having a particle size of 0.05 m.

A solution of the prescription shown below is coated in a dry film thickness of 0.2 m and dried at 110 C. for 30 seconds.

A solution having the prescription shown below is coated in a dry film thickness of 0.42 m and dried at 70 C.

For the problem of deterioration of images recorded on an intermediate film a silver halide photographic material analog images using negative films for photographing alone can be conventionally used as original images. However according to the invention it has become possible to use digital images as original images. That is even when digital images are used as original images images recorded on an intermediate film a silver halide photographic material according to the invention are free from occurrence of blur deterioration of sharpness and degradation of color reproduction and conservation stability of latent images can be secured. Further according to the invention it becomes possible to manufacture movies positively getting digital image data which contributes to further development of cinema industry.
