This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Applications Nos. 60 889 214 filed Feb. 9 2007 and 60 891 475 filed Feb. 23 2007 the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.

The present invention relates generally to the fields of angiogenesis and endothelial cell proliferation and migration. More specifically the invention concerns modulators of Robo4 and uses of such modulators.

The Roundabout family of receptors are molecular guidance molecules which regulate axon guidance neuronal migration and leukocyte chemotaxis in response to interaction with Slit proteins Suchting et al. 19 121 123 2005 . Roundabout receptor molecules contain five immunoglobulin and three fibronectin domains in their extracellular region. Magic Roundabout i.e. Robo4 or endothelial cell specific molecule 4 ESCSM4 is structurally distinct from other roundabout family members. Human Magic Roundabout Robo4 comprises two immunoglobulin and major histocompatibility complex domains amino acids 46 116 and 151 209 two fibronectin type III domains amino acids 252 335 and 347 432 a transmembrane region 468 490 and a proline rich region amino acids 715 772 see Huminiecki et al. 79 4 547 552 2002 and FIG. 1 therein . Mouse and human Robo4 show 75 nucleotide sequence identity Huminiecki et al. supra 2002 .

Robo4 expression analysis indicated that Robo4 expression is highly restricted with strong expression in placenta and tumors including brain bladder and colonic metastasis to the liver where tumor expression is restricted to tumor vasculature Huminiecki et al. supra 2002 . In addition Robo4 expression is associated with sites of active angiogenesis but is not detected in neuronal tissue Huminiecki L. et al. supra 2002 .

As a membrane associated receptor with extracellular domains Robo4 is a useful target for delivering cytotoxic therapeutics for inhibition of vascular endothelial cell proliferation during angiogenesis. Robo4 is also a useful target to delivery of detectable markers to proliferating vascular endothelial cells. Antibody conjugates targeted to Robo4 also referred to as ECSM4 have also been reported as potential therapeutic compounds where the conjugate comprises a cytotoxin and as potential diagnostic markers where the conjugate comprises a detectable label see for example WO 2002036771 .

The use of antibody drug conjugates for the local delivery of cytotoxic or cytostatic agents i.e. drugs to kill or inhibit tumor cells in the treatment of cancer Syrigos and Epenetos 19 605 614 1999 Niculescu Duvaz and Springer 26 151 172 1997 U.S. Pat. No. 4 975 278 allows targeted delivery of the drug moiety to tumors and intracellular accumulation of the drugs.

A number of antibody drug conjugates that target other molecules have been or are being developed.

Although ZEVALIN has activity against B cell non Hodgkin s Lymphoma NHL administration results in severe and prolonged cytopenias in most patients. MYLOTARG gemtuzumab ozogamicin Wyeth Pharmaceuticals composed of a huCD33 antibody linked to calicheamicin was approved in 2000 for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia by injection Drugs of the Future 2000 25 7 686 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 970 198 5 079 233 5 585 089 5 606 040 5 693 762 5 739 116 5 767 285 5 773 001 . Cantuzumab mertansine Immunogen Inc. composed of a huC242 antibody linked via the disulfide linker SPP to the maytansinoid drug moiety DM1 is being developed for the treatment of cancers that express CanAg antigen such as colon pancreatic gastric and others. MLN 2704 Millennium Pharm. BZL Biologics Immunogen Inc. composed of an anti prostate specific membrane antigen PSMA monoclonal antibody linked to the maytansinoid drug moiety DM1 is being developed for the potential treatment of prostate tumors. The same maytansinoid drug moiety DM1 was linked through a non disulfide noncleavable linker SMCC to a mouse murine monoclonal antibody TA.1 Chari et al. 52 127 131 1992 . This conjugate was reported to be 200 fold less potent than the corresponding disulfide linker conjugate.

As used herein the following terms have the meanings ascribed to them below unless otherwise specified.

The term Robo4 or Magic Roundabout Endothelial Cell Specific Molecule 4 or ECSM4 as used herein refers to any native or variant whether native or synthetic Robo4 polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence shown in a variant or a subsequence thereof to which the antibody of the present invention specifically binds including e.g. the extracellular domain of Robo4 or any subsequence thereof. The term wild type Robo4 generally refers to a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring Robo4 protein. The term wild type Robo4 sequence generally refers to an amino acid sequence found in a naturally occurring Robo4. The Robo4 polypeptide of the invention is a mammalian Robo4 polypeptide such as without limitation human equine bovine porcine canine feline rodent Robo4. Robo4 Magic Roundabout Endothelial Cell Specific Molecule 4 or ECSM4 also refer to nucleic acids and polypeptide polymorphic variants alleles mutants and interspecies homologs that 1 have an amino acid sequence that has greater than about 60 amino acid sequence identity 65 70 75 80 85 90 preferably 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 or 99 or greater amino acid sequence identity preferably over a region of at least about 25 50 100 200 500 1000 or more amino acids to an amino acid sequence encoded by a Robo4 nucleic acid for a human Robo4 polypeptide sequence see e.g. and SEQ ID NOS 138 and 171 for a murine Robo4 polypeptide sequence see e.g. SEQ ID NO 172 2 bind to antibodies e.g. polyclonal antibodies and or monoclonal antibodies raised against an immunogen comprising an amino acid sequence of a Robo4 protein and conservatively modified variants thereof 3 specifically hybridize under stringent hybridization conditions to an anti sense strand corresponding to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a Robo4 protein and conservatively modified variants thereof 4 have a nucleic acid sequence that has greater than about 95 preferably greater than about 96 97 98 99 or higher nucleotide sequence identity preferably over a region of at least about 25 50 100 200 500 1000 or more nucleotides to a Robo4 nucleic acid e.g. a nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide set forth in and SEQ ID NOS 138 171 or 172. Preferably the Robo4 nucleic acid has greater than 80 85 90 95 96 97 98 or 99 identity to the nucleic acid sequence encoding SEQ ID NOS 138 171 or 172 preferably over a region of at least about 25 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 or 500 600 700 800 900 or 1000 or more nucleotides.

The term anti Robo4 antibody or an antibody that binds to Robo4 refers to an antibody that is capable of binding Robo4 with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful as a diagnostic and or therapeutic agent in targeting Robo4. Preferably the extent of binding of an anti Robo4 antibody to an unrelated non Robo4 protein is less than about 10 of the binding of the antibody to Robo4 as measured e.g. by a radioimmunoassay RIA . In certain embodiments an antibody that binds to Robo4 has a dissociation constant Kd of 1 M 100 nM 10 nM 1 nM or 0.1 nM. In certain embodiments an anti Robo4 antibody binds to an epitope of Robo4 that is conserved among Robo4 from different species. In other embodiments an ant Robo4 antibody binds to an epitope of Robo4 that is not conserved among Robo4 from different species.

The term antibody herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies polyclonal antibodies multispecific antibodies e.g. bispecific antibodies formed from at least two intact antibodies and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity.

An isolated antibody is one which has been identified and separated and or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with research diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody and may include enzymes hormones and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In some embodiments an antibody is purified 1 to greater than 95 by weight of antibody as determined by for example the Lowry method and in some embodiments to greater than 99 by weight 2 to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of for example a spinning cup sequenator or 3 to homogeneity by SDS PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using for example Coomassie blue or silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody s natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily however isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.

 Native antibodies are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150 000 daltons composed of two identical light L chains and two identical heavy H chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond while the number of disulfide linkages varies among the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain V followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end V and a constant domain at its other end the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains.

The variable region or variable domain of an antibody refers to the amino terminal domains of the heavy or light chain of the antibody. The variable domain of the heavy chain may be referred to as VH. The variable domain of the light chain may be referred to as VL. These domains are generally the most variable parts of an antibody and contain the antigen binding sites.

The term variable refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called hypervariable regions HVRs both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework regions FR . The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions largely adopting a beta sheet configuration connected by three HVRs which form loops connecting and in some cases forming part of the beta sheet structure. The HVRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and with the HVRs from the other chain contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies see Kabat et al. Fifth Edition National Institute of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . The constant domains are not involved directly in the binding of an antibody to an antigen but exhibit various effector functions such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular toxicity.

The light chains of antibodies immunoglobulins from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types called kappa and lambda based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.

Depending on the amino acid sequences of the constant domains of their heavy chains antibodies immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins IgA IgD IgE IgG and IgM and several of these may be further divided into subclasses isotypes e.g. IgG IgG IgG IgG IgA and IgA. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called and respectively. The subunit structures and three dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known and described generally in for example Abbas et al. 4th ed. W.B. Saunders Co. 2000 . An antibody may be part of a larger fusion molecule formed by covalent or non covalent association of the antibody with one or more other proteins or peptides.

The terms full length antibody intact antibody and whole antibody are used herein interchangeably to refer to an antibody in its substantially intact form not antibody fragments as defined below. The terms particularly refer to an antibody with heavy chains that contain an Fc region.

A naked antibody for the purposes herein is an antibody that is not conjugated to a cytotoxic moiety or radiolabel.

 Antibody fragments comprise a portion of an intact antibody preferably comprising the antigen binding region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab Fab F ab and Fv fragments diabodies linear antibodies single chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.

Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen binding fragments called Fab fragments each with a single antigen binding site and a residual Fc fragment whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F ab fragment that has two antigen combining sites and is still capable of cross linking antigen.

 Fv is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen binding site. In one embodiment a two chain Fv species consists of a dimer of one heavy and one light chain variable domain in tight non covalent association. In a single chain Fv scFv species one heavy and one light chain variable domain can be covalently linked by a flexible peptide linker such that the light and heavy chains can associate in a dimeric structure analogous to that in a two chain Fv species. It is in this configuration that the three HVRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen binding site on the surface of the VH VL dimer. Collectively the six HVRs confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However even a single variable domain or half of an Fv comprising only three HVRs specific for an antigen has the ability to recognize and bind antigen although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.

The Fab fragment contains the heavy and light chain variable domains and also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain CH1 of the heavy chain. Fab fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab SH is the designation herein for Fab in which the cysteine residue s of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F ab antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.

 Single chain Fv or scFv antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL domains of antibody wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally the scFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv see e.g. Pluckth n in vol. 113 Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer Verlag New York 1994 pp. 269 315.

The term diabodies refers to antibody fragments with two antigen binding sites which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain VH connected to a light chain variable domain VL in the same polypeptide chain VH VL . By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen binding sites. Diabodies may be bivalent or bispecific. Diabodies are described more fully in for example EP 404 097 WO 1993 01161 Hudson et al. 9 129 134 2003 and Hollinger et al. 90 6444 6448 1993 . Triabodies and tetrabodies are also described in Hudson et al. 9 129 134 2003 .

The term monoclonal antibody as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible mutations e.g. naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Thus the modifier monoclonal indicates the character of the antibody as not being a mixture of discrete antibodies. In certain embodiments such a monoclonal antibody typically includes an antibody comprising a polypeptide sequence that binds a target wherein the target binding polypeptide sequence was obtained by a process that includes the selection of a single target binding polypeptide sequence from a plurality of polypeptide sequences. For example the selection process can be the selection of a unique clone from a plurality of clones such as a pool of hybridoma clones phage clones or recombinant DNA clones. It should be understood that a selected target binding sequence can be further altered for example to improve affinity for the target to humanize the target binding sequence to improve its production in cell culture to reduce its immunogenicity in vivo to create a multispecific antibody etc. and that an antibody comprising the altered target binding sequence is also a monoclonal antibody of this invention. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants epitopes each monoclonal antibody of a monoclonal antibody preparation is directed against a single determinant on an antigen. In addition to their specificity monoclonal antibody preparations are advantageous in that they are typically uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins.

The modifier monoclonal indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques including for example the hybridoma method e.g. Kohler and Milstein 256 495 97 1975 Hongo et al. 14 3 253 260 1995 Harlow et al. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 2nd ed. 1988 Hammerling et al. in 563 681 Elsevier N.Y. 1981 recombinant DNA methods see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 phage display technologies see e.g. Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 Marks et al. 222 581 597 1992 Sidhu et al. 338 2 299 310 2004 Lee et al. 340 5 1073 1093 2004 Fellouse 101 34 12467 12472 2004 and Lee et al. 284 1 2 119 132 2004 and technologies for producing human or human like antibodies in animals that have parts or all of the human immunoglobulin loci or genes encoding human immunoglobulin sequences see e.g. WO 1998 24893 WO 1996 34096 WO 1996 33735 WO 1991 10741 Jakobovits et al. 90 2551 1993 Jakobovits et al. 362 255 258 1993 Bruggemann et al. 7 33 1993 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 545 807 5 545 806 5 569 825 5 625 126 5 633 425 and 5 661 016 Marks et al 10 779 783 1992 Lonberg et al. 368 856 859 1994 Morrison 368 812 813 1994 Fishwild et al. 14 845 851 1996 Neuberger 14 826 1996 and Lonberg and Huszar 13 65 93 1995 .

The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include chimeric antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while the remainder of the chain s is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass as well as fragments of such antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al. 81 6851 6855 1984 . Chimeric antibodies include PRIMATIZED antibodies wherein the antigen binding region of the antibody is derived from an antibody produced by e.g. immunizing macaque monkeys with the antigen of interest.

 Humanized forms of non human e.g. murine antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulin. For the most part humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins recipient antibody in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity affinity and capacity. In some instances framework region FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues. Furthermore humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details see Jones et al. 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. 332 323 329 1988 and Presta 2 593 596 1992 .

A human antibody is one which possesses an amino acid sequence which corresponds to that of an antibody produced by a human and or has been made using any of the techniques for making human antibodies as disclosed herein. This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non human antigen binding residues. Human antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the art including phage display libraries. Hoogenboom and Winter 227 381 1991 Marks et al. 222 581 1991 .

An acceptor human framework for the purposes herein is a framework comprising the amino acid sequence of a VL or VH framework derived from a human immunoglobulin framework or from a human consensus framework. An acceptor human framework derived from a human immunoglobulin framework or human consensus framework may comprise the same amino acid sequence thereof or may contain pre existing amino acid sequence changes. In some embodiments the number of pre existing amino acid changes are 10 or less 9 or less 8 or less 7 or less 6 or less 5 or less 4 or less 3 or less or 2 or less. Where pre existing amino acid changes are present in a VH preferably those changes occur at only three two or one of positions 71H 73H and 78H for instance the amino acid residues at those positions may be 71A 73T and or 78A.

In one embodiment the VL acceptor human framework is identical in sequence to the VL human immunoglobulin framework sequence or human consensus framework sequence.

A human consensus framework is a framework which represents the most commonly occurring amino acid residue in a selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH framework sequences. Generally the selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH sequences is from a subgroup of variable domain sequences. Generally the subgroup of sequences is a subgroup as in Kabat et al. In one embodiment for the VL the subgroup is subgroup kappa I as in Kabat et al. In one embodiment for the VH the subgroup is subgroup III as in Kabat et al.

An unmodified human framework is a human framework which has the same amino acid sequence as the acceptor human framework e.g. lacking human to non human amino acid substitution s in the acceptor human framework.

The term hypervariable region HVR or HV when used herein refers to the regions of an antibody variable domain which are hypervariable in sequence and or form structurally defined loops. Generally antibodies comprise six hypervariable regions three in the VH H1 H2 H3 and three in the VL L1 L2 L3 . A number of hypervariable region delineations are in use and are encompassed herein. The Kabat Complementarity Determining Regions CDRs are HVRs that are based on sequence variability and are the most commonly used Kabat et al. 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . Chothia refers instead to the location of the structural loops Chothia and Lesk 196 901 917 1987 . The AbM hypervariable regions represent a compromise between the Kabat CDRs and Chothia structural loops and are used by Oxford Molecular s AbM antibody modeling software. The contact hypervariable regions are based on an analysis of the available complex crystal structures. The residues from each of these hypervariable regions are noted below.

The amino acid position boundary delineating a hypervariable region of an antibody can vary depending on the context and the various definitions known in the art as described below . Some positions within a variable domain may be viewed as hybrid hypervariable positions in that these positions can be deemed to be within a hypervariable region under one set of criteria while being deemed to be outside a hypervariable region under a different set of criteria. One or more of these positions can also be found in extended hypervariable regions. In one embodiment these hybrid hypervariable positions include one or more of positions 26 30 26 35 33 35B 47 49 49 65 57 65 95 102 93 94 and 102 in a heavy chain variable domain. In one embodiment these hybrid hypervariable positions include one or more of positions 24 29 24 34 35 36 46 49 50 56 89 97 56 and 97 in a light chain variable domain.

As used herein the HVRs of the light chain are referred to interchangeably as HVR L1 L2 or L3 or HVR1 LC HVR2 LC or HVR3 LC or other similar designation that indicates that a light chain HVR is referenced. As used herein the HVRs of the heavy chain are referred to interchangeably as HVR H1 H2 or H3 or HVR1 HC HVR2 HC or HVR3 HC or other similar designation that indicates that a heavy chain HVR is referenced.

Hypervariable regions may comprise extended hypervariable regions as follows 24 36 or 24 34 L1 46 56 or 50 56 L2 and 89 97 L3 in the VL and 26 35 H1 50 65 or 49 65 H2 and 93 102 94 102 or 95 102 H3 in the VH. The variable domain residues are numbered according to Kabat et al. supra for each of these definitions.

An altered hypervariable region for the purposes herein is a hypervariable region comprising one or more e.g. one to about 16 amino acid substitution s therein.

An un modified hypervariable region for the purposes herein is a hypervariable region having the same amino acid sequence as a non human antibody from which it was derived i.e. one which lacks one or more amino acid substitutions therein.

 Framework or FR residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined. As used herein LC FR1 4 or FR1 4 LC or similar designation is used interchangeably and refers to framework regions of the light chain. As used herein HC FR1 4 or FR1 4 HC or similar designation is used interchangeably and refers to framework region of the heavy chain.

An affinity matured antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more CDRs thereof which result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those alteration s . Preferred affinity matured antibodies will have nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of CDR and or framework residues is described by Barbas et al. 91 3809 3813 1994 Schier et al. 169 147 155 1995 Yelton et al. 155 1994 2004 1995 Jackson et al. 154 7 3310 9 1995 and Hawkins et al 226 889 896 1992 .

A blocking antibody or an antagonist antibody is one which inhibits or reduces biological activity of the antigen it binds. For example blocking antibodies or antagonist anti Robo4 antibodies substantially or completely inhibit the angiogenesis by binding Robo4.

The term variable domain residue numbering as in Kabat or amino acid position numbering as in Kabat and variations thereof refers to the numbering system used for heavy chain variable domains or light chain variable domains of the compilation of antibodies in Kabat et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . Using this numbering system the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of or insertion into a FR or CDR of the variable domain. For example a heavy chain variable domain may include a single amino acid insert residue 52a according to Kabat after residue 52 of H2 and inserted residues e.g. residues 82a 82b and 82c etc according to Kabat after heavy chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a standard Kabat numbered sequence.

The phrase substantially similar or substantially the same as used herein denotes a sufficiently high degree of similarity between two numeric values generally one associated with an antibody of the invention and the other associated with a reference comparator antibody such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of little or no biological and or statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values e.g. Kd values . The difference between said two values is preferably less than about 50 preferably less than about 40 preferably less than about 30 preferably less than about 20 preferably less than about 10 as a function of the value for the reference comparator antibody.

 Binding affinity generally refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule e.g. an antibody and its binding partner e.g. an antigen . Unless indicated otherwise as used herein binding affinity refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1 1 interaction between members of a binding pair e.g. antibody and antigen . The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant K . Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art including those described herein. Low affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily whereas high affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art any of which can be used for purposes of the present invention. Specific illustrative embodiments are described in the following.

In one embodiment the K K or Kvalue is measured by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay RIA performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen as described by the following assay that measures solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of I labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen then capturing bound antigen with an anti Fab antibody coated plate Chen et al. 1999 293 865 881 . To establish conditions for the assay microtiter plates Dynex are coated overnight with 5 ug ml of a capturing anti Fab antibody Cappel Labs in 50 mM sodium carbonate pH 9.6 and subsequently blocked with 2 w v bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature approximately 23 C. . In a non adsorbant plate Nunc 269620 100 pM or 26 pM I antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest e.g. Fab 12 as described in Presta et al. 57 4593 4599 1997 . The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight however the incubation may continue for a longer period e.g. 65 hours to insure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature e.g. for one hour . The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1 Tween 20 in PBS. When the plates have dried 150 ul well of scintillant MicroScint 20 Packard is added and the plates are counted on a Topcount gamma counter Packard for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20 of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays. According to another embodiment the Kd or Kd value is measured by using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIAcore 2000 or a BIAcore 3000 BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. at 25 C. with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at 10 response units RU . Briefly carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips CM5 BIAcore Inc. are activated with N ethyl N 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride EDC and N hydroxysuccinimide NHS according to the supplier s instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.8 into 5 ug ml 0.2 uM before injection at a flow rate of 5 ul minute to achieve approximately 10 response units RU of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen 1M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements two fold serial dilutions of Fab 0.78 nM to 500 nM are injected in PBS with 0.05 Tween 20 PBST at 25 C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 ul min. Association rates k and dissociation rates k are calculated using a simple one to one Langmuir binding model BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2 by simultaneous fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. The equilibrium dissociation constant K is calculated as the ratio k k. See e.g. Chen et al. 293 865 881 1999 . If the on rate exceeds 10MSby the surface plasmon resonance assay above then the on rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity excitation 295 nm emission 340 nm 16 nm band pass at 25 C. of a 20 nM anti antigen antibody Fab form in PBS pH 7.2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer such as a stop flow equipped spectrophometer Aviv Instruments or a 8000 series SLM Aminco spectrophotometer ThermoSpectronic with a stirred cuvette.

The phrase substantially reduced or substantially different as used herein denotes a sufficiently high degree of difference between two numeric values generally one associated with an antibody of the invention and the other associated with a reference comparator antibody such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values e.g. Kvalues HAMA response . The difference between said two values is preferably greater than about 10 preferably greater than about 20 preferably greater than about 30 preferably greater than about 40 preferably greater than about 50 as a function of the value for the reference comparator antibody.

 Percent amino acid sequence identity with respect to a peptide or polypeptide sequence is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in the specific peptide or polypeptide sequence after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps if necessary to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art for instance using publicly available computer software such as BLAST BLAST 2 ALIGN or Megalign DNASTAR software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared. For purposes herein however amino acid sequence identity values are generated using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN 2. The ALIGN 2 sequence comparison computer program was authored by Genentech Inc. and the source code shown has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office Washington D.C. 20559 where it is registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The ALIGN 2 program is publicly available through Genentech Inc. South San Francisco Calif. The ALIGN 2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system preferably digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN 2 program and do not vary.

In situations where ALIGN 2 is employed for amino acid sequence comparisons the amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to with or against a given amino acid sequence B which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain amino acid sequence identity to with or against a given amino acid sequence B is calculated as follows 100 times the fraction X Y where X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN 2 in that program s alignment of A and B and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B the amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the amino acid sequence identity of B to A.

Unless specifically stated otherwise all amino acid sequence identity values used herein are obtained as described in the immediately preceding paragraph using the ALIGN 2 computer program.

Dysregulation of angiogenesis can lead to abnormal angiogenesis i.e. when excessive or inappropriate growth of new blood vessels e.g. the location timing or onset of the angiogenesis being undesired from a medical standpoint in a diseased state or such that it causes a diseased state. Excessive inappropriate or uncontrolled angiogenesis occurs when there is new blood vessel growth that contributes to the worsening of the diseased state or causes a diseased state. The new blood vessels can feed the diseased tissues destroy normal tissues and in the case of cancer the new vessels can allow tumor cells to escape into the circulation and lodge in other organs tumor metastases . Disease states involving abnormal angiogenesis include both non neoplastic and neoplastic conditions including e.g. cancer especially vascularized solid tumors and metastatic tumors including colon cancer breast cancer lung cancer especially small cell lung cancer or prostate cancer undesired or aberrant hypertrophy arthritis rheumatoid arthritis RA inflammatory bowel disease or IBD Crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis psoriasis psoriatic plaques sarcoidosis atherosclerosis atherosclerotic plaques diabetic and other proliferative retinopathies including retinopathy of prematurity retrolental fibroplasia neovascular glaucoma age related macular degeneration diabetic macular edema corneal neovascularization corneal graft neovascularization corneal graft rejection retinal choroidal neovascularization neovascularization of the anterior surface of the iris rubeosis ocular neovascular disease vascular restenosis arteriovenous malformations AVM meningioma hemangioma angiofibroma thyroid hyperplasias including Grave s disease chronic inflammation lung inflammation acute lung injury ARDS sepsis primary pulmonary hypertension malignant pulmonary effusions cerebral edema e.g. associated with acute stroke closed head injury trauma synovial inflammation myositis ossificans hypertropic bone formation osteoarthritis OA refractory ascites polycystic ovarian disease endometriosis 3rd spacing of fluid diseases pancreatitis compartment syndrome burns bowel disease uterine fibroids premature labor chronic inflammation such as IBD renal allograft rejection inflammatory bowel disease nephrotic syndrome undesired or aberrant tissue mass growth non cancer hemophilic joints hypertrophic scars inhibition of hair growth Osler Weber syndrome pyogenic granuloma retrolental fibroplasias scleroderma trachoma vascular adhesions synovitis dermatitis preeclampsia ascites pericardial effusion such as that associated with pericarditis and pleural effusion.

As used herein treatment refers to clinical intervention in an attempt to alter the natural course of the individual or cell being treated and can be performed either for prophylaxis or during the course of clinical pathology. Desirable effects of treatment include preventing occurrence or recurrence of disease alleviation of symptoms diminishment of any direct or indirect pathological consequences of the disease preventing metastasis decreasing the rate of disease progression amelioration or palliation of the disease state and remission or improved prognosis. In some embodiments antibodies of the invention are used to delay development of a disease or disorder.

An effective amount refers to an amount effective at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic result.

A therapeutically effective amount of a substance molecule of the invention agonist or antagonist may vary according to factors such as the disease state age sex and weight of the individual and the ability of the substance molecule agonist or antagonist to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the substance molecule agonist or antagonist are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. The term therapeutically effective amount refers to an amount of an antibody polypeptide or antagonist of this invention effective to treat a disease or disorder in a mammal aka patient . In the case of cancer the therapeutically effective amount of the drug can reduce the number of cancer cells reduce the tumor size or weight inhibit i.e. slow to some extent and preferably stop cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs inhibit i.e. slow to some extent and preferably stop tumor metastasis inhibit to some extent tumor growth and or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug can prevent growth and or kill existing cancer cells it can be cytostatic and or cytotoxic. In one embodiment the therapeutically effective amount is a growth inhibitory amount. In another embodiment the therapeutically effective amount is an amount that extends the survival of a patient. In another embodiment the therapeutically effective amount is an amount that improves progression free survival of a patient.

A prophylactically effective amount refers to an amount effective at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically but not necessarily since a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease the prophylactically effective amount is less than the therapeutically effective amount.

The term cytotoxic agent as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the function of cells and or causes destruction of cells. The term is intended to include radioactive isotopes e.g. At I I Y Re Re Sm Bi Pand radioactive isotopes of Lu chemotherapeutic agents e.g. methotrexate adriamicin vinca alkaloids vincristine vinblastine etoposide doxorubicin melphalan mitomycin C chlorambucil daunorubicin or other intercalating agents enzymes and fragments thereof such as nucleolytic enzymes antibiotics and toxins such as small molecule toxins or enzymatically active toxins of bacterial fungal plant or animal origin including fragments and or variants thereof and the various antitumor or anticancer agents disclosed below.

Additional chemotherapeutic agents include the cytotoxic agents useful as antibody drug conjugates such as maytansinoids DM1 for example and the auristatins MMAE and MMAF for example.

 Chemotherapeutic agents also include anti hormonal agents that act to regulate reduce block or inhibit the effects of hormones that can promote the growth of cancer and are often in the form of systemic or whole body treatment. They may be hormones themselves. Examples include anti estrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators SERMs including for example tamoxifen including NOLVADEX tamoxifen EVISTA raloxifene droloxifene 4 hydroxytamoxifen trioxifene keoxifene LY117018 onapristone and FARESTON toremifene anti progesterones estrogen receptor down regulators ERDs agents that function to suppress or shut down the ovaries for example leutinizing hormone releasing hormone LHRH agonists such as LUPRON and ELIGARD leuprolide acetate goserelin acetate buserelin acetate and tripterelin other anti androgens such as flutamide nilutamide and bicalutamide and aromatase inhibitors that inhibit the enzyme aromatase which regulates estrogen production in the adrenal glands such as for example 4 5 imidazoles aminoglutethimide MEGASE megestrol acetate AROMASIN exemestane formestanie fadrozole RIVISOR vorozole FEMARA letrozole and ARIMIDEX anastrozole. In addition such definition of chemotherapeutic agents includes bisphosphonates such as clodronate for example BONEFOS or OSTAC DIDROCAL etidronate NE 58095 ZOMETA zoledronic acid zoledronate FOSAMAX alendronate AREDIA pamidronate SKELID tiludronate or ACTONEL risedronate as well as troxacitabine a 1 3 dioxolane nucleoside cytosine analog antisense oligonucleotides particularly those that inhibit expression of genes in signaling pathways implicated in abherant cell proliferation such as for example PKC alpha Raf H Ras and epidermal growth factor receptor EGF R vaccines such as THERATOPE vaccine and gene therapy vaccines for example ALLOVECTIN vaccine LEUVECTIN vaccine and VAXID vaccine LURTOTECAN topoisomerase 1 inhibitor ABARELIX rmRH lapatinib ditosylate an ErbB 2 and EGFR dual tyrosine kinase small molecule inhibitor also known as GW572016 and pharmaceutically acceptable salts acids or derivatives of any of the above.

A growth inhibitory agent when used herein refers to a compound or composition which inhibits growth and or proliferation of a cell e.g. a cell expressing Robo4 either in vitro or in vivo. Thus the growth inhibitory agent may be one which significantly reduces the percentage of Robo4 expressing cells in S phase. Examples of growth inhibitory agents include agents that block cell cycle progression at a place other than S phase such as agents that induce G1 arrest and M phase arrest. Classical M phase blockers include the vincas vincristine and vinblastine taxanes and topoisomerase II inhibitors such as doxorubicin epirubicin daunorubicin etoposide and bleomycin. Those agents that arrest G1 also spill over into S phase arrest for example DNA alkylating agents such as tamoxifen prednisone dacarbazine mechlorethamine cisplatin methotrexate 5 fluorouracil and ara C. Further information can be found in Mendelsohn and Israel eds. Chapter 1 entitled Cell cycle regulation oncogenes and antineoplastic drugs by Murakami et al. WB Saunders Philadelphia 1995 especially p. 13. The taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel are anticancer drugs both derived from the yew tree. Docetaxel TAXOTERE Rhone Poulenc Rorer derived from the European yew is a semisynthetic analogue of paclitaxel TAXOL Bristol Myers Squibb . Paclitaxel and docetaxel promote the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilize microtubules by preventing depolymerization which results in the inhibition of mitosis in cells.

Exemplary monoclonal antibodies derived from a phage library are provided herein and described in the Examples below. Those antibodies are designated YW71.6 YW71.1 YW71.22 YW71.89 YW79.1 YW79.8 and YW79.11. Those antibodies were affinity matured to generate YW71.22.S1.2 YW71.22S1.8 YW71.22S1.16 YW71.22S1.23 YW71.22S1.24 YW71.22S1.27 YW71.22S1.31 YW71.22S1.38 YW71.22S1.77 YW71.22.S2.21 YW71.22.S2.79 YW71.22.H1.2 YW71.22.H1.9 YW71.22.H1.46 YW71.22.H1.77 YW71.22.H1.91 and YW71.22.H2.31. The sequences of the heavy and light chain variable domains of the antibodies are set forth in .

An antibody of the invention can comprise any suitable human or human consensus light chain framework sequences provided the antibody exhibits the desired biological characteristics e.g. a desired binding affinity .

In one embodiment human consensus frameworks herein are from or derived from VH subgroup III see and or VL kappa subgroup I see consensus framework sequences.

Thus the VH acceptor human framework may comprise one two three or all four of the following framework sequences 

human VH subgroup I consensus frameworks 1 4 minus extended hypervariable regions SEQ ID NOS 114 115 113 16 or SEQ ID NOS 114 115 116 16 or SEQ ID NOS 114 115 117 16

In one embodiment the VH acceptor human framework region 4 H FR4 comprises WGQGTLVTVSS SEQ ID NO 45 .

The VL acceptor human framework may comprise one two three or four of the following framework sequences 

While the acceptor may be identical in sequence to the human framework sequence selected whether that be from a human immunoglobulin or a human consensus framework the present invention contemplates that the acceptor sequence may comprise pre existing amino acid substitutions relative to the human immunoglobulin sequence or human consensus framework sequence. These pre existing substitutions are preferably minimal usually four three two or one amino acid differences only relative to the human immunoglobulin sequence or consensus framework sequence.

Hypervariable region residues of the non human antibody are incorporated into the VL and or VH acceptor human frameworks. For example one may incorporate residues corresponding to the Kabat CDR residues the Chothia hypervariable loop residues the Abm residues and or contact residues. Optionally the extended hypervariable region residues as follows are incorporated 24 34 L1 50 56 L2 and 89 97 L3 26 35 H1 50 65 or 49 65 H2 and 93 102 94 102 or 95 102 H3 .

While incorporation of hypervariable region residues is discussed herein it will be appreciated that this can be achieved in various ways for example nucleic acid encoding the desired amino acid sequence can be generated by mutating nucleic acid encoding the mouse variable domain sequence so that the framework residues thereof are changed to acceptor human framework residues or by mutating nucleic acid encoding the human variable domain sequence so that the hypervariable domain residues are changed to non human residues or by synthesizing nucleic acid encoding the desired sequence etc.

In the examples herein hypervariable region grafted variants were generated by Kunkel mutagenesis of nucleic acid encoding the human acceptor sequences using a separate oligonucleotide for each hypervariable region. Kunkel et al. 154 367 382 1987 . Appropriate changes can be introduced within the framework and or hypervariable region using routine techniques to correct and re establish proper hypervariable region antigen interactions.

The present invention encompasses antibody fragments. Antibody fragments may be generated by traditional means such as enzymatic digestion or by recombinant techniques. In certain circumstances there are advantages of using antibody fragments rather than whole antibodies. The smaller size of the fragments allows for rapid clearance and may lead to improved access to solid tumors. For a review of certain antibody fragments see Hudson et al. 2003 9 129 134.

Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies see e.g. Morimoto et al. 24 107 117 1992 and Brennan et al. 229 81 1985 . However these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. Fab Fv and ScFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from thus allowing the facile production of large amounts of these fragments. Antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively Fab SH fragments can be directly recovered from and chemically coupled to form F ab fragments Carter et al. 10 163 167 1992 . According to another approach F ab fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Fab and F ab fragment with increased in vivo half life comprising salvage receptor binding epitope residues are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 869 046. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In certain embodiments an antibody is a single chain Fv fragment scFv . See WO 93 16185 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 571 894 and 5 587 458. Fv and scFv are the only species with intact combining sites that are devoid of constant regions thus they may be suitable for reduced nonspecific binding during in vivo use. scFv fusion proteins may be constructed to yield fusion of an effector protein at either the amino or the carboxy terminus of an scFv. See ed. Borrebaeck supra. The antibody fragment may also be a linear antibody e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 870 for example. Such linear antibodies may be monospecific or bispecific.

The invention encompasses humanized antibodies. Various methods for humanizing non human antibodies are known in the art. For example a humanized antibody can have one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non human. These non human amino acid residues are often referred to as import residues which are typically taken from an import variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co workers Jones et al. 1986 321 522 525 Riechmann et al. 1988 332 323 327 Verhoeyen et al. 1988 239 1534 1536 by substituting hypervariable region sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly such humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non human species. In practice humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some hypervariable region residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.

The choice of human variable domains both light and heavy to be used in making the humanized antibodies can be important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so called best fit method the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework for the humanized antibody. See e.g. Sims et al. 1993 151 2296 Chothia et al. 1987 196 901. Another method uses a particular framework derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies. See e.g. Carter et al 1992 89 4285 Presta et al. 1993 151 2623.

It is further generally desirable that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal according to one method humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence i.e. the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic such as increased affinity for the target antigen s is achieved. In general the hypervariable region residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.

In some embodiments the invention provides antibodies that are humanized such that HAMA response is reduced or eliminated. Reduction or elimination of a HAMA response is a significant aspect of clinical development of suitable therapeutic agents. See e.g. Khaxzaeli et al. . 1988 80 937 Jaffers et al. 1986 41 572 Shawler et al. . 1985 135 1530 Sears et al. . 1984 3 138 Miller et al. 1983 62 988 Hakimi et al. . 1991 147 1352 Reichmann et al. 1988 332 323 Junghans et al. . 1990 50 1495. Variants of these antibodies can further be obtained using routine methods known in the art some of which are further described below.

For example an amino acid sequence from an antibody as described herein can serve as a starting parent sequence for diversification of the framework and or hypervariable sequence s . A selected framework sequence to which a starting hypervariable sequence is linked is referred to herein as an acceptor human framework. While the acceptor human frameworks may be from or derived from a human immunoglobulin the VL and or VH regions thereof preferably the acceptor human frameworks are from or derived from a human consensus framework sequence as such frameworks have been demonstrated to have minimal or no immunogenicity in human patients.

Where the acceptor is derived from a human immunoglobulin one may optionally select a human framework sequence that is selected based on its homology to the donor framework sequence by aligning the donor framework sequence with various human framework sequences in a collection of human framework sequences and select the most homologous framework sequence as the acceptor.

Human antibodies of the invention can be constructed by combining Fv clone variable domain sequence s selected from human derived phage display libraries with known human constant domain sequences s as described above. Alternatively human monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be made by the hybridoma method. Human myeloma and mouse human heteromyeloma cell lines for the production of human monoclonal antibodies have been described for example by Kozbor 133 3001 1984 Brodeur et al. pp. 51 63 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1987 and Boerner et al. 147 86 1991 .

It is now possible to produce transgenic animals e.g. mice that are capable upon immunization of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy chain joining region JH gene in chimeric and germ line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See e.g. Jakobovits et al. 90 2551 1993 Jakobovits et al. 362 255 1993 Bruggermann et al. 7 33 1993 .

Gene shuffling can also be used to derive human antibodies from non human e.g. rodent antibodies where the human antibody has similar affinities and specificities to the starting non human antibody. According to this method which is also called epitope imprinting either the heavy or light chain variable region of a non human antibody fragment obtained by phage display techniques as described herein is replaced with a repertoire of human V domain genes creating a population of non human chain human chain scFv or Fab chimeras. Selection with antigen results in isolation of a non human chain human chain chimeric scFv or Fab wherein the human chain restores the antigen binding site destroyed upon removal of the corresponding non human chain in the primary phage display clone i.e. the epitope governs imprints the choice of the human chain partner. When the process is repeated in order to replace the remaining non human chain a human antibody is obtained see PCT WO 93 06213 published Apr. 1 1993 . Unlike traditional humanization of non human antibodies by CDR grafting this technique provides completely human antibodies which have no FR or CDR residues of non human origin.

In some embodiments amino acid sequence modification s of the antibodies described herein are contemplated. For example it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of the antibody may be prepared by introducing appropriate changes into the nucleotide sequence encoding the antibody or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include for example deletions from and or insertions into and or substitutions of residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of deletion insertion and substitution can be made to arrive at the final construct provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid alterations may be introduced in the subject antibody amino acid sequence at the time that sequence is made.

A useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called alanine scanning mutagenesis as described by Cunningham and Wells 1989 244 1081 1085. Here a residue or group of target residues are identified e.g. charged residues such as arg asp his lys and glu and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid e.g. alanine or polyalanine to affect the interaction of the amino acids with antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at or for the sites of substitution. Thus while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed immunoglobulins are screened for the desired activity.

Amino acid sequence insertions include amino and or carboxyl terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N terminal methionyl residue. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N or C terminus of the antibody to an enzyme e.g. for ADEPT or a polypeptide which increases the serum half life of the antibody.

In certain embodiments an antibody of the invention is altered to increase or decrease the extent to which the antibody is glycosylated. Glycosylation of polypeptides is typically either N linked or O linked. N linked refers to the attachment of a carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine X serine and asparagine X threonine where X is any amino acid except proline are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N aceylgalactosamine galactose or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid most commonly serine or threonine although 5 hydroxyproline or 5 hydroxylysine may also be used.

Addition or deletion of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that one or more of the above described tripeptide sequences for N linked glycosylation sites is created or removed. The alteration may also be made by the addition deletion or substitution of one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody for O linked glycosylation sites .

Where the antibody comprises an Fc region the carbohydrate attached thereto may be altered. Native antibodies produced by mammalian cells typically comprise a branched biantennary oligosaccharide that is generally attached by an N linkage to Asn297 of the CH2 domain of the Fc region. See e.g. Wright et al. 1997 15 26 32. The oligosaccharide may include various carbohydrates e.g. mannose N acetyl glucosamine GlcNAc galactose and sialic acid as well as a fucose attached to a GlcNAc in the stem of the biantennary oligosaccharide structure. In some embodiments modifications of the oligosaccharide in an antibody of the invention may be made in order to create antibody variants with certain improved properties.

For example antibody variants are provided having a carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose attached directly or indirectly to an Fc region. Such variants may have improved ADCC function. See e.g. US Patent Publication Nos. US 2003 0157108 Presta L. US 2004 0093621 Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co. Ltd . Examples of publications related to defucosylated or fucose deficient antibody variants include US 2003 0157108 WO 2000 61739 WO 2001 29246 US 2003 0115614 US 2002 0164328 US 2004 0093621 US 2004 0132140 US 2004 0110704 US 2004 0110282 US 2004 0109865 WO 2003 085119 WO 2003 084570 WO 2005 035586 WO 2005 035778 WO2005 053742 WO2002 031140 Okazaki et al. 336 1239 1249 2004 Yamane Ohnuki et al. 87 614 2004 . Examples of cell lines capable of producing defucosylated antibodies include Lec 13 CHO cells deficient in protein fucosylation Ripka et al. 249 533 545 1986 US Pat Appl No US 2003 0157108 A1 Presta L and WO 2004 056312 A1 Adams et al. especially at Example 11 and knockout cell lines such as alpha 1 6 fucosyltransferase gene FUT8 knockout CHO cells see e.g. Yamane Ohnuki et al. 87 614 2004 Kanda Y. et al. 94 4 680 688 2006 and WO2003 085107 .

Antibodies variants are further provided with bisected oligosaccharides e.g. in which a biantennary oligosaccharide attached to the Fc region of the antibody is bisected by GlcNAc. Such antibody variants may have reduced fucosylation and or improved ADCC function. Examples of such antibody variants are described e.g. in WO 2003 011878 Jean Mairet et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 602 684 Umana et al. and US 2005 0123546 Umana et al. . Antibody variants with at least one galactose residue in the oligosaccharide attached to the Fc region are also provided. Such antibody variants may have improved CDC function. Such antibody variants are described e.g. in WO 1997 30087 Patel et al. WO 1998 58964 Raju S. and WO 1999 22764 Raju S. .

In certain embodiments an antibody variant comprises an Fc region with one or more amino acid substitutions which further improve ADCC for example substitutions at positions 298 333 and or 334 of the Fc region Eu numbering of residues . Such substitutions may occur in combination with any of the variations described above.

In certain embodiments the invention contemplates an antibody variant that possesses some but not all effector functions which make it a desirable candidate for many applications in which the half life of the antibody in vivo is important yet certain effector functions such as complement and ADCC are unnecessary or deleterious. In certain embodiments the Fc activities of the antibody are measured to ensure that only the desired properties are maintained. In vitro and or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the reduction depletion of CDC and or ADCC activities. For example Fc receptor FcR binding assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks Fc R binding hence likely lacking ADCC activity but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC NK cells express Fc RIII only whereas monocytes express Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 92 1991 . Non limiting examples of in vitro assays to assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 500 362 see e.g. Hellstrom I. et al. 83 7059 7063 1986 and Hellstrom I et al. 82 1499 1502 1985 U.S. Pat. No. 5 821 337 see Bruggemann M. et al. 166 1351 1361 1987 . Alternatively non radioactive assays methods may be employed see for example ACTI non radioactive cytotoxicity assay for flow cytometry CellTechnology Inc. Mountain View Calif. and CytoTox 96 non radioactive cytotoxicity assay Promega Madison Wis. . Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC and Natural Killer NK cells. Alternatively or additionally ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo e.g. in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. 95 652 656 1998 . C1q binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind C1q and hence lacks CDC activity. To assess complement activation a CDC assay may be performed see for example Gazzano Santoro et al. 202 163 1996 Cragg M. S. et al. 101 1045 1052 2003 and Cragg M. S. and M. J. Glennie 103 2738 2743 2004 . FcRn binding and in vivo clearance half life determinations can also be performed using methods known in the art see for example Petkova S. B. et al. 18 12 1759 1769 2006 .

Other antibody variants having one or more amino acid substitutions are provided. Sites of interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions but FR alterations are also contemplated. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 1 under the heading of preferred substitutions. More substantial changes denominated exemplary substitutions are provided in Table 1 or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes. Amino acid substitutions may be introduced into an antibody of interest and the products screened e.g. for a desired activity such as improved antigen binding decreased immunogenicity improved ADCC or CDC etc.

Modifications in the biological properties of an antibody may be accomplished by selecting substitutions that affect a the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution for example as a sheet or helical conformation b the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site or c the bulk of the side chain. Amino acids may be grouped according to similarities in the properties of their side chains in A. L. Lehninger in Biochemistry second ed. pp. 73 75 Worth Publishers New York 1975 

Alternatively naturally occurring residues may be divided into groups based on common side chain properties 

Non conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class. Such substituted residues also may be introduced into the conservative substitution sites or into the remaining non conserved sites.

One type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody e.g. a humanized or human antibody . Generally the resulting variant s selected for further development will have modified e.g. improved biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. An exemplary substitutional variant is an affinity matured antibody which may be conveniently generated using phage display based affinity maturation techniques. Briefly several hypervariable region sites e.g. 6 7 sites are mutated to generate all possible amino acid substitutions at each site. The antibodies thus generated are displayed from filamentous phage particles as fusions to at least part of a phage coat protein e.g. the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity e.g. binding affinity . In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification scanning mutagenesis e.g. alanine scanning can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively or additionally it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and antigen. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to techniques known in the art including those elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated the panel of variants is subjected to screening using techniques known in the art including those described herein and variants with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.

Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include but are not limited to isolation from a natural source in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants or preparation by oligonucleotide mediated or site directed mutagenesis PCR mutagenesis and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non variant version of the antibody.

It may be desirable to introduce one or more amino acid modifications in an Fc region of antibodies of the invention thereby generating an Fc region variant. The Fc region variant may comprise a human Fc region sequence e.g. a human IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 or IgG4 Fc region comprising an amino acid modification e.g. a substitution at one or more amino acid positions including that of a hinge cysteine.

In accordance with this description and the teachings of the art it is contemplated that in some embodiments an antibody of the invention may comprise one or more alterations as compared to the wild type counterpart antibody e.g. in the Fc region. These antibodies would nonetheless retain substantially the same characteristics required for therapeutic utility as compared to their wild type counterpart. For example it is thought that certain alterations can be made in the Fc region that would result in altered i.e. either improved or diminished C1q binding and or Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity CDC e.g. as described in WO99 51642. See also Duncan Winter 322 738 40 1988 U.S. Pat. No. 5 648 260 U.S. Pat. No. 5 624 821 and WO94 29351 concerning other examples of Fc region variants. WO00 42072 Presta and WO 2004 056312 Lowman describe antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs. The content of these patent publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference. See also Shields et al. 9 2 6591 6604 2001 . Antibodies with increased half lives and improved binding to the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus Guyer et al. 117 587 1976 and Kim et al. 24 249 1994 are described in US2005 0014934A1 Hinton et al. . These antibodies comprise an Fc region with one or more substitutions therein which improve binding of the Fc region to FcRn. Polypeptide variants with altered Fc region amino acid sequences and increased or decreased C1q binding capability are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 194 551B1 WO99 51642. The contents of those patent publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference. See also Idusogie et al. 164 4178 4184 2000 .

In another aspect the invention provides antibodies comprising modifications in the interface of Fc polypeptides comprising the Fc region wherein the modifications facilitate and or promote heterodimerization. These modifications comprise introduction of a protuberance into a first Fc polypeptide and a cavity into a second Fc polypeptide wherein the protuberance is positionable in the cavity so as to promote complexing of the first and second Fc polypeptides. Methods of generating antibodies with these modifications are known in the art e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 731 168.

In yet another aspect it may be desirable to create cysteine engineered antibodies e.g. thioMAbs and thioFabs in which one or more residues of an antibody are substituted with cysteine residues. In particular embodiments the substituted residues occur at accessible sites of the antibody. By substituting those residues with cysteine reactive thiol groups are thereby positioned at accessible sites of the antibody and may be used to conjugate the antibody to other moieties such as drug moieties or linker drug moieties as described further herein. In certain embodiments any one or more of the following residues may be substituted with cysteine V205 Kabat numbering of the light chain A118 EU numbering of the heavy chain and S400 EU numbering of the heavy chain Fc region. In a preferred embodiment A118 EU numbering of the heavy chain is substituted for cysteine. Cysteine engineered thioMabs and thioFabs are described in further detail herein below.

The antibodies of the present invention can be further modified to contain additional nonproteinaceous moieties that are known in the art and readily available. Preferably the moieties suitable for derivatization of the antibody are water soluble polymers. Non limiting examples of water soluble polymers include but are not limited to polyethylene glycol PEG copolymers of ethylene glycol propylene glycol carboxymethylcellulose dextran polyvinyl alcohol polyvinyl pyrrolidone poly 1 3 dioxolane poly 1 3 6 trioxane ethylene maleic anhydride copolymer polyaminoacids either homopolymers or random copolymers and dextran or poly n vinyl pyrrolidone polyethylene glycol propropylene glycol homopolymers polypropylene oxide ethylene oxide co polymers polyoxyethylated polyols e.g. glycerol polyvinyl alcohol and mixtures thereof. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde may have advantages in manufacturing due to its stability in water. The polymer may be of any molecular weight and may be branched or unbranched. The number of polymers attached to the antibody may vary and if more than one polymer are attached they can be the same or different molecules. In general the number and or type of polymers used for derivatization can be determined based on considerations including but not limited to the particular properties or functions of the antibody to be improved whether the antibody derivative will be used in a therapy under defined conditions etc.

In another embodiment conjugates of an antibody and nonproteinaceous moiety that may be selectively heated by exposure to radiation are provided. In one embodiment the nonproteinaceous moiety is a carbon nanotube Kam et al. 102 11600 11605 2005 . The radiation may be of any wavelength and includes but is not limited to wavelengths that do not harm ordinary cells but which heat the nonproteinaceous moiety to a temperature at which cells proximal to the antibody nonproteinaceous moiety are killed.

Antibodies of the invention may be prepared by phage mid display techniques as disclosed in Lee et al. J. Mol. Biol. 2004 340 5 1073 93 . Phage mid display allows the generation of large libraries of protein variants which can be rapidly sorted for those sequences that bind to a target molecule with high affinity. Nucleic acids encoding variant polypeptides are generally fused to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a viral coat protein such as the gene III protein or the gene VIII protein. Monovalent phagemid display systems where the nucleic acid sequence encoding the protein or polypeptide is fused to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a portion of the gene III protein have been developed. Bass S. 8 309 1990 Lowman and Wells 3 205 1991 . In a monovalent phagemid display system the gene fusion is expressed at low levels and wild type gene III proteins are also expressed so that infectivity of the particles is retained. Methods of generating peptide libraries and screening those libraries have been disclosed in many patents e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 723 286 U.S. Pat. No. 5 432 018 U.S. Pat. No. 5 580 717 U.S. Pat. No. 5 427 908 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 498 530 .

Libraries of antibodies or antigen binding polypeptides have been prepared in a number of ways including by altering a single gene by inserting random DNA sequences or by cloning a family of related genes. Methods for displaying antibodies or antigen binding fragments using phage mid display have been described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 750 373 5 733 743 5 837 242 5 969 108 6 172 197 5 580 717 and 5 658 727. The library is then screened for expression of antibodies or antigen binding proteins with the desired characteristics.

Methods of substituting an amino acid of choice into a template nucleic acid are well established in the art some of which are described herein. For example hypervariable region residues can be substituted using the Kunkel method. See e.g. Kunkel et al. 154 367 382 1987 .

The sequence of oligonucleotides includes one or more of the designed codon sets for the hypervariable region residues to be altered. A codon set is a set of different nucleotide triplet sequences used to encode desired variant amino acids. Codon sets can be represented using symbols to designate particular nucleotides or equimolar mixtures of nucleotides as shown in below according to the IUB code.

For example in the codon set DVK D can be nucleotides A or G or T V can be A or G or C and K can be G or T. This codon set can present 18 different codons and can encode amino acids Ala Trp Tyr Lys Thr Asn Lys Ser Arg Asp Glu Gly and Cys.

Oligonucleotide or primer sets can be synthesized using standard methods. A set of oligonucleotides can be synthesized for example by solid phase synthesis containing sequences that represent all possible combinations of nucleotide triplets provided by the codon set and that will encode the desired group of amino acids. Synthesis of oligonucleotides with selected nucleotide degeneracy at certain positions is well known in that art. Such sets of nucleotides having certain codon sets can be synthesized using commercial nucleic acid synthesizers available from for example Applied Biosystems Foster City Calif. or can be obtained commercially for example from Life Technologies Rockville Md. . Therefore a set of oligonucleotides synthesized having a particular codon set will typically include a plurality of oligonucleotides with different sequences the differences established by the codon set within the overall sequence. Oligonucleotides as used according to the invention have sequences that allow for hybridization to a variable domain nucleic acid template and also can include restriction enzyme sites for cloning purposes.

In one method nucleic acid sequences encoding variant amino acids can be created by oligonucleotide mediated mutagenesis. This technique is well known in the art as described by Zoller et al. 10 6487 6504 1987 . Briefly nucleic acid sequences encoding variant amino acids are created by hybridizing an oligonucleotide set encoding the desired codon sets to a DNA template where the template is the single stranded form of the plasmid containing a variable region nucleic acid template sequence. After hybridization DNA polymerase is used to synthesize an entire second complementary strand of the template that will thus incorporate the oligonucleotide primer and will contain the codon sets as provided by the oligonucleotide set.

Generally oligonucleotides of at least 25 nucleotides in length are used. An optimal oligonucleotide will have 12 to 15 nucleotides that are completely complementary to the template on either side of the nucleotide s coding for the mutation s . This ensures that the oligonucleotide will hybridize properly to the single stranded DNA template molecule. The oligonucleotides are readily synthesized using techniques known in the art such as that described by Crea et al. 75 5765 1978 .

The DNA template is generated by those vectors that are either derived from bacteriophage M13 vectors the commercially available M13 mp18 and M13 mp19 vectors are suitable or those vectors that contain a single stranded phage origin of replication as described by Viera et al. 153 3 1987 . Thus the DNA that is to be mutated can be inserted into one of these vectors in order to generate single stranded template. Production of the single stranded template is described in sections 4.21 4.41 of Sambrook et al. above.

To alter the native DNA sequence the oligonucleotide is hybridized to the single stranded template under suitable hybridization conditions. A DNA polymerizing enzyme usually T7 DNA polymerase or the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I is then added to synthesize the complementary strand of the template using the oligonucleotide as a primer for synthesis. A heteroduplex molecule is thus formed such that one strand of DNA encodes the mutated form of gene 1 and the other strand the original template encodes the native unaltered sequence of gene 1. This heteroduplex molecule is then transformed into a suitable host cell usually a prokaryote such as JM101. After growing the cells they are plated onto agarose plates and screened using the oligonucleotide primer radiolabeled with a 32 Phosphate to identify the bacterial colonies that contain the mutated DNA.

The method described immediately above may be modified such that a homoduplex molecule is created wherein both strands of the plasmid contain the mutation s . The modifications are as follows The single stranded oligonucleotide is annealed to the single stranded template as described above. A mixture of three deoxyribonucleotides deoxyriboadenosine dATP deoxyriboguanosine dGTP and deoxyribothymidine dTT is combined with a modified thiodeoxyribocytosine called dCTP aS which can be obtained from Amersham . This mixture is added to the template oligonucleotide complex. Upon addition of DNA polymerase to this mixture a strand of DNA identical to the template except for the mutated bases is generated. In addition this new strand of DNA will contain dCTP aS instead of dCTP which serves to protect it from restriction endonuclease digestion. After the template strand of the double stranded heteroduplex is nicked with an appropriate restriction enzyme the template strand can be digested with ExoIII nuclease or another appropriate nuclease past the region that contains the site s to be mutagenized. The reaction is then stopped to leave a molecule that is only partially single stranded. A complete double stranded DNA homoduplex is then formed using DNA polymerase in the presence of all four deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates ATP and DNA ligase. This homoduplex molecule can then be transformed into a suitable host cell.

As indicated previously the sequence of the oligonucleotide set is of sufficient length to hybridize to the template nucleic acid and may also but does not necessarily contain restriction sites. The DNA template can be generated by those vectors that are either derived from bacteriophage M13 vectors or vectors that contain a single stranded phage origin of replication as described by Viera et al. 153 3 1987 . Thus the DNA that is to be mutated must be inserted into one of these vectors in order to generate single stranded template. Production of the single stranded template is described in sections 4.21 4.41 of Sambrook et al. supra.

According to another method a library can be generated by providing upstream and downstream oligonucleotide sets each set having a plurality of oligonucleotides with different sequences the different sequences established by the codon sets provided within the sequence of the oligonucleotides. The upstream and downstream oligonucleotide sets along with a variable domain template nucleic acid sequence can be used in a polymerase chain reaction to generate a library of PCR products. The PCR products can be referred to as nucleic acid cassettes as they can be fused with other related or unrelated nucleic acid sequences for example viral coat proteins and dimerization domains using established molecular biology techniques.

The sequence of the PCR primers includes one or more of the designed codon sets for the solvent accessible and highly diverse positions in a hypervariable region. As described above a codon set is a set of different nucleotide triplet sequences used to encode desired variant amino acids.

Antibody selectants that meet the desired criteria as selected through appropriate screening selection steps can be isolated and cloned using standard recombinant techniques.

Many vectors are available. The vector components generally include but are not limited to one or more of the following a signal sequence an origin of replication one or more marker genes an enhancer element a promoter and a transcription termination sequence.

An antibody of the invention may be produced recombinantly not only directly but also as a fusion polypeptide with a heterologous polypeptide which is preferably a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide. The heterologous signal sequence selected preferably is one that is recognized and processed i.e. cleaved by a signal peptidase by the host cell. For prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process a native antibody signal sequence the signal sequence is substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence selected for example from the group of the alkaline phosphatase penicillinase lpp or heat stable enterotoxin II leaders. For yeast secretion the native signal sequence may be substituted by e.g. the yeast invertase leader factor leader including and factor leaders or acid phosphatase leader the glucoamylase leader or the signal described in WO 90 13646. In mammalian cell expression mammalian signal sequences as well as viral secretory leaders for example the herpes simplex gD signal are available.

Both expression and cloning vectors contain a nucleic acid sequence that enables the vector to replicate in one or more selected host cells. Generally in cloning vectors this sequence is one that enables the vector to replicate independently of the host chromosomal DNA and includes origins of replication or autonomously replicating sequences. Such sequences are well known for a variety of bacteria yeast and viruses. The origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 is suitable for most Gram negative bacteria the 2 plasmid origin is suitable for yeast and various viral origins SV40 polyoma adenovirus VSV or BPV are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian cells. Generally the origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors the SV40 origin may typically be used only because it contains the early promoter .

Expression and cloning vectors may contain a selection gene also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that a confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins e.g. ampicillin neomycin methotrexate or tetracycline b complement auxotrophic deficiencies or c supply critical nutrients not available from complex media e.g. the gene encoding D alanine racemase for Bacilli.

One example of a selection scheme utilizes a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those cells that are successfully transformed with a heterologous gene produce a protein conferring drug resistance and thus survive the selection regimen. Examples of such dominant selection use the drugs neomycin mycophenolic acid and hygromycin.

Another example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification of cells competent to take up antibody encoding nucleic acid such as DHFR glutamine synthetase GS thymidine kinase metallothionein I and II preferably primate metallothionein genes adenosine deaminase ornithine decarboxylase etc.

For example cells transformed with the DHFR gene are identified by culturing the transformants in a culture medium containing methotrexate Mtx a competitive antagonist of DHFR. Under these conditions the DHFR gene is amplified along with any other co transformed nucleic acid. A Chinese hamster ovary CHO cell line deficient in endogenous DHFR activity e.g. ATCC CRL 9096 may be used.

Alternatively cells transformed with the GS gene are identified by culturing the transformants in a culture medium containing L methionine sulfoximine Msx an inhibitor of GS. Under these conditions the GS gene is amplified along with any other co transformed nucleic acid. The GS selection amplification system may be used in combination with the DHFR selection amplification system described above.

Alternatively host cells particularly wild type hosts that contain endogenous DHFR transformed or co transformed with DNA sequences encoding an antibody of interest wild type DHFR gene and another selectable marker such as aminoglycoside 3 phosphotransferase APH can be selected by cell proliferation in medium containing a selection agent for the selectable marker such as an aminoglycosidic antibiotic e.g. kanamycin neomycin or G418. See U.S. Pat. No. 4 965 199.

A suitable selection gene for use in yeast is the trp1 gene present in the yeast plasmid YRp7 Stinchcomb et al. 282 39 1979 . The trp1 gene provides a selection marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan for example ATCC No. 44076 or PEP4 1. Jones 85 12 1977 . The presence of the trp1 lesion in the yeast host cell genome then provides an effective environment for detecting transformation by growth in the absence of tryptophan. Similarly Leu2 deficient yeast strains ATCC 20 622 or 38 626 are complemented by known plasmids bearing the Leu2 gene.

In addition vectors derived from the 1.6 m circular plasmid pKD1 can be used for transformation of yeasts. Alternatively an expression system for large scale production of recombinant calf chymosin was reported for . Van den Berg 8 135 1990 . Stable multi copy expression vectors for secretion of mature recombinant human serum albumin by industrial strains of have also been disclosed. Fleer et al. 9 968 975 1991 .

Expression and cloning vectors generally contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and is operably linked to nucleic acid encoding an antibody. Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the phoA promoter lactamase and lactose promoter systems alkaline phosphatase promoter a tryptophan trp promoter system and hybrid promoters such as the tac promoter. However other known bacterial promoters are suitable. Promoters for use in bacterial systems also will contain a Shine Dalgarno S.D. sequence operably linked to the DNA encoding an antibody.

Promoter sequences are known for eukaryotes. Virtually all eukaryotic genes have an AT rich region located approximately 25 to 30 bases upstream from the site where transcription is initiated. Another sequence found 70 to 80 bases upstream from the start of transcription of many genes is a CNCAAT region where N may be any nucleotide. At the 3 end of most eukaryotic genes is an AATAAA sequence that may be the signal for addition of the poly A tail to the 3 end of the coding sequence. All of these sequences are suitably inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors.

Examples of suitable promoter sequences for use with yeast hosts include the promoters for 3 phosphoglycerate kinase or other glycolytic enzymes such as enolase glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase hexokinase pyruvate decarboxylase phospho fructokinase glucose 6 phosphate isomerase 3 phosphoglycerate mutase pyruvate kinase triosephosphate isomerase phosphoglucose isomerase and glucokinase.

Other yeast promoters which are inducible promoters having the additional advantage of transcription controlled by growth conditions are the promoter regions for alcohol dehydrogenase 2 isocytochrome C acid phosphatase degradative enzymes associated with nitrogen metabolism metallothionein glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase and enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization. Suitable vectors and promoters for use in yeast expression are further described in EP 73 657. Yeast enhancers also are advantageously used with yeast promoters.

Antibody transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells can be controlled for example by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus fowlpox virus adenovirus such as Adenovirus 2 bovine papilloma virus avian sarcoma virus cytomegalovirus a retrovirus hepatitis B virus Simian Virus 40 SV40 or from heterologous mammalian promoters e.g. the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter from heat shock promoters provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.

The early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40 restriction fragment that also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication. The immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a HindIII E restriction fragment. A system for expressing DNA in mammalian hosts using the bovine papilloma virus as a vector is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 419 446. A modification of this system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 601 978. See also Reyes et al. 297 598 601 1982 on expression of human interferon cDNA in mouse cells under the control of a thymidine kinase promoter from herpes simplex virus. Alternatively the Rous Sarcoma Virus long terminal repeat can be used as the promoter.

Transcription of a DNA encoding an antibody of this invention by higher eukaryotes is often increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes globin elastase albumin fetoprotein and insulin . Typically however one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin bp 100 270 the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin and adenovirus enhancers. See also Yaniv 297 17 18 1982 on enhancing elements for activation of eukaryotic promoters. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5 or 3 to the antibody encoding sequence but is preferably located at a site 5 from the promoter.

Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells yeast fungi insect plant animal human or nucleated cells from other multicellular organisms will also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5 and occasionally 3 untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding antibody. One useful transcription termination component is the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation region. See WO94 11026 and the expression vector disclosed therein.

Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein are the prokaryote yeast or higher eukaryote cells described above. Suitable prokaryotes for this purpose include eubacteria such as Gram negative or Gram positive organisms for example Enterobacteriaceae such as e.g. e.g. e.g. and as well as Bacilli such as and e.g. 41P disclosed in DD 266 710 published 12 Apr. 1989 such as and . One preferred cloning host is 294 ATCC 31 446 although other strains such as B X1776 ATCC 31 537 and W3110 ATCC 27 325 are suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting.

Full length antibody antibody fusion proteins and antibody fragments can be produced in bacteria in particular when glycosylation and Fc effector function are not needed such as when the therapeutic antibody is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent e.g. a toxin that by itself shows effectiveness in tumor cell destruction. Full length antibodies have greater half life in circulation. Production in is faster and more cost efficient. For expression of antibody fragments and polypeptides in bacteria see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 648 237 Carter et. al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 789 199 Joly et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 840 523 Simmons et al. which describes translation initiation region TIR and signal sequences for optimizing expression and secretion. See also Charlton Vol. 248 B.K.C. Lo ed. Humana Press Totowa N.J. 2003 pp. 245 254 describing expression of antibody fragments in . After expression the antibody may be isolated from the cell paste in a soluble fraction and can be purified through e.g. a protein A or G column depending on the isotype. Final purification can be carried out similar to the process for purifying antibody expressed e.g. in CHO cells.

In addition to prokaryotes eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous fungi or yeast are suitable cloning or expression hosts for antibody encoding vectors. or common baker s yeast is the most commonly used among lower eukaryotic host microorganisms. However a number of other genera species and strains are commonly available and useful herein such as hosts such as e.g. ATCC 12 424 ATCC 16 045 ATCC 24 178 ATCC 56 500 ATCC 36 906 and EP 402 226 EP 183 070 EP 244 234 such as and filamentous fungi such as e.g. and hosts such as and . For a review discussing the use of yeasts and filamentous fungi for the production of therapeutic proteins see e.g. Gerngross 22 1409 1414 2004 .

Certain fungi and yeast strains may be selected in which glycosylation pathways have been humanized resulting in the production of an antibody with a partially or fully human glycosylation pattern. See e.g. Li et al. 24 210 215 2006 describing humanization of the glycosylation pathway in and Gerngross et al. supra.

Suitable host cells for the expression of glycosylated antibody are also derived from multicellular organisms invertebrates and vertebrates . Examples of invertebrate cells include plant and insect cells. Numerous baculoviral strains and variants and corresponding permissive insect host cells from hosts such as caterpillar mosquito mosquito fruitfly and have been identified. A variety of viral strains for transfection are publicly available e.g. the L 1 variant of NPV and the Bm 5 strain of NPV and such viruses may be used as the virus herein according to the present invention particularly for transfection of cells.

Plant cell cultures of cotton corn potato soybean petunia tomato duckweed Lemnaceae alfalfa and tobacco can also be utilized as hosts. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 959 177 6 040 498 6 420 548 7 125 978 and 6 417 429 describing PLANTIBODIES technology for producing antibodies in transgenic plants .

Vertebrate cells may be used as hosts and propagation of vertebrate cells in culture tissue culture has become a routine procedure. Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 COS 7 ATCC CRL 1651 human embryonic kidney line 293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture Graham et al. 36 59 1977 baby hamster kidney cells BHK ATCC CCL 10 mouse sertoli cells TM4 Mather 23 243 251 1980 monkey kidney cells CV1 ATCC CCL 70 African green monkey kidney cells VERO 76 ATCC CRL 1587 human cervical carcinoma cells HELA ATCC CCL 2 canine kidney cells MDCK ATCC CCL 34 buffalo rat liver cells BRL 3A ATCC CRL 1442 human lung cells W138 ATCC CCL 75 human liver cells Hep G2 HB 8065 mouse mammary tumor MMT 060562 ATCC CCL51 TR1 cells Mather et al. 383 44 68 1982 MRC 5 cells FS4 cells and a human hepatoma line Hep G2 . Other useful mammalian host cell lines include Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells including DHFR CHO cells Urlaub et al. 77 4216 1980 and myeloma cell lines such as NSO and Sp2 0. For a review of certain mammalian host cell lines suitable for antibody production see e.g. Yazaki and Wu 248 B. K. C. Lo ed. Humana Press Totowa N.J. 2003 pp. 255 268.

Host cells are transformed with the above described expression or cloning vectors for antibody production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters selecting transformants or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.

The host cells used to produce an antibody of this invention may be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham s F10 Sigma Minimal Essential Medium MEM Sigma RPMI 1640 Sigma and Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Medium DMEM Sigma are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition any of the media described in Ham et al. 58 44 1979 Barnes et al. 102 255 1980 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 767 704 4 657 866 4 927 762 4 560 655 or 5 122 469 WO 90 03430 WO 87 00195 or U.S. Pat. Re. 30 985 may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and or other growth factors such as insulin transferrin or epidermal growth factor salts such as sodium chloride calcium magnesium and phosphate buffers such as HEPES nucleotides such as adenosine and thymidine antibiotics such as GENTAMYCIN drug trace elements defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions such as temperature pH and the like are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.

When using recombinant techniques the antibody can be produced intracellularly in the periplasmic space or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly as a first step the particulate debris either host cells or lysed fragments are removed for example by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Carter et al. 10 163 167 1992 describe a procedure for isolating antibodies which are secreted to the periplasmic space of . Briefly cell paste is thawed in the presence of sodium acetate pH 3.5 EDTA and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride PMSF over about 30 min. Cell debris can be removed by centrifugation. Where the antibody is secreted into the medium supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter for example an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.

The antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using for example hydroxylapatite chromatography hydrophobic interaction chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis and affinity chromatography with affinity chromatography being among one of the typically preferred purification steps. The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human 1 2 or 4 heavy chains Lindmark et al. 62 1 13 1983 . Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human 3 Guss et al. 5 15671575 1986 . The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly styrenedivinyl benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a C3 domain the Bakerbond ABX resin J. T. Baker Phillipsburg N.J. is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion exchange column ethanol precipitation Reverse Phase HPLC chromatography on silica chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin such as a polyaspartic acid column chromatofocusing SDS PAGE and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.

Following any preliminary purification step s the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5 4.5 preferably performed at low salt concentrations e.g. from about 0 0.25M salt .

In general various methodologies for preparing antibodies for use in research testing and clinical are well established in the art consistent with the above described methodologies and or as deemed appropriate by one skilled in the art for a particular antibody of interest.

The invention also provides immunoconjugates interchangeably referred to as antibody drug conjugates or ADCs comprising any of the anti Robo4 antibodies of the invention conjugated to one or more cytotoxic agents such as a chemotherapeutic agent a drug a growth inhibitory agent a toxin e.g. an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial fungal plant or animal origin or fragments thereof or a radioactive isotope i.e. a radioconjugate . Conjugates of an antibody and one or more small molecule toxins such as a calicheamicin maytansinoids a trichothecene and CC1065 and the derivatives of these toxins that have toxin activity are also contemplated herein.

In certain embodiments an immunoconjugate comprises an anti Robo4 antibody and a chemotherapeutic agent or other toxin. Chemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of immunoconjugates are described herein e.g. above . Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof can also be used and are described herein.

In certain embodiments an immunoconjugate comprises an anti Robo4 antibody and one or more small molecule toxins including but not limited to small molecule drugs such as a calicheamicin maytansinoid dolastatin auristatin trichothecene and CC1065 and the derivatives of these drugs that have cytotoxic activity. Examples of such immunoconjugates are discussed in further detail below.

An immunoconjugate or antibody drug conjugate ADC of the invention may be of Formula I below wherein an anti Robo4 antibody is conjugated i.e. covalently attached to one or more drug moieties D through an optional linker L . Ab L D Formula I

Accordingly the anti Robo4 antibody may be conjugated to the drug either directly or via a linker. In Formula I p is the average number of drug moieties per antibody which can range e.g. from about 1 to about 20 drug moieties per antibody and in certain embodiments from 1 to about 8 drug moieties per antibody.

Exemplary linkers and drug moieties are disclosed herein and in U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 20050238649 A1 20050276812 A1 and 20070092940 A1. A linker may comprise one or more linker components. Exemplary linker components include 6 maleimidocaproyl MC maleimidopropanoyl MP valine citrulline val cit or vc alanine phenylalanine ala phe p aminobenzyloxycarbonyl a PAB N Succinimidyl 4 2 pyridylthio pentanoate SPP N succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC and N Succinimidyl 4 iodo acetyl aminobenzoate SIAB N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP see e.g. Carlsson et al. 173 723 737 1978 N succinimidyl 4 2 pyridyldithio butanoate SPDB see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 563 304 N succinimidyl 4 methyl 4 2 5 nitro pyridyl dithio pentanoate SMNP and the polyethylene glycol derivative methoxy polyethylene oxide mPEO . Various linker components are known in the art some of which are described below.

A linker may be a cleavable linker facilitating release of a drug in the cell. For example an acid labile linker e.g. hydrazone protease sensitive e.g. peptidase sensitive linker photolabile linker dimethyl linker or disulfide containing linker Chari et al. Cancer Research 52 127 131 1992 U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 may be used.

In some embodiments a linker component may comprise a stretcher unit that links an antibody to another linker component or to a drug moiety. Exemplary stretcher units are shown below wherein the wavy line indicates sites of covalent attachment to an antibody another linker component or a drug moiety 

In some embodiments a linker component may comprise an amino acid unit. In one such embodiment the amino acid unit allows for cleavage of the linker by a protease thereby facilitating release of the drug from the immunoconjugate upon exposure to intracellular proteases such as lysosomal enzymes. See e.g. Doronina et al. 2003 . Nat. Biotechnol. 21 778 784. Exemplary amino acid units include but are not limited to a dipeptide a tripeptide a tetrapeptide and a pentapeptide. Exemplary dipeptides include valine citrulline vc or val cit alanine phenylalanine af or ala phe phenylalanine lysine fk or phe lys or N methyl valine citrulline Me val cit . Exemplary tripeptides include glycine valine citrulline gly val cit and glycine glycine glycine gly gly gly . An amino acid unit may comprise amino acid residues that occur naturally as well as minor amino acids and non naturally occurring amino acid analogs such as citrulline. Amino acid units can be designed and optimized in their selectivity for enzymatic cleavage by a particular enzyme for example a tumor associated protease cathepsin B C and D or a plasmin protease.

In some embodiments a linker component may comprise a spacer unit that links the antibody to a drug moiety either directly or by way of a stretcher unit and or an amino acid unit. A spacer unit may be self immolative or a non self immolative. A non self immolative spacer unit is one in which part or all of the spacer unit remains bound to the drug moiety upon enzymatic e.g. proteolytic cleavage of the ADC. Examples of non self immolative spacer units include but are not limited to a glycine spacer unit and a glycine glycine spacer unit. Other combinations of peptidic spacers susceptible to sequence specific enzymatic cleavage are also contemplated. For example enzymatic cleavage of an ADC containing a glycine glycine spacer unit by a tumor cell associated protease would result in release of a glycine glycine drug moiety from the remainder of the ADC. In one such embodiment the glycine glycine drug moiety is then subjected to a separate hydrolysis step in the tumor cell thus cleaving the glycine glycine spacer unit from the drug moiety.

A self immolative spacer unit allows for release of the drug moiety without a separate hydrolysis step. In certain embodiments a spacer unit of a linker comprises a p aminobenzyl unit. In one such embodiment a p aminobenzyl alcohol is attached to an amino acid unit via an amide bond and a carbamate methylcarbamate or carbonate is made between the benzyl alcohol and a cytotoxic agent. See e.g. Hamann et al. 2005 Expert Opin. Ther. Patents 2005 15 1087 1103. In one embodiment the spacer unit is p aminobenzyloxycarbonyl PAB . In certain embodiments the phenylene portion of a p amino benzyl unit is substituted with Qm wherein Q is C Calkyl O C Calkyl halogen nitro or cyano and m is an integer ranging from 0 4. Examples of self immolative spacer units further include but are not limited to aromatic compounds that are electronically similar to p aminobenzyl alcohol see e.g. US 2005 0256030 A1 such as 2 aminoimidazol 5 methanol derivatives Hay et al. 1999 Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 9 2237 and ortho or para aminobenzylacetals. Spacers can be used that undergo cyclization upon amide bond hydrolysis such as substituted and unsubstituted 4 aminobutyric acid amides Rodrigues et al. Chemistry Biology 1995 2 223 appropriately substituted bicyclo 2.2.1 and bicyclo 2.2.2 ring systems Storm et al. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1972 94 5815 and 2 aminophenylpropionic acid amides Amsberry et al. J. Org. Chem. 1990 55 5867 . Elimination of amine containing drugs that are substituted at the a position of glycine Kingsbury et al. J. Med. Chem. 1984 27 1447 are also examples of self immolative spacers useful in ADCs.

In one embodiment a spacer unit is a branched bis hydroxymethyl styrene BHMS unit as depicted below which can be used to incorporate and release multiple drugs.

wherein Q is C Calkyl O C Calkyl halogen nitro or cyano m is an integer ranging from 0 4 n is 0 or 1 and p ranges raging from 1 to about 20.

A linker may comprise any one or more of the above linker components. In certain embodiments a linker is as shown in brackets in the following ADC Formula II Ab Aa Ww Yy D Formula II

wherein A is a stretcher unit and a is an integer from 0 to 1 W is an amino acid unit and w is an integer from 0 to 12 Y is a spacer unit and y is 0 1 or 2 and Ab D and p are defined as above for Formula I. Exemplary embodiments of such linkers are described in US 20050238649 A1 which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.

Exemplary linker components and combinations thereof are shown below in the context of ADCs of Formula II 

Linkers components including stretcher spacer and amino acid units may be synthesized by methods known in the art such as those described in US 2005 0238649 A1.

In some embodiments an immunoconjugate comprises an antibody of the invention conjugated to one or more maytansinoid molecules. Maytansinoids are mitototic inhibitors which act by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Maytansine was first isolated from the east African shrub U.S. Pat. No. 3 896 111 . Subsequently it was discovered that certain microbes also produce maytansinoids such as maytansinol and C 3 maytansinol esters U.S. Pat. No. 4 151 042 . Synthetic maytansinol and derivatives and analogues thereof are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 137 230 4 248 870 4 256 746 4 260 608 4 265 814 4 294 757 4 307 016 4 308 268 4 308 269 4 309 428 4 313 946 4 315 929 4 317 821 4 322 348 4 331 598 4 361 650 4 364 866 4 424 219 4 450 254 4 362 663 and 4 371 533 the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference.

Maytansine compounds inhibit cell proliferation by inhibiting the formation of microtubules during mitosis through inhibition of polymerization of the microtubulin protein tubulin Remillard et al. 1975 Science 189 1002 1005 U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 . Maytansine and maytansinoids are highly cytotoxic but their clinical use in cancer therapy has been greatly limited by their severe systemic side effects primarily attributed to their poor selectivity for tumors. Clinical trials with maytansine had been discontinued due to serious adverse effects on the central nervous system and gastrointestinal system Issel et al. 1978 Can. Treatment. Rev. 5 199 207 .

Maytansinoid drug moieties are attractive drug moieties in antibody drug conjugates because they are i relatively accessible to prepare by fermentation or chemical modification or derivatization of fermentation products ii amenable to derivatization with functional groups suitable for conjugation through non disulfide linkers to antibodies iii stable in plasma and iv effective against a variety of tumor cell lines.

Maytansine compounds suitable for use as maytansinoid drug moieties are well known in the art and can be isolated from natural sources according to known methods or produced using genetic engineering techniques see Yu et al. 2002 PNAS 99 7968 7973 . Maytansinol and maytansinol analogues may also be prepared synthetically according to known methods. Exemplary embodiments of maytansinoid drug moieties include DM1 DM3 and DM4 as disclosed herein below.

As with other drug moieties all stereoisomers of the maytansinoid drug moiety are contemplated for the compounds of the invention i.e. any combination of R and S configurations at the chiral carbons of D. In one embodiment the maytansinoid drug moiety D will have the following stereochemistry 

Exemplary embodiments of maytansinoid drug moieties include DM1 CR CHCH DM3 CR CHCHCH CH and DM4 CR CHCHC CH having the structures 

In an attempt to improve the therapeutic index of targeted antibodies maytansine and maytansinoids have been conjugated to antibodies specifically binding to tumor cell antigens. Immunoconjugates containing maytansinoids and their therapeutic use are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 208 020 5 416 064 and European Patent EP 0 425 235 B1 the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Liu et al. 93 8618 8623 1996 described immunoconjugates comprising a maytansinoid designated DM1 linked to the monoclonal antibody C242 directed against human colorectal cancer. The conjugate was found to be highly cytotoxic towards cultured colon cancer cells and showed antitumor activity in an in vivo tumor growth assay. Chari et al. 52 127 131 1992 describe immunoconjugates in which a maytansinoid was conjugated via a disulfide linker to the murine antibody A7 binding to an antigen on human colon cancer cell lines or to another murine monoclonal antibody TA.1 that binds the HER 2 neu oncogene. The cytotoxicity of the TA.1 maytansonoid conjugate was tested in vitro on the human breast cancer cell line SK BR 3 which expresses 3 10HER 2 surface antigens per cell. The drug conjugate achieved a degree of cytotoxicity similar to the free maytansinoid drug which could be increased by increasing the number of maytansinoid molecules per antibody molecule. The A7 maytansinoid conjugate showed low systemic cytotoxicity in mice.

Antibody maytansinoid conjugates are prepared by chemically linking an antibody to a maytansinoid molecule without significantly diminishing the biological activity of either the antibody or the maytansinoid molecule. An average of 3 4 maytansinoid molecules conjugated per antibody molecule has shown efficacy in enhancing cytotoxicity of target cells without negatively affecting the function or solubility of the antibody although even one molecule of toxin antibody would be expected to enhance cytotoxicity over the use of naked antibody. Maytansinoids are well known in the art and can be synthesized by known techniques or isolated from natural sources. Suitable maytansinoids are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 and in the other patents and nonpatent publications referred to hereinabove. Preferred maytansinoids are maytansinol and maytansinol analogues modified in the aromatic ring or at other positions of the maytansinol molecule such as various maytansinol esters.

There are many linking groups known in the art for making antibody maytansinoid conjugates including for example those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 or EP Patent 0 425 235 B1 and Chari et al. 52 127 131 1992 . The linking groups include disulfide groups thioether groups acid labile groups photolabile groups peptidase labile groups or esterase labile groups as disclosed in the above identified patents disulfide and thioether groups being preferred.

Conjugates of the antibody and maytansinoid may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . Particularly preferred coupling agents include N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP Carlsson et al 173 723 737 1978 and N succinimidyl 4 2 pyridylthio pentanoate SPP to provide for a disulfide linkage.

The linker may be attached to the maytansinoid molecule at various positions depending on the type of the link. For example an ester linkage may be formed by reaction with a hydroxyl group using conventional coupling techniques. The reaction may occur at the C 3 position having a hydroxyl group the C 14 position modified with hydroxymethyl the C 15 position modified with a hydroxyl group and the C 20 position having a hydroxyl group. In a preferred embodiment the linkage is formed at the C 3 position of maytansinol or a maytansinol analogue.

See Doronina et al. 2006 Bioconjugate Chem. 17 114 124. In such instances drug release is believed to be effected by antibody degradation in the cell. Id.

Typically peptide based drug moieties can be prepared by forming a peptide bond between two or more amino acids and or peptide fragments. Such peptide bonds can be prepared for example according to the liquid phase synthesis method see E. Schroder and K. L bke The Peptides volume 1 pp 76 136 1965 Academic Press that is well known in the field of peptide chemistry. Auristatin dolastatin drug moieties may be prepared according to the methods of US 2005 0238649 A1 U.S. Pat. No. 5 635 483 U.S. Pat. No. 5 780 588 Pettit et al. 1989 J. Am. Chem.

Biotechnol. 21 7 778 784.

In particular auristatin dolastatin drug moieties of formula D such as MMAF and derivatives thereof may be prepared using methods described in US 2005 0238649 A1 and Doronina et al. 2006 Bioconjugate Chem. 17 114 124. Auristatin dolastatin drug moieties of formula D such as MMAE and derivatives thereof may be prepared using methods described in Doronina et al. 2003 Nat. Biotech. 21 778 784. Drug linker moieties MC MMAF MC MMAE MC vc PAB MMAF and MC vc PAB MMAE may be conveniently synthesized by routine methods e.g. as described in Doronina et al. 2003 Nat. Biotech. 21 778 784 and U.S. Patent Publication No. 20050238649 A1 and then conjugated to an antibody of interest.

Another immunoconjugate of interest comprises an antibody conjugated to one or more calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics is capable of producing double stranded DNA breaks at sub picomolar concentrations. For the preparation of conjugates of the calicheamicin family see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 712 374 5 714 586 5 739 116 5 767 285 5 770 701 5 770 710 5 773 001 5 877 296 all to American Cyanamid Company . Structural analogues of calicheamicin which may be used include but are not limited to N acetyl PSAG and Hinman et al. 53 3336 3342 1993 Lode et al. 58 2925 2928 1998 and the aforementioned U.S. patents to American Cyanamid . Another anti tumor drug that the antibody can be conjugated is QFA which is an antifolate. Both calicheamicin and QFA have intracellular sites of action and do not readily cross the plasma membrane. Therefore cellular uptake of these agents through antibody mediated internalization greatly enhances their cytotoxic effects.

Other antitumor agents that can be conjugated to the antibodies of the invention include BCNU streptozoicin vincristine and 5 fluorouracil the family of agents known collectively LL E33288 complex described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 053 394 5 770 710 as well as esperamicins U.S. Pat. No. 5 877 296 .

Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof which can be used include diphtheria A chain nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin proteins dianthin proteins proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S inhibitor curcin crotin sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes. See for example WO 93 21232 published Oct. 28 1993.

The present invention further contemplates an immunoconjugate formed between an antibody and a compound with nucleolytic activity e.g. a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease such as a deoxyribonuclease DNase .

For selective destruction of the tumor the antibody may comprise a highly radioactive atom. A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include At I I Y Re Re Sm Bi P Pband radioactive isotopes of Lu.

The radio or other labels may be incorporated in the conjugate in known ways. For example the peptide may be biosynthesized or may be synthesized by chemical amino acid synthesis using suitable amino acid precursors involving for example fluorine 19 in place of hydrogen. Labels such as Tcor I Re Reand Incan be attached via a cysteine residue in the peptide. Yttrium 90 can be attached via a lysine residue. The IODOGEN method Fraker et al. 1978 80 49 57 can be used to incorporate iodine 123. Monoclonal Antibodies in Immunoscintigraphy Chatal CRC Press 1989 describes other methods in detail.

Anti Robo4 antibodies of the invention may be conjugated to nanoparticulate agents which may in turn be conjugated to cytotoxic moieties. Suitable nanoparticular agents include but are not limited to microbubbles see Ellegala et al. 108 336 341 2003 also referred to as acoustically active lipospheres AALs see Tartis et al. 32 11 1771 80 2006 superparamagnetic agents liposomes perfluorocarbon nanoparticle emulsions WO2005014051 and dendrimers see Caruthers et al. 124 387 400 2006 and references cited therein all of which references are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety .

Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. 238 1098 1987 . Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94 11026. The linker may be a cleavable linker facilitating release of the cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example an acid labile linker peptidase sensitive linker photolabile linker dimethyl linker or disulfide containing linker Chari et al. 52 127 131 1992 U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 may be used.

The compounds of the invention expressly contemplate but are not limited to ADC prepared with cross linker reagents BMPS EMCS GMBS HBVS LC SMCC MBS MPBH SBAP SIA SIAB SMCC SMPB SMPH sulfo EMCS sulfo GMBS sulfo KMUS sulfo MBS sulfo SIAB sulfo SMCC and sulfo SMPB and SVSB succinimidyl 4 vinylsulfone benzoate which are commercially available e.g. from Pierce Biotechnology Inc. Rockford Ill. U.S.A . See pages 467 498 2003 2004 Applications Handbook and Catalog.

Drug loading is represented by p and is the average number of drug moieties per antibody in a molecule of Formula I Ia Ia or II. Drug loading may range from 1 to 20 drug moieties D per antibody. ADCs of Formula I include collections of antibodies conjugated with a range of drug moieties from 1 to 20. The average number of drug moieties per antibody in preparations of ADC from conjugation reactions may be characterized by conventional means such as mass spectroscopy ELISA assay and HPLC. The quantitative distribution of ADC in terms of p may also be determined. In some instances separation purification and characterization of homogeneous ADC where p is a certain value from ADC with other drug loadings may be achieved by means such as reverse phase HPLC or electrophoresis.

For some antibody drug conjugates p may be limited by the number of attachment sites on the antibody. For example where the attachment is a cysteine thiol as in the exemplary embodiments above an antibody may have only one or several cysteine thiol groups or may have only one or several sufficiently reactive thiol groups through which a linker may be attached. In certain embodiments higher drug loading e.g. p 5 may cause aggregation insolubility toxicity or loss of cellular permeability of certain antibody drug conjugates. In certain embodiments the drug loading for an ADC of the invention ranges from 1 to about 8 from about 2 to about 6 from about 3 to about 5 from about 3 to about 4 from about 3.1 to about 3.9 from about 3.2 to about 3.8 from about 3.2 to about 3.7 from about 3.2 to about 3.6 from about 3.3 to about 3.8 or from about 3.3 to about 3.7. Indeed it has been shown that for certain ADCs the optimal ratio of drug moieties per antibody may be less than 8 and may be about 2 to about 5. See US 2005 0238649 A1 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety .

In certain embodiments fewer than the theoretical maximum of drug moieties are conjugated to an antibody during a conjugation reaction. An antibody may contain for example lysine residues that do not react with the drug linker intermediate or linker reagent as discussed below. Generally antibodies do not contain many free and reactive cysteine thiol groups which may be linked to a drug moiety indeed most cysteine thiol residues in antibodies exist as disulfide bridges. In certain embodiments an antibody may be reduced with a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol DTT or tricarbonylethylphosphine TCEP under partial or total reducing conditions to generate reactive cysteine thiol groups. In certain embodiments an antibody is subjected to denaturing conditions to reveal reactive nucleophilic groups such as lysine or cysteine.

The loading drug antibody ratio of an ADC may be controlled in different ways e.g. by i limiting the molar excess of drug linker intermediate or linker reagent relative to antibody ii limiting the conjugation reaction time or temperature iii partial or limiting reductive conditions for cysteine thiol modification iv engineering by recombinant techniques the amino acid sequence of the antibody such that the number and position of cysteine residues is modified for control of the number and or position of linker drug attachements such as thioMab or thioFab prepared as disclosed herein and in WO2006 034488 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . In an embodiment of the invention an amino acid residue of the antibody of the invention is substituted with a cysteine residue. In an embodiment the amino acid at position 118 of the heavy chain Fc region of the antibody is a cysteine or is substituted with a cysteine residue where 118 refers to the amino acid position in the Fc region of the antibody numbered according to EU numbering see Kabat E. A. et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest U.S. Dept. of Health and Hum. Serv. Bethesda 1991 . In an embodiment the cysteine residue at position 118 of the heavy chain Fc region EU numbering is covalently attached to a drug moiety or a detectable label such as the drug moieties or detectable labels disclosed herein. In the alanine of the heavy chain Fc region shown in bold text and underlined is the position at which a cysteine was substituted to generate the thioMAb.

It is to be understood that where more than one nucleophilic group reacts with a drug linker intermediate or linker reagent followed by drug moiety reagent then the resulting product is a mixture of ADC compounds with a distribution of one or more drug moieties attached to an antibody. The average number of drugs per antibody may be calculated from the mixture by a dual ELISA antibody assay which is specific for antibody and specific for the drug. Individual ADC molecules may be identified in the mixture by mass spectroscopy and separated by HPLC e.g. hydrophobic interaction chromatography see e.g. Hamblett K. J. et al. Effect of drug loading on the pharmacology pharmacokinetics and toxicity of an anti CD30 antibody drug conjugate Abstract No. 624 American Association for Cancer Research 2004 Annual Meeting Mar. 27 31 2004 Proceedings of the AACR Volume 45 March 2004 Alley S. C. et al. Controlling the location of drug attachment in antibody drug conjugates Abstract No. 627 American Association for Cancer Research 2004 Annual Meeting Mar. 27 31 2004 Proceedings of the AACR Volume 45 March 2004 . In certain embodiments a homogeneous ADC with a single loading value may be isolated from the conjugation mixture by electrophoresis or chromatography.

Also falling within the scope of this invention are the in vivo metabolic products of the ADC compounds described herein to the extent such products are novel and unobvious over the prior art. Such products may result for example from the oxidation reduction hydrolysis amidation esterification enzymatic cleavage and the like of the administered compound. Accordingly the invention includes novel and unobvious compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof.

Metabolite products typically are identified by preparing a radiolabeled e.g. C or H ADC administering it parenterally in a detectable dose e.g. greater than about 0.5 mg kg to an animal such as rat mouse guinea pig monkey or to man allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours and isolating its conversion products from the urine blood or other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite . The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion e.g. by MS LC MS or NMR analysis. In general analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well known to those skilled in the art. The conversion products so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the ADC compounds of the invention.

In the antibody drug conjugates ADC of the invention an antibody Ab is conjugated to one or more drug moieties D e.g. about 1 to about 20 drug moieties per antibody through a linker L . An ADC of Formula I Ia Ia or II may be prepared by several routes employing organic chemistry reactions conditions and reagents known to those skilled in the art including 1 reaction of a nucleophilic group of an antibody with a bivalent linker reagent to form Ab L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with a drug moiety D and 2 reaction of a nucleophilic group of a drug moiety with a bivalent linker reagent to form D L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with a nucleophilic group of an antibody. Exemplary methods for preparing an ADC of Formula I via the latter route are described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20050238649 A1 which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.

Nucleophilic groups on antibodies include but are not limited to i N terminal amine groups ii side chain amine groups e.g. lysine iii side chain thiol groups e.g. cysteine and iv sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine thiol and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT dithiothreitol or tricarbonylethylphosphine TCEP such that the antibody is fully or partially reduced. Each cysteine bridge will thus form theoretically two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through modification of lysine residues e.g. by reacting lysine residues with 2 iminothiolane Traut s reagent resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol. Reactive thiol groups may be introduced into an antibody by introducing one two three four or more cysteine residues e.g. by preparing variant antibodies comprising one or more non native cysteine amino acid residues .

Antibody drug conjugates of the invention may also be produced by reaction between an electrophilic group on an antibody such as an aldehyde or ketone carbonyl group with a nucleophilic group on a linker reagent or drug. Useful nucleophilic groups on a linker reagent include but are not limited to hydrazide oxime amino hydrazine thiosemicarbazone hydrazine carboxylate and arylhydrazide. In one embodiment an antibody is modified to introduce electrophilic moieties that are capable of reacting with nucleophilic substituents on the linker reagent or drug. In another embodiment the sugars of glycosylated antibodies may be oxidized e.g. with periodate oxidizing reagents to form aldehyde or ketone groups which may react with the amine group of linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting imine Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage or may be reduced e.g. by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated antibody with either galactose oxidase or sodium meta periodate may yield carbonyl aldehyde and ketone groups in the antibody that can react with appropriate groups on the drug Hermanson Bioconjugate Techniques . In another embodiment antibodies containing N terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium meta periodate resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid Geoghegan Stroh 1992 Bioconjugate Chem. 3 138 146 U.S. Pat. No. 5 362 852 . Such an aldehyde can be reacted with a drug moiety or linker nucleophile.

Nucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include but are not limited to amine thiol hydroxyl hydrazide oxime hydrazine thiosemicarbazone hydrazine carboxylate and arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups.

The compounds of the invention expressly contemplate but are not limited to ADC prepared with the following cross linker reagents BMPS EMCS GMBS HBVS LC SMCC MBS MPBH SBAP SIA SIAB SMCC SMPB SMPH sulfo EMCS sulfo GMBS sulfo KMUS sulfo MBS sulfo SIAB sulfo SMCC and sulfo SMPB and SVSB succinimidyl 4 vinylsulfone benzoate which are commercially available e.g. from Pierce Biotechnology Inc. Rockford Ill. U.S.A see pages 467 498 2003 2004 Applications Handbook and Catalog.

Immunoconjugates comprising an antibody and a cytotoxic agent may also be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. Science 238 1098 1987 . Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94 11026.

Alternatively a fusion protein comprising an antibody and a cytotoxic agent may be made e.g. by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. A recombinant DNA molecule may comprise regions encoding the antibody and cytotoxic portions of the conjugate either adjacent to one another or separated by a region encoding a linker peptide which does not destroy the desired properties of the conjugate.

A cysteine engineered antibody comprises one or more free cysteine amino acids having a thiol reactivity value in the range of 0.6 to 1.0.

Cysteine engineered antibodies may be useful in the treatment of cancer and include antibodies specific for cell surface and transmembrane receptors and tumor associated antigens TAA . Such antibodies may be used as naked antibodies unconjugated to a drug or label moiety or as Formula I Ia Ia or II antibody drug conjugates ADC .

Embodiments of the methods for preparing and screening a cysteine engineered antibody include where the parent antibody is an antibody fragment such as hu4D5Fabv8. The parent antibody may also be a fusion protein comprising an albumin binding peptide sequence ABP .

Cysteine engineered antibodies of the invention may be site specifically and efficiently coupled with a thiol reactive reagent. The thiol reactive reagent may be a multifunctional linker reagent a capture label reagent a fluorophore reagent or a drug linker intermediate.

The cysteine engineered antibody may be labeled with a detectable label immobilized on a solid phase support and or conjugated with a drug moiety.

Another aspect of the invention is an antibody drug conjugate compound comprising a cysteine engineered antibody Ab and a drug moiety D wherein the cysteine engineered antibody is attached through one or more free cysteine amino acids by a linker moiety L to D the compound having Formula Ia Ab LD Ia where p is 1 2 3 or 4 and wherein the cysteine engineered antibody is prepared by a process comprising replacing one or more amino acid residues of a parent antibody by one or more free cysteine amino acids. Drug moieties include but are not limited to a maytansinoid an auristatin a dolastatin a trichothecene CC1065 a calicheamicin and other enediyne antibiotics a taxane an anthracycline and stereoisomers isosteres analogs or derivatives thereof. Exemplary drug moieties include DM1 MMAE and MMAF. Exemplary antibody drug conjugates are set forth in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20070092940 A1.

The antibody drug conjugate of Formula Ia may further comprise an albumin binding peptide ABP sequence the composition having Formula Ia ABPAb LD Ia 

Antibodies of the invention comprising fusion proteins with ABP sequences are taught by i Dennis et al. 2002 J Biol. Chem. 277 35035 35043 at Tables III and IV page 35038 ii US 20040001827 at 0076 SEQ ID NOS 9 22 and iii WO 01 45746 at pages 12 13 SEQ ID NOS z1 z14 and all of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The compounds of the invention include cysteine engineered antibodies where one or more amino acids of a wild type or parent antibody are replaced with a cysteine amino acid. Any form of antibody may be so engineered i.e. mutated. For example a parent Fab antibody fragment may be engineered to form a cysteine engineered Fab referred to herein as ThioFab. Similarly a parent monoclonal antibody may be engineered to form a ThioMab. It should be noted that a single site mutation yields a single engineered cysteine residue in a ThioFab while a single site mutation yields two engineered cysteine residues in a ThioMab due to the dimeric nature of the IgG antibody. Mutants with replaced engineered cysteine Cys residues are evaluated for the reactivity of the newly introduced engineered cysteine thiol groups. The thiol reactivity value is a relative numerical term in the range of 0 to 1.0 and can be measured for any cysteine engineered antibody. Thiol reactivity values of cysteine engineered antibodies of the invention are in the ranges of 0.6 to 1.0 0.7 to 1.0 or 0.8 to 1.0.

The design selection and preparation methods of the invention enable cysteine engineered antibodies which are reactive with electrophilic functionality. These methods further enable antibody conjugate compounds such as antibody drug conjugate ADC compounds with drug molecules at designated designed selective sites. Reactive cysteine residues on an antibody surface allow specifically conjugating a drug moiety through a thiol reactive group such as maleimide or haloacetyl. The nucleophilic reactivity of the thiol functionality of a Cys residue to a maleimide group is about 1000 times higher compared to any other amino acid functionality in a protein such as amino group of lysine residues or the N terminal amino group. Thiol specific functionality in iodoacetyl and maleimide reagents may react with amine groups but higher pH 9.0 and longer reaction times are required Garman 1997 Non Radioactive Labelling A Practical Approach Academic Press London .

Cysteine engineered antibodies of the invention preferably retain the antigen binding capability of their wild type parent antibody counterparts. Thus cysteine engineered antibodies are capable of binding preferably specifically to antigens. Such antigens include for example tumor associated antigens TAA cell surface receptor proteins and other cell surface molecules transmembrane proteins signalling proteins cell survival regulatory factors cell proliferation regulatory factors molecules associated with for e.g. known or suspected to contribute functionally to tissue development or differentiation lymphokines cytokines molecules involved in cell cycle regulation molecules involved in vasculogenesis and molecules associated with for e.g. known or suspected to contribute functionally to angiogenesis. The tumor associated antigen may be a cluster differentiation factor i.e. a CD protein . An antigen to which a cysteine engineered antibody is capable of binding may be a member of a subset of one of the above mentioned categories wherein the other subset s of said category comprise other molecules antigens that have a distinct characteristic with respect to the antigen of interest .

The parent antibody may also be a human or humanized anti Robo4 antibody or Fab having any one two three four five or six of the HVR sequences disclosed herein. Cysteine engineered antibodies of the invention may be site specifically and efficiently coupled with a thiol reactive reagent. The thiol reactive reagent may be a multifunctional linker reagent a capture i.e. affinity label reagent e.g. a biotin linker reagent a detection label e.g. a fluorophore reagent a solid phase immobilization reagent e.g. SEPHAROSE polystyrene or glass or a drug linker intermediate. One example of a thiol reactive reagent is N ethyl maleimide NEM . In an exemplary embodiment reaction of a ThioFab with a biotin linker reagent provides a biotinylated ThioFab by which the presence and reactivity of the engineered cysteine residue may be detected and measured. Reaction of a ThioFab with a multifunctional linker reagent provides a ThioFab with a functionalized linker which may be further reacted with a drug moiety reagent or other label. Reaction of a ThioFab with a drug linker intermediate provides a ThioFab drug conjugate.

Such an approach may be applied to the conjugation of other thiol reactive agents in which the reactive group is for example a maleimide an iodoacetamide a pyridyl disulfide or other thiol reactive conjugation partner Haugland 2003 Molecular Probes Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals Molecular Probes Inc.

The partner may be a cytotoxic agent e.g. a toxin such as doxorubicin or pertussis toxin a fluorophore such as a fluorescent dye like fluorescein or rhodamine a chelating agent for an imaging or radiotherapeutic metal a peptidyl or non peptidyl label or detection tag or a clearance modifying agent such as various isomers of polyethylene glycol a peptide that binds to a third component or another carbohydrate or lipophilic agent.

The sites identified on the exemplary antibody fragment are primarily in the constant domain of an antibody which is well conserved across all species of antibodies. These sites should be broadly applicable to other antibodies without further need of structural design or knowledge of specific antibody structures and without interference in the antigen binding properties inherent to the variable domains of the antibody.

The PHESELECTOR assay Phage ELISA for Selection of Reactive Thiols disclosed in WO2006 034488 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety allows for detection of reactive cysteine groups in antibodies in an ELISA phage format. The process of coating the protein e.g. antibody of interest on well surfaces followed incubation with phage particles and then HRP labeled secondary antibody with absorbance detection is detailed in WO2006 034488. Mutant proteins displayed on phage may be screened in a rapid robust and high throughput manner. Libraries of cysteine engineered antibodies can be produced and subjected to binding selection using the same approach to identify appropriately reactive sites of free Cys incorporation from random protein phage libraries of antibodies or other proteins. This technique includes reacting cysteine mutant proteins displayed on phage with an affinity reagent or reporter group which is also thiol reactive.

Cysteine engineered antibodies which may be useful in the treatment of cancer include but are not limited to antibodies against cell surface receptors and tumor associated antigens TAA . Such antibodies may be used as naked antibodies unconjugated to a drug or label moiety or as Formula I Ia Ia or II antibody drug conjugates ADC . Tumor associated antigens are known in the art and can prepared for use in generating antibodies using methods and information which are well known in the art. In attempts to discover effective cellular targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy researchers have sought to identify transmembrane or otherwise tumor associated polypeptides that are specifically expressed on the surface of one or more particular type s of cancer cell as compared to on one or more normal non cancerous cell s or expressed on the surface of angiogenic cells such as vascular endothelial cells as compared to non endothelial cells unassociated with cancer. Often such tumor associated polypeptides are more abundantly expressed on the surface of the cancer cells or angiogenic cells as compared to on the surface of the non cancerous cells or non angiogenic cells. The identification of such tumor associated cell surface antigen polypeptides has given rise to the ability to specifically target cancer cells or angiogenic cells for destruction via antibody based therapies.

In yet another embodiment an antibody may be conjugated to a receptor such as streptavidin for utilization in tumor pre targeting wherein the antibody receptor conjugate is administered to the patient followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a ligand e.g. avidin which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent e.g. a radionucleotide .

It is contemplated that the anti Robo4 antibodies including e.g. naked anti Robo4 antibodies and ADC of the present invention may be used to treat various diseases or disorders e.g. characterized by the overexpression of a tumor or angiogenesis associated antigen such as Robo4. Exemplary conditions of hyperproliferative disorders include pathological conditions associated with abnormal or unwanted endothelial cell proliferation such as abnormal or unwanted vascular cell proliferation in disorders including but not limited to cancer angiogenesis and disorders associated with e.g. augmented by endothelial cell proliferation within the tissue experiencing the disorder solid tumors and metastasis atherosclerosis retrolental fibroplasia hemangiomas chronic inflammation intraocular neovascular diseases such as proliferative retinopathies e.g. diabetic retinopathy age related macular degeneration AMD neovascular glaucoma immune rejection of transplanted corneal tissue and other tissues rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.

The anti Robo4 antibodies and ADC compounds which are identified in animal models and cell based assays can be further tested in tumor bearing higher primates and human clinical trials. Human clinical trials can be designed to test the efficacy of the anti Robo4 monoclonal antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention in patients experiencing a cell proliferative disorder including without limitation pathological conditions associated with abnormal or unwanted endothelial cell proliferation such as abnormal or unwanted vascular cell proliferation in disorders including but not limited to cancer angiogenesis and disorders associated with e.g. augmented by endothelial cell proliferation within the tissue experiencing the disorder solid tumors and metastasis atherosclerosis retrolental fibroplasia hemangiomas chronic inflammation intraocular neovascular diseases such as proliferative retinopathies e.g. diabetic retinopathy age related macular degeneration AMD neovascular glaucoma immune rejection of transplanted corneal tissue and other tissues rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. The clinical trial may be designed to evaluate the efficacy of an anti Robo4 antibody in combinations with known therapeutic regimens such as radiation and or chemotherapy involving known chemotherapeutic and or cytotoxic agents.

The cancer may comprise Robo4 expressing cells such that an anti Robo4 antibody of the present invention is able to bind to the Robo4 expressing endothelial cells within the cancer tissue. To determine Robo4 expression in the cancer various diagnostic prognostic assays are available. In one embodiment Robo4 overexpression may be analyzed by IHC. Paraffin embedded tissue sections from a tumor biopsy may be subjected to the IHC assay and accorded a Robo4 protein staining intensity criteria with respect to the degree of staining and in what proportion of tumor cells examined. In one embodiment Robo4 overexpression may be analyzed by detection in vivo or in vitro of anti Robo4 antibody labeled with a detectable marker contacted with Robo4 expressing cells in vivo. Detectable markers include without limitation radioisotopes fluorescent compounds metallic and or magnetic nanoparticles microbubbles chelating ligands and other detectable markers as disclosed herein.

For the prevention or treatment of disease the appropriate dosage of an anti Robo4 antibody will depend on the type of disease to be treated as defined above the severity and course of the disease whether the molecule is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes previous therapy the patient s clinical history and response to the antibody and the discretion of the attending physician. The molecule is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease about 1 g kg to 15 mg kg e.g. 0.1 20 mg kg of molecule is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient whether for example by one or more separate administrations or by continuous infusion. A typical daily dosage might range from about 1 g kg to 100 mg kg or more depending on the factors mentioned above. An exemplary dosage of ADC to be administered to a patient is in the range of about 0.1 to about 10 mg kg of patient weight.

For repeated administrations over several days or longer depending on the condition the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg kg followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg kg of an anti Robo4 antibody. Other dosage regimens may be useful. In yet another embodiment the dosage range is 275 375 mg m2 The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.

The anti Robo4 antibodies and adjunct therapeutic agent of the invention may be administered by any route appropriate to the condition to be treated including parenteral subcutaneous intraperitoneal intrapulmonary and intranasal and if desired for local treatment intralesional administration. The anti Robo4 antibodies will typically be administered parenterally i.e. infusion subcutaneous intramuscular intravenous intradermal intrathecal epidural intraarterial and intraperitoneal. In addition the antibody is suitably administered by pulse infusion particularly with declining doses of the antibody. Dosing can be by any suitable route e.g. by injections such as intravenous or subcutaneous injections depending in part on whether the administration is brief or chronic.

For treating cancers or any disease in which angiogenisis occurs the anti Robo4 antibody or antibody drug conjugate is administered via intravenous infusion. The dosage administered via infusion is in the range of about 1 g mto about 10 000 g mper dose generally one dose per week for a total of one two three or four doses. Alternatively the dosage range is about 1 g mto about 1000 g m about 1 g mto about 800 g m about 1 g mto about 600 g m about 1 g mto about 400 g m about 10 g mto about 500 g m about 10 g mto about 300 g m about 10 g mto about 200 g m or about 1 g mto about 200 g m. The dose may be administered once per day once per week multiple times per week but less than once per day multiple times per month but less than once per day multiple times per month but less than once per week once per month or intermittently to relieve or alleviate symptoms of the disease. Administration may continue at any of the disclosed intervals until the symptoms of the disease or disorder being treated are reduced alleviated or eliminated e.g. as indicated by shrinkage of a tumor reduction of elimination of symptoms of lymphoma leukemia inhibition of metastatic spread without shrinkage of the primary tumor i.e. progression free survival inhibition of ocular neovascularization . Administration may continue after remission or relief of symptoms is achieved where such remission or relief is prolonged by such continued administration.

In one aspect the invention further provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising at least one anti Robo4 antibody of the invention and or at least one immunoconjugate thereof and or at least one anti Robo4 antibody drug conjugate of the invention. In some embodiments a pharmaceutical formulation comprises 1 an anti Robo4 antibody and or an anti Robo4 antibody drug conjugate and or an immunoconjugate thereof and 2 a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In some embodiments a pharmaceutical formulation comprises 1 an anti Robo4 antibody and or an immunoconjugate thereof and optionally 2 at least one additional therapeutic agent.

Pharmaceutical formulations comprising an antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention or the antibody drug conjugate of the invention are prepared for storage by mixing the antibody or antibody drug conjugate having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition Osol A. Ed. 1980 in the form of aqueous solutions or lyophilized or other dried formulations. Acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and include buffers such as phosphate citrate histidine and other organic acids antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine preservatives such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride hexamethonium chloride benzalkonium chloride benzethonium chloride phenol butyl or benzyl alcohol alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben catechol resorcinol cyclohexanol 3 pentanol and m cresol low molecular weight less than about 10 residues polypeptides proteins such as serum albumin gelatin or immunoglobulins hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone amino acids such as glycine glutamine asparagine histidine arginine or lysine monosaccharides disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose mannose or dextrins chelating agents such as EDTA sugars such as sucrose mannitol trehalose or sorbitol salt forming counter ions such as sodium metal complexes e.g. Zn protein complexes and or non ionic surfactants such as TWEEN PLURONICS or polyethylene glycol PEG . Pharmaceutical formulations to be used for in vivo administration are generally sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.

Active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsule prepared for example by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization for example hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin microcapsule and poly methylmethacylate microcapsule respectively in colloidal drug delivery systems for example liposomes albumin microspheres microemulsions nano particles and nanocapsules or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition Osol A. Ed. 1980 .

The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.

Sustained release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody or immunoconjugate of the invention which matrices are in the form of shaped articles e.g. films or microcapsule. Examples of sustained release matrices include polyesters hydrogels for example poly 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate or poly vinylalcohol polylactides U.S. Pat. No. 3 773 919 copolymers of L glutamic acid and y ethyl L glutamate non degradable ethylene vinyl acetate degradable lactic acid glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate and poly D 3 hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene vinyl acetate and lactic acid glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated antibodies or immunoconjugates remain in the body for a long time they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37 C. resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S S bond formation through thio disulfide interchange stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues lyophilizing from acidic solutions controlling moisture content using appropriate additives and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.

The formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.

An anti Robo4 antibodies of the invention may be combined in a pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen as combination therapy with at least one additional compound having anti cancer properties. The at least one additional compound of the pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen preferably has complementary activities to the anti Robo4 antibody composition such that they do not adversely affect each other.

The at least one additional compound may be a chemotherapeutic agent a cytotoxic agent a cytokine a growth inhibitory agent an anti hormonal agent and combinations thereof. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. A pharmaceutical composition containing an anti Robo4 antibody of the invention may also comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a chemotherapeutic agent such as a tubulin forming inhibitor a topoisomerase inhibitor or a DNA binder.

In one aspect the first compound is an anti Robo4 ADC of the invention and the at least one additional compound is a therapeutic antibody other than an anti Robo4 naked antibody or an ADC . In one embodiment the at least one additional compound is an antibody that binds a cancer cell surface marker. In one embodiment the at least one additional compound is an anti HER2 antibody trastuzumab e.g. Herceptin Genentech Inc. South San Francisco Calif. . In one embodiment the at least one additional compound is an anti HER2 antibody pertuzumab Omnitarg Genentech Inc. South San Francisco Calif. see U.S. Pat. No. 6 949 245 . In one embodiment the at least one additional compound is an anti VEGF antibody e.g. AVASTIN Genentech Inc. . In an embodiment the at least one additional compound is an antibody either a naked antibody or an ADC and the additional antibody is a second third fourth fifth sixth antibody or more such that a combination of such second third fourth fifth sixth or more antibodies either naked or as an ADC is efficacious in treating a cell proliferative disease in a tissue expressing Robo4.

Other therapeutic regimens may be combined with the administration of an anticancer agent identified in accordance with this invention including without limitation radiation therapy and or bone marrow and peripheral blood transplants and or a cytotoxic agent a chemotherapeutic agent or a growth inhibitory agent. In one of such embodiments a chemotherapeutic agent is an agent or a combination of agents such as for example cyclophosphamide hydroxydaunorubicin adriamycin doxorubincin vincristine ONCOVIN prednisolone CHOP CVP or COP or immunotherapeutics such as anti PSCA anti HER2 e.g. HERCEPTIN OMNITARG or anti VEGF e.g. AVASTIN . The combination therapy may be administered as a simultaneous or sequential regimen. When administered sequentially the combination may be administered in two or more administrations. The combined administration includes coadministration using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation and consecutive administration in either order wherein preferably there is a time period while both or all active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities.

In one embodiment treatment with an anti Robo4 antibody involves the combined administration of an anticancer agent identified herein and one or more chemotherapeutic agents or growth inhibitory agents including coadministration of cocktails of different chemotherapeutic agents. Chemotherapeutic agents include taxanes such as paclitaxel and docetaxel and or anthracycline antibiotics. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapeutic agents may be used according to manufacturer s instructions or as determined empirically by the skilled practitioner. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapy are also described in Chemotherapy Service 1992 Ed. M. C. Perry Williams Wilkins Baltimore Md.

Suitable dosages for any of the above coadministered agents are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action synergy of the newly identified agent and other chemotherapeutic agents or treatments.

The combination therapy may provide synergy and prove synergistic i.e. the effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect may be attained when the active ingredients are 1 co formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined unit dosage formulation 2 delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations or 3 by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy a synergistic effect may be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially e.g. by different injections in separate syringes. In general during alternation therapy an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially i.e. serially whereas in combination therapy effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together.

For the prevention or treatment of disease the appropriate dosage of an antibody of the invention when used alone or in combination with other agents such as chemotherapeutic agents will depend on the type of disease to be treated the type of antibody the severity and course of the disease whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes previous therapy the patient s clinical history and response to the antibody and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease about 1 g kg to 15 mg kg e.g. 0.1 mg kg 10 mg kg of antibody is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient whether for example by one or more separate administrations or by continuous infusion. One typical daily dosage might range from about 1 g kg to 100 mg kg or more depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer depending on the condition the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. One exemplary dosage of the antibody would be in the range from about 0.05 mg kg to about 10 mg kg. Thus one or more doses of about 0.5 mg kg 2.0 mg kg 4.0 mg kg or 10 mg kg or any combination thereof may be administered to the patient. Such doses may be administered intermittently e.g. every week or every three weeks e.g. such that the patient receives from about two to about twenty e.g. about six doses of the antibody . An initial higher loading dose followed by one or more lower doses may be administered. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg kg followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg kg of the antibody. However other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.

The invention also provides labeled anti Robo4 antibodies. Labeled antibodies may be useful in diagnostic assays e.g. in vitro ex vivo or in vivo assays for detecting expression of Robo4 in specific cells or tissues e.g. to image angiogenesis neovascularization and or tumor vasculature . In some embodiments the labeled antibodies are used in in vivo imaging assays. The anti Robo4 antibodies of the invention may be conjugated with any label moiety which can be covalently attached to the antibody. In some embodiments the anti Robo4 antibodies of the invention including e.g. the cysteine engineered anti Robo4 antibodies are covalently attached to the antibody through a reactive group on the antibody such as a reactive lysine or cysteine residue. Covalent attachment through a reactive cysteine thiol group is disclosed in Singh et al. 304 147 15 2002 Harlow E. and Lane D. 1999 Using Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y.

 d In some embodiments the anti Robo4 antibodies are labeled with various enzyme substrate labels are available or disclosed U.S. Pat. No. 4 275 149 . The enzyme generally catalyzes a chemical alteration of a chromogenic substrate that can be measured using various techniques. For example the enzyme may catalyze a color change in a substrate which can be measured spectrophotometrically. Alternatively the enzyme may alter the fluorescence or chemiluminescence of the substrate. Techniques for quantifying a change in fluorescence are described above. The chemiluminescent substrate becomes electronically excited by a chemical reaction and may then emit light which can be measured using a chemiluminometer for example or donates energy to a fluorescent acceptor. Examples of enzymatic labels include luciferases e.g. firefly luciferase and bacterial luciferase U.S. Pat. No. 4 737 456 luciferin 2 3 dihydrophthalazinediones malate dehydrogenase urease peroxidase such as horseradish peroxidase HRP alkaline phosphatase AP galactosidase glucoamylase lysozyme saccharide oxidases e.g. glucose oxidase galactose oxidase and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase heterocyclic oxidases such as uricase and xanthine oxidase lactoperoxidase microperoxidase and the like. Techniques for conjugating enzymes to antibodies are described in O Sullivan et al. 1981 Methods for the Preparation of Enzyme Antibody Conjugates for use in Enzyme Immunoassay in . ed J. Langone H.

A label may be indirectly conjugated with an anti Robo4 antibody including e.g. a cysteine engineered anti Robo4 antibody . For example the anti Robo4 antibody can be conjugated with biotin and any of the three broad categories of labels mentioned above can be conjugated with avidin or streptavidin or vice versa. Biotin binds selectively to streptavidin and thus the label can be conjugated with the anti Robo4 antibody in this indirect manner. Alternatively to achieve indirect conjugation of the label with the anti Robo4 antibody the anti Robo4 antibody is conjugated with a small hapten e.g. digoxin and one of the different types of labels mentioned above is conjugated with an anti hapten polypeptide variant e.g. anti digoxin antibody . Thus indirect conjugation of the label with the anti Robo4 antibody can be achieved Hermanson G. 1996 in Academic Press San Diego .

The anti Robo4 antibody of the present invention may be employed in any known assay method such as ELISA competitive binding assays direct and indirect sandwich assays and immunoprecipitation assays Zola 1987 pp. 147 158 CRC Press Inc. .

The labeled anti Robo4 antibodies of the invention can detect cell surface receptors and are useful for localizing visualizing and quantitating endothelial cells e.g. tumor endothelial cells sites of angiogenesis sites of neovascularization and or tumor vasculature. Another use for detectably labeled antibodies is a method of bead based immunocapture comprising conjugating a bead with a fluorescent labeled antibody and detecting a fluorescence signal upon binding of a ligand. Similar binding detection methodologies utilize the surface plasmon resonance SPR effect to measure and detect antibody antigen interactions. The detectably labeled anti Robo4 antibody of the present invention may be employed in any known assay method such as ELISA competitive binding assays direct and indirect sandwich assays and immunoprecipitation assays Zola 1987 Monoclonal Antibodies A Manual of Techniques pp. 147 158 CRC Press Inc. .

Detection labels such as fluorescent dyes and chemiluminescent dyes Briggs et al . Perkin Trans. 1 1051 1058 1997 provide a detectable signal and are generally applicable for labelling antibodies preferably with the following properties i the labeled antibody should produce a very high signal with low background so that small quantities of antibodies can be sensitively detected in both cell free and cell based assays and ii the labeled antibody should be photostable so that the fluorescent signal may be observed monitored and recorded without significant photo bleaching. For applications involving cell surface binding of labeled antibody to membranes or cell surfaces especially live cells the labels preferably iii have good water solubility to achieve effective conjugate concentration and detection sensitivity and iv are non toxic to living cells so as not to disrupt the normal metabolic processes of the cells or cause premature cell death.

Labeled cysteine engineered antibodies of the invention are useful as imaging biomarkers and probes by the various methods and techniques of biomedical and molecular imaging such as i MRI magnetic resonance imaging ii X ray computed tomography iii SPECT single photon emission computed tomography iv PET positron emission tomography Chen et al. 2004 Bioconjugate Chem. 15 41 49 v bioluminescence vi fluorescence and vii ultrasound. Immunoscintigraphy is an imaging procedure in which antibodies labeled with radioactive substances are administered to an animal or human patient and a picture is taken of sites in the body e.g. tumors including tumor vasculature or metastases thereof where the antibody localizes U.S. Pat. No. 6 528 624 . Imaging biomarkers may be objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes pathogenic processes or pharmacological responses to a therapeutic intervention. Biomarkers may be of several types Type 0 are natural history markers of a disease and correlate longitudinally with known clinical indices e.g. MRI assessment of synovial inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis Type I markers capture the effect of an intervention in accordance with a mechanism of action even though the mechanism may not be associated with clinical outcome Type II markers function as surrogate endpoints where the change in or signal from the biomarker predicts a clinical benefit to validate the targeted response such as measured bone erosion in rheumatoid arthritis by planar X ray MRI or CT. Imaging biomarkers thus can provide pharmacodynamic PD therapeutic information about i expression of a target protein ii binding of a therapeutic to the target protein i.e. selectivity and iii clearance and half life pharmacokinetic data. Advantages of in vivo imaging biomarkers relative to lab based biomarkers include non invasive treatment quantifiable whole body assessment repetitive dosing and assessment i.e. multiple time points and potentially transferable effects from preclinical small animal to clinical human results. For some applications bioimaging supplants or minimizes the number of animal experiments in preclinical studies.

Peptides and proteins labeled with two moieties a fluorescent reporter and quencher in sufficient proximity undergo fluorescence resonance energy transfer FRET . Reporter groups are typically fluorescent dyes that are excited by light at a certain wavelength and transfer energy to an acceptor or quencher group with the appropriate Stokes shift for emission at maximal brightness. Fluorescent dyes include molecules with extended aromaticity such as fluorescein and rhodamine and their derivatives. The fluorescent reporter may be partially or significantly quenched by the quencher moiety in an intact peptide. Upon cleavage of the peptide by a peptidase or protease a detectable increase in fluorescence may be measured Knight C. 1995 Fluorimetric Assays of Proteolytic Enzymes Methods in Enzymology Academic Press 248 18 34 .

The anti Robo4 labeled antibodies of the invention may also be used as an affinity purification agent. In this process the labeled antibody is immobilized on a solid phase such a Sephadex resin or filter paper using methods well known in the art. The immobilized antibody is contacted with a sample containing the antigen to be purified and thereafter the support is washed with a suitable solvent that will remove substantially all the material in the sample except the antigen to be purified which is bound to the immobilized antibody. Finally the support is washed with another suitable solvent such as glycine buffer pH 5.0 that will release the antigen from the antibody.

Labelling reagents typically bear reactive functionality which may react i directly with a cysteine thiol of a cysteine engineered antibody to form the labeled antibody ii with a linker reagent to form a linker label intermediate or iii with a linker antibody to form the labeled antibody. Reactive functionality of labelling reagents include maleimide haloacetyl iodoacetamide succinimidyl ester e.g. NHS N hydroxysuccinimide isothiocyanate sulfonyl chloride 2 6 dichlorotriazinyl pentafluorophenyl ester and phosphoramidite although other functional groups can also be used.

An exemplary reactive functional group is N hydroxysuccinimidyl ester NHS of a carboxyl group substituent of a detectable label e.g. biotin or a fluorescent dye. The NHS ester of the label may be preformed isolated purified and or characterized or it may be formed in situ and reacted with a nucleophilic group of an antibody. Typically the carboxyl form of the label is activated by reacting with some combination of a carbodiimide reagent e.g. dicyclohexylcarbodiimide diisopropylcarbodiimide or a uronium reagent e.g. TSTU O N Succinimidyl N N N N tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate HBTU O benzotriazol 1 yl N N N N tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate or HATU O 7 azabenzotriazol 1 yl N N N N tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate an activator such as 1 hydroxybenzotriazole HOBt and N hydroxysuccinimide to give the NHS ester of the label. In some cases the label and the antibody may be coupled by in situ activation of the label and reaction with the antibody to form the label antibody conjugate in one step. Other activating and coupling reagents include TBTU 2 1H benzotriazo 1 yl 1 1 3 3 tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate TFFH N N N N tetramethyluronium 2 fluoro hexafluorophosphate PyBOP benzotriazole 1 yl oxy tris pyrrolidino phosphonium hexafluorophosphate EEDQ 2 ethoxy 1 ethoxycarbonyl 1 2 dihydro quinoline DCC dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DIPCDI diisopropylcarbodiimide MSNT 1 mesitylene 2 sulfonyl 3 nitro 1H 1 2 4 triazole and aryl sulfonyl halides e.g. triisopropylbenzenesulfonyl chloride.

The nucleic acid sequences of the VL and VH domains of the HERCEPTIN anti HER2 antibody rhuMAB 4D5 8 Genentech Inc. was used as the starting sequence for mutagenesis of the HVRs and phage selection for binding to human Robo4 His tagged antigen shown in or human Rob4 Fc fusion protein. Antibody 4D5 is a humanized antibody specific for a cancer associated antigen known as Her 2 erbB2 . The antibody includes variable domains having consensus framework regions a few positions were reverted to mouse sequence during the process of increasing affinity of the humanized antibody.

Biol. 2004 340 5 1073 93. The first open reading frame consists of the stII signal sequence fused to the VL and CH1 domains acceptor light chain and the second consists of the stII signal sequence fused to the VH and CH1 domains of the acceptor heavy chain followed by a truncated minor phage coat protein P3. See Lee et al. J. Mol. Biol. 2004 340 5 1073 93.

Fab clones YW71.6 YW71.1 YW71.22 and YW71.89 were generated by mutagenesis of HVR H1 H2 and H3 of huMAb 4D5 8 HERCEPTIN anti BER2 antibody Genentech Inc. heavy chain and selection against human Robo4 His tagged antigen fusion protein. In HVR H1 Kabat positions 26 G 27 F 28 T 29 I 34 I and 35 H were held constant and the amino acids at positions 30 33 were varied. In HVR H2 Kabat positions 51 I 52a P 55 G 57 T 59 Y 60 A 61 D 62 S 63 V 64 K and 65 G were held constant and positions 49 50 52 53 54 56 and 58 were varied. In HVR H3 Kabat positions 93 A and 102 Y were held constant and positions 94 100 100a h and 101 were varied. The light chain of YW71.22 was the modified huMAb 4D5 8 sequence modified at positions 30 66 and 91 resulting in SEQ ID NO 168 comprising SEQ ID NOS 1 2 and 3 as HVR L1 L2 and L3 respectively the HVRs of which were not varied during phage selection. Sequence diversity was introduced into each hypervariable region by mutagenesis of selected amino acid positions using standard mutagenesis techniques.

Generation of phage libraries Randomized oligonucleotide pools designed for each hypervariable region were phoshorylated separately in six 20 l reactions containing 660 ng of oligonucleotide 50 mM Tris pH 7.5 10 mM MgCl 1 mM ATP 20 mM DTT and 5 U polynucleotide kinase for 1 h at 37 C. The six phosphorylated oligonucleotide pools were then combined with 20 g of Kunkel template in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5 10 mM MgClin a final volume of 500 l resulting in an oligonucleotide to template ratio of 3. The mixture was annealed at 90 C. for 4 min 50 C. for 5 min and then cooled on ice. Excess unannealed oligonucleotide was removed with a QIAQUICK PCR purification kit Qiagen kit 28106 using a modified protocol to prevent excessive denaturation of the annealed DNA. To the 500 l of annealed mixture 150 l of PB was added and the mixture was split between 2 silica columns. Following a wash of each column with 750 l of PE and an extra spin to dry the columns each column was eluted with 110 l of 10 mM Tris 1 mM EDTA pH 8. The annealed and cleaned up template 220 l was then filled in by adding 1 l 100 mM ATP 10 l 25 mM dNTPs 25 mM each of dATP dCTP dGTP and dTTP 15 l 100 mM DTT 25 l 10 TM buffer 0.5 M Tris pH 7.5 0.1 M MgCl 2400 U T4 ligase and 30 U T7 polymerase for 3 h at room temperature.

The filled in product was analyzed on Tris Acetate EDTA agarose gels Sidhu et al. 328 333 363 2000 . Three bands were usually visible the bottom band is a correctly filled and ligated product the middle band is a filled but unligated product and the top band is a strand displaced product. The top band is produced by an intrinsic side activity of T7 polymerase and is difficult to avoid Lechner et al. 258 11174 11184 1983 however this band transforms 30 fold less efficiently than the bottom band and usually contributes little to the library. The middle band is due to the absence of a 5 phosphate for the final ligation reaction this band transforms efficiently and gives mainly wild type sequence.

The filled in product was then purified and electroporated into SS320 cells and propagated in the presence of M13 KO7 helper phage as described by Sidhu et al. 328 333 363 2000 . Library sizes ranged from 1 2 10independent clones. Random clones from the initial libraries were sequenced to assess library quality.

Phage Selection The human Robo4 Fc and Robo4 His tagged proteins were used as the selection antigens. Human Robo4 Fc and Robo4 His was coated on MaxiSorp microtiter plates Nunc at 10 g mil in PBS and incubated overnight at 4 degrees. For the first round of selection 12 wells of target were used. Wells were blocked for 1 hour at room temperature using Phage Blocking Buffer 1 BSA 0.05 Tween 20 PBS . Phage libraries were PEG precipitates from frozen glycerol stocks resuspended in Phage Blocking Buffer and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Phage libraries were then added to the blocked antigen plates incubated overnight at room temperature. After overnight binding unbound or non specifically bound phage were removed from the antigen plates by washing with Wash Buffer PBS 05 Tween 20 . Bound phage were eluted by incubating the wells with 50 mM HCl 0.5 M KCl for 30 min. Phage were amplified using XL 1 Blue cells and M13 KO7 helper phage and grown for 36 hours at 30 C. in 2YT 50 g mil carbanecillin 50 ug ml kanamycin 10 g ml tetracycline. Amplified phage were then recovered using a modified PEG precipitation protocol Clackson Lowman 2004 . The titers of phage eluted from a target coated well were compared to titers of phage recovered from a non target coated well to assess enrichment. Four rounds of phage selection were completed with the number of target wells decreasing to 4 round 2 and 2 round 3 and 4 . Casein Blocking Buffer Pierce was used as the blocking reagent for antigen plates and phage for rounds 2 and 4. Selection rounds 2 4 used a 3 4 hour phage antigen binding period and increased washing stringency. Four phage clones were selected YW71.6 YW7.1 YW71.22 and YW71.89. The sequences of the light and heavy chain domains were determined and are shown in . The Robo4 binding characteristics were determined as disclosed herein below.

Clones YW79.1 YW79.8 and YW79.11 were generated by mutagenesis of HVR H1 H2 H3 and L3 of huMAb 4D5 8 HERCEPTIN anti HER2 antibody Genentech Inc. heavy chain variable domain and huMAb 4D5 8 modified light chain variable domain SEQ ID NO 168. In HVR H1 Kabat positions 26 G 28 T 29 F 30 S 31 S and 35 S were held constant and the amino acids at positions 27 32 34 were varied. In HVR H2 Kabat positions 49 S 51 I 55 G 57 T 59 Y 60 A 61 D 62 S 63 V 64 K and 65 G were held constant and positions 50 52 52a 53 54 56 and 58 were varied. In HVR H3 Kabat positions 93 A 94 R 100f g deletion were held constant and positions 95 100 100a e 100h and 102 were varied. In HVR L3 Kabat positions 89 Q 90 Q 95 P and 97 T were held constant and positions 91 94 and 96 were varied. The sequence of HVR L1 was held constant as RASQSISSYLA SEQ ID NO 7 and the sequence of HVR L2 was held constant as GASSRAS SEQ ID NO 8 . Sequence diversity was introduced into each hypervariable region by mutagenesis of selected amino acid positions using standard mutagenesis techniques. Anti Robo4 antibody clones YW79.1 YW79.8 and YW79.11 were selected and sequenced. The sequences of the light chain and heavy chain variable regions are shown in .

This example describes methods useful in the purification of the Robo4 antigen and the anti Robo4 antibodies of the invention. Robo4 antigen was purified as a soluble Robo4 extracellular domain fused to a histidine tag as shown in .

Human Robo4 constructs amino acid M1 to amino acid L461 and amino acid M1 to amino acid Y231 were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pRK5 either as fusions to the Fc portion of human IgG1 or to a C terminal Histidine tag. Murine Robo4 M1 to H232 was cloned into pRK5 as fusion to a C terminal Histidine tag only. All proteins were produced by transient transfection of CHO cells. Proteins were purified to 90 purity by affinity chromatography using either protein A Sepharose GE Healthcare for Fc fusion proteins or NiNTA Superflow Qiagen for Histidine tag fusions. If necessary an ion exchange chromatography step Q or SP Sepharose GE Healthcare was added and or a size exclusion chromatography step Superdex 75 GE Healthcare . Protein identities were confirmed by N terminal sequencing using the Edman degradation method concentrations were determined by the BCA assay and by OD 280 absorption measurements and purity was assessed by size exclusion chromatography and SDS PAGE.

Full length Robo4 antibodies were transiently expressed in CHO cells and purified to 95 purity by affinity chromatography using protein A Sepharose GE Healthcare followed by ion exchange chromatography using SP Sepharose GE Healthcare . If necessary an additional size exclusion chromatography step Superdex 200 GE Healthcare was added. Antibody concentrations were determined by the BCA assay according to manufacturer s instructions Pierce Chemical Co. and by OD 280 absorption measurements and purity was assessed by size exclusion chromatography and SDS PAGE. For all antibody purifications aggregate levels as determined by laser light scattering were below 5 protein A levels as determined by protein A ELISA were below 50 ppm and endotoxin levels as determined by the LAL Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate chromogenic endotoxin assay were below 0.5 EU mg.

To improve the affinity of anti Robo4 antibody YW71.22 three phage display libraries were generated in the background of YW71.22 each targeting multiple HVRs for soft randomization mutagenesis as described in Lee et al. J. Mol. Biol. 340 5 1073 93 2004 . To avoid re selecting YW71.22 from a potential high background of template stop codons were introduced into the HVR to be mutated prior to generating each library. A solution sorting method was used to enhance the efficiency of the affinity based phage selection process. By manipulating the biotinylated target concentration reducing the phage capture time to lower backgrounds and the addition of unbiotinylated target to eliminate clones with faster off rates high affinity clones can be proficiently selected. Lee et al. J. Mol. Biol. 2004 340 5 1073 93. From the first round of selection enrichment target dependent phage capture was observed suggesting a large number of clones were present in each library with reasonably high affinity for human Robo4. Selection stringency was increased in subsequent rounds. After 5 rounds of selection clones from each library were analyzed. New sequences were observed in libraries targeting each of the six HVRs . Selected clones were screened by phage ELISA and then expressed as IgG protein and their affinity characterized using Biacore binding analysis.

Phage libraries of affinity matured clones were sorted using a solid solution sorting method. Human Robo4 His was biotinylated by mixing 500 l of 3.6 mg ml human Robo4 His in PBS and 10 l of 1 M potassium phosphate pH 8 with 20 l 4 mM Sulfo NHS LC biotin Pierce . For the first round of selection biotinylated Robo4 His was coated on MaxiSorp microtiter plates Nunc at 10 g ml in PBS and incubated overnight at 4 C. For the first round of selection 16 wells of target were used. Wells were blocked for 1 hour at room temperature using SuperBlock Pierce . Maturation phage libries were diluted in SuperBlock buffer and incubated 1 hour at room temperature. Phage libraries were then added to the blocked antigen plates incubated 2 hours at room temperature. After binding unbound and non specifically bound phage were removed from the antigen plates by washing with Wash Buffer PBS 05 Tween 20 . Bound phage were eluted by incubating the wells with 50 mM HCl 0.5 M KCl for 30 min. Phage were amplified using XL 1 Blue cells and M13 KO7 helper phage and grown for 36 hours at 30 C. in 2YT 50 g ml carbanecillin 50 ug ml kanamycin 10 g ml tetracycline. Amplified phage were then recovered using a modified PEG precipitation protocol Clackson Lowman 2004 . The titers of phage eluted from a target coated well were compared to titers of phage recovered from a non target coated well to assess enrichment. For selection rounds 2 5 a solution sorting protocol was implemented. Microtiter wells were coated with 10 g ml neutravidin in PBS overnight at 4 C. and then blocked for 1 hour using SuperBlock Pierce . Recovered phage libraries were suspended in SuperBlock and were mixed with 50 nM biotinylated Robo4 His for 1 hour. Phage bound to biotinylated Robo4 His were captured on neutravidin coated wells for 30 min and unbound phage were washed away with Wash Buffer. Phage were eluted using 50 mM HCl 500 mM KCl for 30 min neutralized and propagated in XL1 blue cells Stratagene in the presence of KO7 helper phage New England Biolabs . Subsequent rounds of sorting were performed similarly with the following exceptions in round 2 the final biotinylated Robo4 His concentration was 50 nM in round 3 the final biotinylated Robo4 His concentration was 25 nM in round 4 the final biotinylated Robo4 His concentration was 5 nM and in round 5 the final biotinylated Robo4 His concentration was 0.5 nM with 50 nM unbiotinylated Robo4 His added to the mixture for 1 hour prior to capture on neutravidin.

Several affinity matured clones were selected for binding to human Robo4 His and sequenced. The variable region sequences of the antibody clones derived by affinity maturation of clone YW71.22 are shown in light chain variable regions and heavy chain variable region .

Phage ELISA Phage competition binding assays were performed to determine the approximate binding affinity determined as phage IC of phage displayed Fabs for Robo4. The assays were performed as follows. Briefly purified phage supernatants from each clone were produced using a modified PEG precipitation protocol as described above. Purified phage supernatants were serially diluted in Phage Blocking buffer then incubated on plates coated with Robo4 His 1 g ml for 15 minutes. The plates were washed with Wash Buffer and were incubated for 30 minutes with horseradish peroxidase anti M13 antibody conjugate diluted 1 5000 in PBS buffer Amersham Pharmacia Biotech . The plates were washed developed with tetramethylbenzidine TMB substrate Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories and quenched with 0.1NHSO. Absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at 450 nm to determine the phage concentration giving about 50 of the signal at saturation. A fixed sub saturating concentration of phage was diluted in Phage Blocking buffer containing two fold serial dilutions of Robo4 His protein from 350 nM Robo4 to 5 nM Robo4. The mixtures were incubated for one hour with gentle shaking at room temperature transferred to plates coated with Robo4 His 1 g ml and the plates were incubated for 20 minutes. The plates were washed and treated as above. The binding affinities were estimated as ICvalues defined as the concentration of antigen that blocked 50 of the phage binding to the immobilized antigen . The ICresults for the seven clones are shown in Table 2.

Fab Production and Affinity Determination To express Fab protein for affinity measurements a stop codon was introduced between the heavy chain and g3 in the phage display vector. Clones were transformed into 34B8 cells and grown in AP5 media at 30 C Presta et al. 57 4593 4599 1997 . Cells were harvested by centrifugation suspended in 10 mM Tris 1 mM EDTA pH 8 and broken open using a microfluidizer. Fab was purified with Protein G affinity chromatography.

Affinity determinations were performed by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore 2000 system BIAcore Piscataway N.J. . Robo4 His was immobilized 1000 response units RU on a CM5 chip and varied concentrations of Fab 4 to 500 nM in PBST were injected. After each injection the chip was regenerated using 100 mM HCl.

The binding affinity of three phage derived anti Robo4 antibodies for soluble Robo4 extracellular domain ECD was determined by surface plasmon resonance measurement using a BIACORE 3000 system Biacore Inc. Piscataway N.J. . The antibodies tested included YW71.6 YW71.22 and YW79.8. Briefly carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips CM5 Biacore Inc. were activated with N ethyl N 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride EDC and N hydroxysuccinimide NHS according to the supplier s instructions. These activated chips were coated with anti Robo Fab by dilution to 5 ug ml with 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.8 before injection at a flow rate of 5 l minute to achieve approximately 500 response units RU of coupled antibody. Next 1M ethanolamine was injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements two fold serial dilutions of human or mouse ECD His tagged soluble antigen approximately 500 nM to approximately 7.8 nM were injected in PBS with 0.05 Tween 20 at 25 C. at a flow rate of 25 l min. Binding response was corrected by subtracting the RU from a blank flow cell. Association rates k and dissociation rates k were calculated using a simple one to one Langmuir binding model BIAevaluation Software version 3.2 . The equilibrium dissociation constant K was calculated as the ratio k k. The results of this experiment are shown in Table 3 below. Antibody YW71.22 cross reacts with human and mouse Robo4.

An affinity matured anti Robo4 antibody clone derived from YW71.22 were tested for binding to human Robo4 expressed endogenously in HUVEC cells and to murine Robo4 expressed endogenously in MS1 cells. A FACS analysis revealed that clones YW71.22.S1.16 and YW71.22.S1.21 bound to both human and murine Robo4 and that binding was comparable to the YW71.22 antibody .

Affinity matured YW71.22.S1.16 was used to generate a full length IgG1 and a Fab fragment both with a Cys substitution at position 118 of the heavy chain Fc region according to EU numbering. The Cys is used for site specific conjugation of the antibody to a label or drug of interest.

Binding affinities to human and mouse Robo4 were determined by in vitro binding measurements and by radiolabeled cell binding for full length YW71.22.S1.16 Mab full length YW71.22.S1.16 with engineered Cys thioMab and a Fab fragment of YW71.22.S1.16 with engineered Cys ThioFab .

The in vitro binding experiments were performed by SPR measurements on a ProteOn XPR36 instrument Bio Rad Laboratories Inc. at 25 C. Affinity matured Robo4 antibodies Mab ThioMab and ThioFab were immobilized at surface densities of 500 1000 RUs on an activated ProteOn GLC sensor chip Bio Rad Laboratories Inc. using standard amine coupling procedures as described by the manufacturer. Briefly antibodies were injected at a concentration of 10 g ml in 20 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5 and at a flow rate of 30 l min for 5 min. Unreacted groups were blocked by injecting 1 M ethanolamine. To perform binding assays samples were injected at a flow rate of 30 l min. For kinetics measurements serial dilutions of either purified human or mouse Robo4 His approximately 25 nM to 0.8 nM were injected in PBS with 0.01 Tween 20 and sensorgrams for association and dissociation phases were recorded. Blank surfaces were used for background corrections. There was no need to regenerate surfaces since the ProteOn protein interaction array system allows to run up to six binding experiments on an identical surface in parallel. Association rates k and dissociation rates k were calculated using a simple one to one Longmuir binding model ProteOn Manager Software V2.0 Bio Rad Laboratories Inc. and the equilibrium dissociation constant K was calculated as the ration k k. The results are summarized in Table 4 below.

HUVECs and MS1 cells which endogenously express Robo4 protein were used in radioligand cell binding experiments.

For the cell binding experiments anti Robo4 thioMab and thioFab antibodies were iodinated using the Iodogen method. Each radiolabeled antibody was purified from free I Na by gel filtration using a NAP 5 column the purified thioMab antibody had a specific activity of 6.96 Ci g and the purified thioFab antibody had a specific activity of 16.05 Ci g. 50 L competition mixtures containing a fixed concentration of iodinated antibody and decreasing concentrations of the unlabeled antibody were placed into 96 well plates. MS1 and HUVEC cells were cultured in growth media at 37 C. in 5 COand then were detached from tissue culture plates using a non enzymatic cell dissociating solution Sigma C5914 for subsequent binding studies. Cells were washed with binding buffer 50 50 DMEM F12 media containing 2 FBS 2 mM sodium azide and 50 mM HEPES pH 7.2 and were placed into the 96 well plates containing the competition mixtures at approximately 200 000 cells in 0.2 mL of binding buffer. The final concentration of the iodinated Mab antibody in each incubation with cells was 150 pM 70 000 cpms per 0.25 ml and the final concentration of the unlabeled antibody in the incubations with cells started at 400 nM and was serially diluted by 2 fold for 10 concentrations. The final concentration of the iodinated Fab antibody in each incubation with cells was 400 pM 150 000 cpms per 0.25 ml and the final concentration of the unlabeled antibody in the incubations with cells started at 1.0 uM and was serially diluted by 2 fold for 10 concentrations. Competition reactions were assayed in triplicate. The competition reactions were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Then they were transferred to a Millipore Multiscreen filter plate and washed three times with binding buffer to separate the free from bound iodinated antibody. The filters were counted on a Wallac Wizard 1470 gamma counter PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences Inc. Wellesley Mass. . The binding data was evaluated using NewLigand software Genentech which uses the fitting algorithm of Munson and Robard 107 220 39 1980 to determine the binding affinity of the antibody and the concentration of binding sites per well. The number of binding sites per cell was determined by dividing the total binding sites by the number of cells per well.

Anti Robo4 antibody YW71.22 significantly inhibits HUVEC tube elongation in a bead outgrowth assay. Both total number and length of the tubes are reduced as compared to the control antibody E25 . For example the number of tubes with a length of 300 m or more is reduced by 60 .

For the bead outgrowth assay dextran coated Cytodex 3 microcarrier beads Amersham were incubated with HUVECs 400 cells per bead in EGM 2 overnight at 37 C. and 5 CO. To induce clotting 0.5 ml cell coated beads in PBS with 2.5 g ml fibrinogen 200 beads ml was added into one well of a 24 well tissue culture plate containing 0.625 units thrombin and incubated for 5 min at room temperature and then for 20 min at 37 C. The clot was equilibrated in EGM 2 for 30 min at 37 C. The medium was then replaced with EGM 2 containing skin fibroblast cells Detroit 551 20 000 cells ml . Antibodies 50 g ml were added to each well and the assay was monitored for 8 days with change in medium every alternate day. Images of the beads were captured by an inverted microscope and concentric circles spaced at 100 200 and 300 m were drawn around the bead in each image. The number of vessels crossing each circle was counted 10 12 beads were used per condition for quantification Nakatsu et al. 66 102 112 2003 .

Anti Robo4 ADCs were produced by conjugating anti Robo4 antibodies to the drug linker moieties MCC DM1 SPDB DM4 and mPEO DM1. Prior to conjugation the antibodies were partially reduced with TCEP using standard methods in accordance with the methodology described in WO 2004 010957. The partially reduced antibodies were conjugated to the above drug linker moieties using standard methods in accordance with the methodology described in Doronina et al. 21 778 784 2003 and U.S. Patent Application No. 2005 0238649. Briefly the partially reduced antibodies were combined with the drug linker moieties to allow conjugation of the moieties to cysteine residues including without limitation cysteine engineered residues of thioMAbs as disclosed herein . The conjugation reactions were quenched and the ADCs were purified. The drug load average number of drug moieties per antibody for each ADC was determined by HPLC. Additional anti Robo4 ADCs are made using e.g. drug linker moieties including spp DM1 smcc DM1 MC vc PAB MMAE MC vc PAB MMAF MC MMAE and MC MMAF see e.g. WO 2004 010957 and WO2006 034488 each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety .

Naked anti Robo4 antibody Tumor growth was not inhibited by naked anti Robo4 antibody YW71.22 antibody not conjugated to a cytotoxic agent or other agent in mouse xenograft models of human non small cell lung carcinoma SK MES 1. For this study each HRLN female nude mouse received a 1 mmtumor fragment s.c. implant in the flank. Tumor growth was monitored twice weekly by caliper measurements. When tumors reached an average size of 80 120 mm mice were sorted to give nearly identical group mean tumor sizes and treatment was started Day 1 . Animals were dosed twice weekly i.p. with 10 mg kg anti Robo4 and or 5 mg kg anti VEGF or control antibody for 5 weeks. All treatments were body weight adjusted at 0.2 mg 20 g. The results are shown in . In addition no reduction of tumor growth in Fo5 mouse model with MDA MB 231 breast cancer xenograft was observed.

An anti Robo4 antibody comprising an Fc region having enhanced ADCC activity may be used to inhibit tumor growth. The ADCC enhanced anti Robo4 antibody may be a naked antibody or an antibody drug conjugate as disclosed herein. ADCC enhancement is achieved for example by enhancing IgG1 FcgammaRIII interactions which are dependent on the carbohydrate moieties linked to the antibody Fc region. Non limiting exemplary methods for ADCC enhancement include reducing antibody fucosylation by expressing anti Robo4 in a host cell overexpressing GnTIII which encodes N acetylglucosaminyltransferase Narishimhan 257 10235 10242 1982 and Umana et al. 17 176 180 1999 a host cell underexpressing or lacking expression of FUT8 which encodes alpha 1 6 fucosyltransferase Shinkawa et al. 278 3466 3473 2003 or a host cell lacking or underexpressing UDP N acetylglucosamine 2 epinerase such as Lec3 CHO cells Hong and Stanley 278 53045 53054 2003 . In addition ADCC is enhanced by amino acid changes in the Fc region see for example WO2000042072 and WO2004029207 . Thus anti Robo4 antibodies of the invention are useful as cytotoxic agents include anti Robo4 antibodies exhibiting enhanced ADCC function relative to an anti Robo4 antibody exhibiting wild type Fc ADCC activity.

Anti Robo4 antibody drug conjugate Anti Robo4 ADC To test the efficacy of toxin conjugated anti Robo4 ADCs for the ability to reduce tumor volume in vivo the following protocol is employed.

SCID mice are each inoculated subcutaneously in the flank with cells of a human cancer cell line. The human cancer cell lines include as non limiting examples SK MES 1 human non small lung cancer cells and MDA MB 231 breast cancer cells. When the tumors reach a mean tumor volume of between approximately 80 200 mm the mice are divided into groups and treated by intravenous injection with toxin conjugated antibody or unconjugated antibody.

SCID mice are injected with human tumor cells subcutaneously in a volume of 0.2 ml 20 g mouse body weight in the flank. Cells are suspended in HBSS. When the mean tumor size reaches approximately 80 200 mm mice are randomly grouped into groups and given a single or multiple I.V. treatments via the tail vein of either a anti Robo4 ADC conjugated to maytansine or a control antibody.

Mean tumor volume is monitored in each treatment group for approximately 30 days post antibody injection. Tumor may be detected by for example fluorescence detection of remaining luciferase where the tumor cells are engineered to express luciferase. Efficacy of the toxin conjugated anti CD22 antibodies is determined by comparison to control and unconjugated antibodies.

The same experiment is performed using anti Robo4 ADC wherein the drug conjugated to the antibody is an auristatin.

The same experiment is repeated using an anti Robo4 ADC comprising an Fc region having enhanced ADCC activity.

sDOTA labeled anti Robo4 antibodies are prepared as follows. The DOTA NHS ester was dissolved in dimethylacetamide DMA Fluka Chemika Switzerland and prepared to concentrations of 60 100 mg mL. Typical procedures involved buffer exchanging the MAb into PBS with 2 mM EDTA at pH 7.2. Reactions were performed at a ratio of 1 molecule MAb to 4 DOTA molecules 1 4 and carried out at 25 C. while gently stirring on a Thermomixer plate Eppendorf Westbury N.Y. . The DOTA labeled anti Robo4 antibody is useful as a detectable marker in vitro or in vivo when associated with as non limiting examples yttrium Y In Lu and the like. The mAb conjugates are labeled with for example In by incubating the conjugate with InClin 0.25 M ammonium acetate for 45 min at 43 C. EDTA is added to a final concentration of 1 mM and the mixture is incubated at 37 C. for 15 minutes. Labeling with Y for example is performed using a one hour incubation at 43 C. after which DTPA is added to a final concentration of 1 mM and the mixture is incubated for an additional 15 min at 37 C. The radiometal labeled mAb conjugates are purified by size exclusion HPLC using a TosoHaas TSKgel G2000 SW column and a mobile phase of normal saline.

Robo4 does not block endothelial cell EC migration. Robo4 Fc and Robo4 His were contacted with vascular ECs using a HUVEC migration assay and in the presence or absence of VEGF. shows the results of the assay. Robo4 Fc or Robo4 His alone did not induce EC migration and VEGF induced EC migration was not enhanced by Robo4.

Robo4 does not bind to Slit2. Robo4 Fc contacted with Slit2 did not show binding by Biocore analysis whereas Robo1 and Slit 2 did show binding in the same assay . Slit2 His histidine tagged full length Slit2 was immobilized on a CM5 Biacore chip at high density. A 5 l aliquot of each analyte Robo4 Fc or Robo1 Fc fusion proteins was injected and allowed to interact with the immobilized ligand in buffer HEPES EDTA NaCl pH7.5 .

Robo4 interacts in vitro with UNC5B a cell surface receptor involved in vascular guidance. It has been shown that netrin binding to members of the uncoordinated 5 UNC5 family of receptors UNC5A B C and D results in neural axon repression Klagsbrun M. and Eichmann A. Cytokine Growth Factor Reviews 16 4 5 535 548 2005 . Netrin UNC5B interaction has been implicated in angiogenesis Klagsbrun M. and Eichmann A. supra 2005 and Lu X. et al. Nature 432 179 186 2004 . The interaction of Robo4 with UNC5B in vitro was determined by SPR binding measurements in which UNC5B Fc fusion protein extracellular domain of UNC5B fused to an Fc region was immobilized on a chip and soluble Robo4 Fc or Robo4 His was allowed to interact with it at different concentrations. SPR measurements were performed as described in Example 7 and the interaction results are shown in .

Cells were permeabilized and stained as above. The results are shown in .

Endothelial cell migration was not blocked by anti Robo4 antibody in an in vitro assay using human umbilical vascular endothelial cells HUVEC cellular migration assay. HUVECs endogenously express human Robo4. The assay was performed as follows. HUVECs were pre incubated for 2 hours with VEGF. Cellular migration was allowed to continue for 16 hours in the presence of anti Robo4 antibody YW71.22 anti VEGF antibody or Robo4 Fc or Robo4 His. Neither anti Robo4 nor the soluble Robo4 extracellular domain fusion proteins Robo4 Fc and Robo4 His blocked EC migration under these conditions .

Anti Robo4 antibody associates with vasculature in vivo. Fifty micrograms of anti Robo4 antibody 71.22 or control antibody anti HER2 were injected via tail vein and allowed to circulate for 10 minutes. One hundred micrograms of FITC Lycopersicum esculentum was injected and allowed to circulate for 5 minutes. Mice were perfused with 1 PFA in PBS tissues were collected into 30 sucrose and frozen in OCT. Antibodies were detected with Cy3 goat anti human IgG. shows that the location of FITC Lycopersicum esculentum staining in vasculature overlaps with the location of anti Robo4 Cy3 staining unlike the control antibody which migrated into surrounding tissue.
