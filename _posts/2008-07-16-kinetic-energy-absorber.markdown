This application claims the benefit under 35 USC 119 e of U.S. provisional patent application No. 60 950 125 filed Jul. 17 2007 which application is hereby incorporated by reference.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to kinetic energy absorbers and in particular to kinetic energy absorbers for projectiles.

Non lethal and non explosive projectiles are used with increasing frequency to facilitate a variety of emerging needs. These projectiles are often required to function after initial impact. Therefore cargo and other internal components must not be damaged during the projectile s impact.

In the past impact devices have been designed with metallic or polymer foams to provide energy absorption. The effectiveness and versatility of these types of materials are limited because foams are not easily tailored to achieve a specific response. Additionally foam stiffness increases as compression occurs and requires large envelopes to effectively mitigate the g levels produced during impact. Large sized foam sections are often difficult or impractical for use on gun launched projectiles.

One aspect of the invention is a kinetic energy absorbing apparatus comprising a body having a generally ogival exterior surface and at least one kinetic energy absorbing structure KEAS extending generally rearwardly from substantially an interior surface of the body. A longitudinal axis of the body and a longitudinal axis of the at least one KEAS may be substantially parallel. The at least one KEAS may comprise a plurality of KEAS. The longitudinal axis of the body and longitudinal axes of the KEAS may be substantially coincident. The KEAS may be substantially evenly spaced radially. Aft termini of the KEAS may lie in substantially a same transverse plane or in more than one transverse plane.

The KEAS may comprise generally hollow structures such as for example tubes hollow polyhedrons hollow conical structures hollow prisms or combinations of these.

Another aspect of the invention is a projectile comprising an ogival kinetic energy absorbing apparatus a projectile body and a spacer. The spacer may be disposed between the projectile body and a KEAS. The spacer may include at least one forwardly extending member that meshes with a KEAS.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The invention includes a kinetic energy absorber that mitigates the induced g forces on a projectile as well as the internal components of a projectile. Reducing induced g forces on internal components increases their survivability. The invention may be designed to be sacrificial. That is the structure may fail catastrophically while leaving the remaining projectile and its components intact.

The present invention may comprise the nose of a projectile. The nose is mounted to the body of the projectile at the forward most point. Mounting methods may include threading machine screws or adhesives depending on projectile size and function. Compared to a foam energy absorber the present invention provides a more constant stiffness throughout the impact.

In general a kinetic energy absorber structure KEAS may be a hollow structure that extends rearwardly from an interior surface of an ogive. The longitudinal axis of the KEA may be parallel to the longitudinal axis of the ogive. The diameter size number wall thickness radial spacing and rearward extent of the KEAS may vary. The KEAS are designed to crush upon impact and mitigate g loading on a projectile.

As impact begins the KEAS begin to buckle successively slowing the velocity of the projectile. As buckling continues the KEAS will deform significantly and may rupture thus continuing to absorb the projectile s kinetic energy. Material selection for the KEAS may be varied to provide a particular response or buckling mode allowing the invention to be used in a variety of applications.

The KEAS may be used for commercial applications that require a single use kinetic energy absorber. Additionally the KEAS may be used in a modular fashion to create large kinetic energy absorbing structures. The illustrated embodiments depict several exemplary variations.

As best seen in nose may include KEAS in the form of hollow cylinders or tubes . Tubes may extend substantially from the interior of the ogival portion rearwardly to the transverse plane A A . In each of tubes is shown extending to transverse plane A A. However one of more of the tubes may extend rearwardly further than plane A A or may terminate forward of plane A A. In forward means to the right and rearward means to the left.

Three tubes are shown in but there may be more or fewer than three tubes. Tubes may be substantially concentric that is the longitudinal axes of the tubes and the longitudinal axis of the nose may be substantially coincident with line B B. Tubes may be evenly radially spaced or unevenly radially spaced. The thickness of tubes may be the same or may be different. Tubes may comprise the same or different materials and may be integral with ogival portion or not integral with ogival portion .

The KEAS shown in are generally tubular however they may also be for example conic structures polyhedrons comprising three or more sides or combinations of these structures. KEAS may be concentric with axis B B of nose

A Finite Element Analysis FEA was conducted to determine the dynamic response of the invention and of conventional foam. show the predicted FEA results for induced G loading and reflected impact velocity for the embodiment shown in and for conventional foam. The results show the invention may achieve a reduction in induced G loading of about 50 compared to conventional foam. Additionally the reduction in reflected velocity of about 60 shows that the invention absorbs more kinetic energy than conventional foam.

A prototype of the embodiment of was built and tested. On board telemetry was used to collect acceleration data. Compared to conventional foam the invention showed about a 40 reduction in peak G load from 40 000 Gs to 25 000 Gs.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
