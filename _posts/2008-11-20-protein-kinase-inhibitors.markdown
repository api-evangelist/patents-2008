This invention pertains to compounds that inhibit protein kinases compositions containing the compounds and methods of treating diseases using the compounds.

Numerous human diseases are characterized by increased and uncontrolled cell growth. This biology is driven in many cases by increased growth factor signaling. In addition these pathologies often require an expanding blood supply and new vessel growth. Protein kinases are key components of both cell proliferation and endothelial cell expansion. Kinases are thus important targets for therapeutic intervention in pathologies characterized by uncontrolled cell growth.

One embodiment of this invention therefore pertains to compounds that inhibit protein kinases and have Formula I

Compounds having asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms with equal amounts of R and S configurations are racemic at those atoms. Atoms having excess of one configuration over the other are assigned the configuration in excess preferably an excess of about 85 90 more preferably an excess of about 95 99 and still more preferably an excess greater than about 99 . Accordingly this invention is meant to embrace racemic mixtures and relative and absolute diastereoisomers of the compounds thereof.

Compounds of this invention may also contain carbon carbon double bonds or carbon nitrogen double bonds in the Z or E configuration in which the term Z represents the larger two substituents on the same side of a carbon carbon or carbon nitrogen double bond and the term E represents the larger two substituents on opposite sides of a carbon carbon or carbon nitrogen double bond.

Compounds of this invention containing NH C O OH OH or SH moieties may have attached thereto prodrug forming moieties. The prodrug forming moieties are removed by metabolic processes and release the compounds having the freed NH C O OH OH or SH in vivo. Prodrugs are useful for adjusting such pharmacokinetic properties of the compounds as solubility and or hydrophobicity absorption in the gastrointestinal tract bioavailability tissue penetration and rate of clearance.

Metabolites of compounds having Formula I produced by in vitro or in vivo metabolic processes may also have utility for treating diseases associated with overexpression or unregulation of a kinase.

Certain precursor compounds which may be metabolized in vitro or in vivo to form compounds having Formula I may also have utility for treating diseases associated with overexpression or unregulation of a kinase.

Compounds having Formula I may exist as acid addition salts basic addition salts or zwitterions. Salts of compounds having Formula I are prepared during their isolation or following their purification. Acid addition salts are those derived from the reaction of a compound having Formula I with acid. Accordingly salts including the acetate adipate alginate bicarbonate citrate aspartate benzoate benzenesulfonate besylate bisulfate butyrate camphorate camphorsulfonate digluconate formate fumarate glycerophosphate glutamate hemisulfate heptanoate hexanoate hydrochloride hydrobromide hydroiodide lactobionate lactate maleate mesitylenesulfonate methanesulfonate naphthylenesulfonate nicotinate oxalate pamoate pectinate persulfate phosphate picrate propionate succinate tartrate thiocyanate trichloroacetic trifluoroacetic para toluenesulfonate and undecanoate salts of the compounds having Formula I are meant to be embraced by this invention. Basic addition salts of compounds are those derived from the reaction of the compounds having Formula I with the bicarbonate carbonate hydroxide or phosphate of cations such as lithium sodium potassium calcium and magnesium.

Compounds having Formula I may be administered for example bucally ophthalmically orally osmotically parenterally intramuscularly intraperintoneally intrasternally intravenously subcutaneously rectally topically transdermally vaginally and intraarterially as well as by intraarticular injection infusion and placement in the body such as for example the vasculature.

Therapeutically effective amounts of a compound having Formula I depend on recipient of treatment disease treated and severity thereof composition comprising it time of administration route of administration duration of treatment potency rate of clearance and whether or not another drug is co administered. The amount of a compound having Formula I used to make a composition to be administered daily to a mammal in a single dose or in divided doses is from about 0.001 to about 200 mg kg body weight. Single dose compositions contain these amounts or a combination of submultiples thereof.

Compounds having Formula I may be administered with or without an excipient. Excipients include but are not limited to encapsulators and additives such as absorption accelerators antioxidants binders buffers coating agents coloring agents diluents disintegrating agents emulsifiers extenders fillers flavoring agents humectants lubricants perfumes preservatives propellants releasing agents sterilizing agents sweeteners solubilizers wetting agents mixtures thereof and the like.

To determine the binding of compounds having Formula I to a representative protein kinase protein tyrosine kinase the following assay was used 

EGFR L858R kinase activity was assayed by a homogenous time resolved fluorescence HTRF in vitro kinase assay Mathis G. . J Biomol Screen 1999. 4 6 p. 309 314 . Specifically 10 L C terminal GST tagged recombinant human EGFR amino acids 696 end containing the mutation L858R expressed by baculovirus in Sf21 cells Millipore was mixed with 10 ul inhibitor various concentrations 2 final DMSO and 10 ul of ATP 50 M final concentration in reaction buffer 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5 10 mM MgCl 2 mM MnCl 0.1 BSA and 1 mM DTT 40 L final volume . The reaction was initiated by addition of 10 ul of biotinylated peptide substrate Biotin Ahx AEEEYFFLFA 0.5 M final concentration in a black 384 well plate Packard . After 60 minutes incubation at room temperature the reaction was quenched by addition 60 L stop revelation buffer to give 30 mM EDTA 1 g ml streptavidin APC Prozyme 50 ng ml anti phosphotyrosine mAb PT66 K Europium Cryptate 30 mM HEPES pH 7.5 120 mM KF 0.005 Tween 20 0.05 BSA . The quenched reaction was allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 hour and then read in a time resolved fluorescence detector Envision Perkin Elmer at 615 nm and 665 nm simultaneously.
