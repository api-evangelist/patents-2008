This is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 09 963 742 filed Sep. 27 2001 which is a U.S. Non Provisional Patent Application related to U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60 235 548 filed Sep. 27 2000 both of common assignee the contents of both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

The present invention is related generally to online auctions and more particularly to buyer side bidding tools.

One of the first widely popular website types facilitated by widespread user access to the Internet is the online auction site. Online auctions initially in the business to consumer B2C space such as e.g. EBAY and Yahoo Auctions enable many consumer clients with a computer and an Internet Service provider ISP account to participate as a buyer i.e. bidder user or member or seller or biddee in an auction. With the advent of business to business B2B electronic commerce auction sites such as e.g. Freemarkets business buyers in a procurement department can similarly bid on e.g. supplies parts and vendor equipment.

Conventionally online auctions can occur 24 hours per day seven days per week. Unfortunately a bidder is not able to monitor the status of an auction continually. It is desirable that tools to automate the bidding process be made available to bidders. Unfortunately auction sites also continually create countermeasures to make it difficult to automate bidding.

Conventional auctions include bidding rules and bidding parameters. Unfortunately bidding rules and parameters can change from time to time.

Conventionally tools designed to automate the bidding process for a bidder i.e. on the buy side have been standalone workstation software based and lack various desirable features. Unfortunately as bidding rules and parameters change and counter measures are added the standalone software based tools no longer work. Thus it is desirable that an improved tool be provided that overcomes the shortcomings of conventional solutions.

The present invention is directed to a system method and computer program product that automates many of the processes of the buyer side of a dynamic pricing or auction pricing transaction executed on the Internet.

If no decision step determines if supporting page links is selected. If yes flow proceeds to page links . If no service promotions are presented in step . Next banner ads are presented in step . The process ends at step .

Specifically flow diagram depicts a flow proceeding from cascade bid . In step the cascaded bid list is prepared. Next in step it is verified that the cascaded closes are staggered in time. Then cascaded bid parameters are checked to determine in step whether a cascade is to be deleted. If a cascade is deleted the cascaded mode is removed along with items from the portfolio in step . Then if a cascade is not deleted and after cascaded mode and portfolio items are removed it is verified that the parameters satisfy cascade boundary conditions in step . Then the AP statistical win assessment algorithm is applied to the cascade item bid priority in step . Violations and log exceptions are computed next in step . The exception conditions and boundary violations are displayed in step and are stored in step . Decision step determines whether there are exception or violations. If yes flow proceeds back to checking cascaded bid parameters for deletion in step . If no then the active bids are loaded or reloaded with cascade mode and bid priority in step and are stored as portfolio . Finally flow proceeds to bid portfolio .

Specifically flow diagram depicts meta search where a keyword search is entered in step . Then auction sites to be searched are selected in step . After the search a found set is generated in step . The hypertext link enabled found set or auction items resulting from the search are displayed in step . The found set can be used to select an item from the list to link to the auction s site in step . Selecting an item in step leads to the target auction site in step . Alternatively the hypertext link enabled list of found items can be used to select auction items to add to a portfolio in step . Decision step determines whether a single auction item is selected. If no decision step determines if a cascade bid is selected. If a cascade bid is selected flow proceeds to cascade bid . If not the multiple auction items are loaded into a bid portfolio in step . If a single auction item is selected in step then the bid portfolio is loaded in step . Then flow proceeds to bid portfolio .

Specifically flow diagram depicts the meta register . Using the inputs of member selections for auction sites to register and the user s meta registration information site user agreements are displayed in step . Then the user s acceptance of the site user agreements is recorded in step . The user is next registered on the auction site in step . Any exception conditions are handled in step . If there are more auction sites to register in step the flow repeats starting from step . If there are no more auction sites to register the auction site registration information is stored in step .

Specifically flow diagram depicts getting a session cookie for one or more my bid portfolios in step . Then the member s bid portfolio is displayed in step . Next an item is selected on which to enter or edit a programmed bid in step . If individual mode is selected in step or if neither individual mode nor a cascaded bid mode item in step is selected bid parameters are retrieved in step . If individual mode is not selected but there is a cascaded bid mode item selected then bid parameters for all items in the cascade are retrieved in step . Step is followed by step where the integrity of the cascaded item set is verified. Then steps and both proceed to step where the maximum bid is entered or edited. Next the bid countdown is entered or edited in step . Bid parameters are verified in step . If the bid items fail verification in step the exception list is displayed in step and the exception conditions are stored in step . If the items are verified the active bids are loaded or reloaded in step . The portfolio is stored in step and is redisplayed in step where the process repeats.

Specifically flow diagram shows that information from stored member account is displayed in step . Then the personal profile is created read updated or deleted in step . The resulting modifications are again stored in member account . A subscription is then modified or entered in step and the subscription is also stored in member account . The current transaction history along with transaction history stored in are then displayed in step . Next if home is selected in step flow proceeds to agent proxy . Otherwise if support is selected in step flow proceeds to customer support . If support is not selected the account information is redisplayed at step and the process repeats from there.

Specifically flow diagram shows that for any bid engine the database is scanned for an active bid in step using stored portfolio . Then the list of bids to execute is created or updated in step . If the bid is not within the time to auction close TAC window in step the list of bids to execute is updated in step . Otherwise the auction site characterization is obtained in step . Next the item s current price is obtained in step . The bid is calculated then in step . If the proposed bid is less than the maximum bid in step then a bid is entered in step using the site characterization. The bid confirmation is logged in step . The bid and the auction site are added to the fast scan list in step and flow proceeds to fast scan . If the proposed bid exceeds the maximum bid in step the item is logged as a lost bid in step . The item is then set to inactive in the bid portfolio in step and flow proceeds to agent proxy . Alternatively flow from bid engine can proceed to step .

Specifically flow diagram shows flows proceeding to a fast scan or where first a fast scan item is obtained in step . Next in step fast scan site characterization is obtained and auction site characterization is stored in step . Next site performance parameters are calibrated in step . Then in step the item s current price and bidder is obtained. If the current price is from AP users proxied bid at decision step and if the bid is not closed at step flow proceeds to fast scan . If the bid is closed at step then the bid history and win status are logged at step and stored in a transaction history . If the current price is not from AP users proxied bid in step and if the bid is closed at step then the bid history and loss status are logged at step and stored in a transaction history . After storing the transaction history decision step determines if the bid was in a cascade. If yes the remaining cascade items are deleted in step . If not then flow proceeds to bid engine .

If the bid is not closed at step a bid is then calculated in step . If the proposed bid is less than the maximum bid in step the bid agent is accessed in step and flow proceeds to bid agent . If the proposed bid is higher than the maximum bid flow proceeds to bid engine .

Specifically flow diagram shows a bid agent state machine initialized at step from a flow proceeding from bid agent . The initialization can include information from stored auction site characterization . If the state sequence is completed at step the bid is then confirmed in step . If the bid is then accepted in step flow proceeds to fast scan . If the state sequence is at state s a bid page form is requested based on site characterization at step . The state sequence then proceeds to the next state. If the state sequence is at state s the buyer bidder authentication is entered at step . The state sequence then proceeds to the next state. In state s the bidder s bid is entered at step . The state sequence is then complete.

If the bid is not accepted at step counter measures are detected in step . If a delay close counter measures is detected at step the item close is adjusted to the new time in step . If delay counter measures are not detected but block IP counter measures are detected in step the bid is distributed to a proxied peer server in step . After these or other counter measures are detected the counter measures are logged in step . Next the item is moved to a list of bids to execute in step . Flow then proceeds to proxied bid engine .

From proxied bid engine an available server is selected from the least used algorithm in step . The peer to peer distributed server list is stored at step . The list is also updated with an upload of available server statistics in step . Next the bid object is sent to the server at step . In step an acknowledgement is requested from the peer to peer server. If the bid object is received and activated at step flow proceeds to bid engine . If not the server is pushed to the bottom of the queue in step . The process repeats starting at step .

From a current bid monitor the active bids in the meta portfolio are iterated through starting at step . Next the current item price is compared to the bidder s maximum price in step . If the current price is greater than the bidder s maximum at step an email is sent to the bidder alerting him that his maximum has been exceeded in step . If the current price is lower than the bidder s maximum then if all active bids have been scanned in step flow proceeds to agent proxy . Other wise another iteration begins at step .
