title: Explosive water jet with precursor bubble
abstract: A water jet assembly and method of use is provided comprising a tank with cutting fluid, fuel and oxidizer lines, and a tank discharge lines. In operation, the tank is filled with oxidizer; the oxidizer line is closed and cutting fluid is supplied compressing the oxidizer. When the fluid reaches a level, the fluid line is closed and fuel is injected. A spark generator ignites the fuel/oxidizer mixture thereby raising the tank pressure. As the pressure rises, a low pressure valve simultaneously closes at a prescribed level. The vent line and a discharge to a nozzle are opened thereby, forming a gas bubble. When the bubble reaches a desired size and pressure drops below a level, the vent closes, allowing combustion expansion to force fluid through the nozzle to form a cutting jet.

This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60 963 201 filed on Jul. 20 2007 and entitled Explosive Water Jet with Precursor Bubble by the inventor Thomas J. Gieseke.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.

The present invention relates to an assembly and a method of use for producing a high velocity water jet in a deep water environment where depth pressure would typically inhibit the formation of a supercavitation bubble.

High velocity jets are commonly used in industrial systems for cutting operations. For example pressures of 380 Mpa 50 000 pounds per square inch generated with specialized hydraulic pumps are used to produce small diameter fluid jets with velocities approaching 800 meters per second. These systems are designed for precision and continuous cutting. As such diameters of the fluid jets are typically very small no greater than one millimeter .

Jet pulses of this size can only penetrate a short distance typically one meter in the water. Power consumption for significantly larger jets becomes prohibitive if sustained operation is required.

The water jet system described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 868 790 Gieseke et al. is designed to overcome the jet formation inhibiting effects of water as a surrounding medium. The system and method of use of the cited reference utilizes a supercavity formed by an impulsively created jet as a jet front propagates through the medium. At a significant depth greater than one hundred meters and under a high ambient pressure at the depth the cavitation bubble that would otherwise form at the jet front is suppressed. For use in deep water drilling applications a need therefore exists for forming the cavitation bubble that overcomes the jet formation inhibiting effects of water as a surrounding medium.

Accordingly it is a general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide an assembly and method of use for drilling in deep water applications.

It is a further object of the present invention to provide an assembly and method of use for creating a gas bubble at the water jet discharge nozzle through which high velocity water is expelled as a cutting system that overcomes the jet formation inhibiting effects of water as a surrounding medium.

To attain the objects described above the present invention features an assembly and method of use for producing a pulsed jet. The assembly generally comprises a tank feed lines for water an oxidizer line a fuel line a spark generator discharge lines and control valves.

In operation the tank is purged using a gaseous oxidizer. Any residual combustion gas and liquid is forced out of the tank through discharge valves and a nozzle. The discharge valves are then closed and the tank is filled with oxidizer. The oxidizer control valve is then closed and water or other cutting fluid is injected into the tank thereby compressing the oxidizer within the tank.

When the cutting fluid attains a desired level in the tank the control valve is closed and fuel is injected into the compressed oxidizer trapped above the cutting fluid. A spark generator ignites the fuel air mixture thereby raising the pressure in the tank. As the pressure rises in the tank a low pressure control valve closes at a prescribed level. Simultaneously a gas vent line is opened as is a high pressure discharge valve. Combustion gas is then free to discharge into the water medium through the discharge nozzle thereby forming a gas bubble at the nozzle exit.

When the gas bubble reaches a desired size and the pressure in the tank drops below a desired level the gas vent line is closed and the high pressure discharge valve opens to allow expansion of the combination gas. The gas forces the cutting fluid through the discharge nozzle.

The discharged cutting fluid forms a cutting jet. The presence of the gas bubble allows the jet to retain coherence as the water jet traverses the space between the nozzle and a cutting surface. After the cutting fluid has been expended the remaining gas discharges through the nozzle completing the cutting cycle.

Generally the proposed water jet assembly and method of use overcomes difficulties with traditionally used steady cutting jets and the pulsed difficulties of the jet described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 868 790 incorporated herein by reference by venting combustion gases immediately prior to the water jet in order to eliminate water resistance.

In operation the tank is purged by the oxidizer line using a gaseous oxidizer such as air. As shown in any residual combustion gas and liquid is forced out of the tank in direction A through the discharge valves and a nozzle by using the oxidizer supplied by the oxidizer line See Table 1 for valve sequencing .

The control valves are then closed and the tank is filled with oxidizer See . The control valve is then closed and water by the water feed line or other cutting fluid is supplied in direction B into the tank by the opening of control valve thereby compressing the oxidizer within the tank See .

When the cutting fluid attains a desired level in the tank Direction C the control valve is closed and the control valve in the fuel line is opened and fuel is injected in Direction D to the compressed oxidizer trapped above the cutting fluid See .

The spark generator ignites the fuel oxidizer mixture for an explosive ignition thereby raising the pressure in the tank See . As the pressure rises in the tank the control valve closes at a prescribed level approximately 50 pounds per square inch over ambient pressure . Simultaneously the control valve of the gas vent line is opened as is the high pressure discharge control valve . Combustion gas is then free to discharge into the water medium through the discharge nozzle forming a gas bubble at the nozzle exit See .

When the gas bubble reaches a desired size and the pressure in the tank drops below a desired level the control valve closes and the control valve remains open to allow expansion of the combination gas See . The expanding gas forces the cutting fluid out of the tank in Direction E through the discharge nozzle .

The discharged cutting fluid forms a cutting jet . The presence of the gas bubble allows the cutting jet to retain coherence as the water of the cutting jet traverses a space between the nozzle and a cutting surface. After the cutting fluid has been expended the remaining combustion gas discharges through the nozzle completing the cycle See . To produce a pulsed cutting jet the cycle is repeated in succession.

Pressures realized in the tank over time during the cycle are shown in . The labeled phases of operation are 1 purging 2 oxidizer injection 3 compression 4 fuel injection 5 combustion 6 gas venting 7 cutting jet formation and 8 tank venting.

The valves used in the proposed system may be controlled via servo systems or through the use of pressure activation. Table 1 matches the valve cycle phase and operation state x denotes a closed state and o denotes an open state .
