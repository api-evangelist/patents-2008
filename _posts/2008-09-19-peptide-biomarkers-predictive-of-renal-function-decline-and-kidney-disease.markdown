The presently disclosed subject matter claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60 974 002 filed Sep. 20 2007 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 050 521 filed May 5 2008 the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

This presently disclosed subject matter was made with U.S. Government support under Grant Nos. R01 DK41526 and RO1 DK067638 02 both awarded by National Institutes of Health. Thus the U.S. Government has certain rights in the presently disclosed subject matter.

The presently disclosed subject matter relates to methods for diagnosing a kidney disease in a subject. In particular the presently disclosed subject matter relates to methods for diagnosing a kidney disease in a subject by determining an amount of one or more peptide biomarkers in a biological samples from the subject.

Diabetic nephropathy DN is a kidney disease that is a severe late complication of type 1 diabetes T1D which frequently requires renal replacement therapy. The primary diagnostic test to identify patients with T1D at risk for progressive renal dysfunction leading to DN has been microalbuminuria MA 1 2 . However the predictive value of MA is now questioned First only a fifth of patients with MA will progress to proteinuria 3 second a large proportion of patients with MA can revert to normoalbuminuria 4 6 and third many patients at the onset of MA have begun to experience early renal function decline ERFD 7 8 . These findings have called into question the previous paradigm of DN in T1D in which the finding of MA conveyed a high risk of progressive renal dysfunction and support a new model in which a subset of those with MA develop progressive ERFD. This change in our understanding of diabetic renal disease also is indicative of our incomplete understanding of the mechanisms of ERFD a process that takes place while measured renal function is still in the normal or even elevated range. These findings emphasize the need for the development of biomarkers to diagnose kidney disease such as ERFD in those with MA.

Accordingly there is an unmet need for new biomarkers and methods of using same for diagnosing kidney disease.

Earlier identification and treatment of kidney disease can result in reducing or even preventing kidney disease progression and improving disease treatment prognosis. Presently diagnosis of kidney disease usually occurs after significant damage has already resulted. Higher degrees of previous kidney damage at diagnosis limit the efficacy of kidney function preservation therapies and result in higher disease progression rates. Thus a biomarker of kidney damage that is able to indicate the presence of both early damage and identify patients at an increased risk of progressive disease would favorably impact kidney disease diagnosis and treatment. Desirably the biomarker would indicate renal damage prior to the current indicators of kidney dysfunction be available non invasively and be easily interpretable.

Current markers of kidney disease and kidney disease progression include serum creatinine and urinary protein concentration including microalbuminuria MA . The slope of the decrease in glomerular filtration rate GFR has been demonstrated to predict the timing of end stage renal disease ESRD and the level of proteinuria has been shown to correlate with kidney disease progression rates. These biomarkers of kidney disease provide some utility however their ability to recognize early kidney disease is limited. Recent studies have demonstrated that MA does not correlate well with the development of kidney disease in more than 30 of patients with Type I diabetes T1DM . Further studies also demonstrate that 20 30 of patients with Type 2 diabetes T2DM progress to chronic kidney disease in the absence of MA. In addition serum creatinine concentration is recognized as an unreliable measure of kidney function because it is dependent on age gender race muscle mass weight and various medications. Correct interpretation of kidney function based on serum creatinine requires complex formulas that are not routinely employed by practicing healthcare providers.

Thus there is presently an unmet need for diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of early and or progressive kidney disease that become positive prior to or at the earliest point that kidney damage begins to occur. This subclinical kidney damage recognition would occur prior to or in the absence of a rise in serum creatinine the development of urinary creatinine or MA. A benefit that identification of subclinical kidney damage would confer is the ability to initiate early interventions to promote kidney function preservation. The presently disclosed subject matter is based in part on the discovery that proteomic profiling can be used to identify biomarkers in biological samples such as for example urine blood or plasma that are associated with development of kidney disease in some instances before any clinically identifiable alteration in renal function e.g. glomerular filtration rate serum creatinine concentration or urine albumin excretion e.g. MA occurs.

In some embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter a method for diagnosing a kidney disease or the risk for development thereof in a subject is provided. In some embodiments the method comprises obtaining a biological sample from the subject and determining an amount including a qualitative determination of the presence or absence of at least one peptide biomarker associated with kidney disease such as for example one or more peptides set forth in Table 1 or Table 2 e.g. SEQ ID NOs 1 59 . The method can further comprise comparing the amount of the at least one peptide in the sample with a control level. If the amount determined from the sample differs from e.g. is greater than or less than the control level the subject can be diagnosed as having or being at an increased risk of developing the kidney disease.

 Kidney disease as used herein refers to an acute or chronic injury to at least one kidney of a subject and in particular renal tubular cell injury. Kidney injury can be confirmed by any of a number of measurable criteria known in the art including but not limited to measurement of the level of MA and renal function decline e.g. by measuring glomerular filtration rate GFR in a subject.

As used herein the expression renal tubular cell injury refers to a renal or kidney failure or dysfunction either sudden acute or slowly declining over time chronic . Kidney disease resulting in renal tubular cell injury can be triggered by a number of disease or disorder processes including but not limited to 1 for acute renal tubular cell injury ischemic renal injury IRI including acute ischemic injury and chronic ischemic injury acute renal failure acute nephrotoxic renal injury NRI toxicity including sepsis infection shock trauma kidney stones kidney infection drug toxicity poisons or toxins or after injection with an iodinated contrast dye adverse effect and 2 for chronic renal tubular cell injury diabetes T1DM or T2DM chronic infections chronic inflammation glomerulonephritides vascular diseases interstitial nephritis drugs toxins trauma renal stones long standing hypertension congestive heart failure nephropathy from sickle cell anemia and other blood dyscrasias nephropathy related to hepatitis HIV parvovirus and BK virus cystic kidney diseases congenital malformations obstruction malignancy kidney disease of indeterminate causes lupus nephritis membranous glomerulonephritis membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis focal glomerular sclerosis minimal change disease cryoglobulinemia ANCA positive vasculitis ANCA negative vasculitis amyloidosis multiple myeloma light chain deposition disease complications of kidney transplant chronic rejection of a kidney transplant chronic allograft nephropathy and the chronic effects of immunosuppressive drugs.

Kidney disease is a common problem in many patients suffering from diabetes. In particular diabetic nephropathy DN is a kidney disease that develops as a result of diabetes mellitus DM . DM affects approximately 5 of the U.S. population and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus T2DM is the most common cause of end stage renal disease ESRD in the U.S. Diabetic nephropathy is believed responsible for at least 25 of all renal dialysis patients. Approximately 25 to 40 of patients with DM ultimately develop DN which progresses through about five predictable stages culminating in end stage renal disease ESRD wherein renal replacement therapy e.g. hemodialysis peritoneal dialysis or kidney transplantation is required.

Diabetes can often result in DN and is thought to be caused by the progressive glycosylation of biomarkers leading to a progressive loss of renal function. Diabetic nephropathy generally results in a chronic and progressive degradation of kidney function to the point where the patient must undergo dialysis or receive a transplant to survive. Excretion of low but abnormal levels of albumin in the urine is considered a clinical marker of the incipient phase of nephropathy. As the glomeruli become increasingly filled with mesangial matrix products albuminuria increases and eventually gross proteinuria appears. Microalbuminuria MA is defined as excretion of 30 to 300 mg of albumin per day or an albumin creatinine ratio between 30 and 300 in a random urine specimen. Clinical proteinuria is defined as excretion of more than 0.5 g of total biomarker a day. However as previously discussed MA is not a good predictor of ESRD in subjects with diabetes because not all people who develop MA develop ESRD and not all subjects who develop ESRD also have evidence of MA. As such in some embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter the diagnostic methods disclosed herein can be used to diagnosis a diabetic subject with DN or at risk to develop DN even prior to presentation of clinical symptoms of DN.

The terms polypeptide protein and peptide which are used interchangeably herein refer to a polymer of the 20 protein amino acids including modified amino acids e.g. phosphorylated glycated etc. and amino acid analogs regardless of its size or function. Although protein is often used in reference to relatively large polypeptides and peptide is often used in reference to small polypeptides usage of these terms in the art overlaps and varies. The term peptide as used herein refers to peptides polypeptides proteins and fragments of proteins unless otherwise noted. The terms protein polypeptide and peptide are used interchangeably herein when referring to a gene product and fragments thereof. Thus exemplary polypeptides include gene products naturally occurring proteins homologs orthologs paralogs fragments and other equivalents variants fragments and analogs of the foregoing.

The terms polypeptide fragment or fragment when used in reference to a polypeptide refers to a polypeptide in which amino acid residues are absent as compared to the full length polypeptide itself but where the remaining amino acid sequence is usually identical to the corresponding positions in the reference polypeptide. Such deletions can occur at the amino terminus or carboxy terminus of the reference polypeptide or alternatively both. Fragments typically are at least 5 6 8 or 10 amino acids long at least 14 amino acids long at least 20 30 40 or 50 amino acids long at least 75 amino acids long or at least 100 150 200 300 500 or more amino acids long.

A fragment can retain one or more of the biological activities of the reference polypeptide. In some embodiments a fragment can comprise a domain or feature and optionally additional amino acids on one or both sides of the domain or feature which additional amino acids can number from 5 10 15 20 30 40 50 or up to 100 or more residues. Further fragments can include a sub fragment of a specific region which sub fragment retains a function of the region from which it is derived. When the term peptide is used herein it is intended to include the full length peptide as well as fragments of the peptide and measurable characteristics of the peptide. Thus an identified fragment of a peptide claimed e.g. see Tables 1 and 2 and SEQ ID NOs 1 59 is intended to encompass the fragment including measurable characteristics of the fragment such as mass spectrometry observed mass as well as the full length peptide. In some embodiments the kidney disease biomarker peptide can be referenced as in Tables 1 and 2 only by a measurable characteristic e.g. MS observed mass however it is intended that the full range of identifying characteristics including peptide sequence are intended to be encompassed by the presently disclosed subject matter. As one example when reference is made herein to antibodies specific for the peptides of Tables 1 or 2 it is intended that the antibodies can have specificity for the peptide fragment disclosed in the table and or the full length peptide.

The term biological sample as used herein refers to any body fluid or tissue potentially comprising one or more biomarkers associated with a kidney disease. In some embodiments for example the biological sample can be a saliva sample a blood sample a serum sample a plasma sample a urine sample or sub fractions thereof. In particular embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter the biological sample is a urine sample and the amounts of the one or more biomarkers determined for diagnosing a kidney disease are selected from Table 1. In other embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter the biological sample is a blood or plasma sample and the amounts of the one or more biomarkers determined for diagnosing a kidney disease are selected from Table 2.

The terms diagnosing and diagnosis as used herein refer to methods by which the skilled artisan can estimate and even determine whether or not a subject is suffering from a given disease or condition. The skilled artisan often makes a diagnosis on the basis of one or more diagnostic indicators such as for example a biomarker the amount including presence or absence of which is indicative of the presence severity or absence of the condition.

Along with diagnosis clinical disease prognosis is also an area of great concern and interest. It is important to know the stage and rapidity of advancement of the kidney disease in order to plan the most effective therapy. If a more accurate prognosis can be made appropriate therapy and in some instances less severe therapy for the patient can be chosen. Measurement of biomarker levels disclosed herein e.g. Tables 1 and 2 can be useful in order to categorize subjects according to advancement of kidney disease who will benefit from particular therapies and differentiate from other subjects where alternative or additional therapies can be more appropriate.

As such making a diagnosis or diagnosing as used herein is further inclusive of determining a prognosis which can provide for predicting a clinical outcome with or without medical treatment selecting an appropriate treatment or whether treatment would be effective or monitoring a current treatment and potentially changing the treatment based on the measure of diagnostic biomarker levels disclosed herein.

The phrase determining a prognosis as used herein refers to methods by which the skilled artisan can predict the course or outcome of a condition in a subject. The term prognosis does not refer to the ability to predict the course or outcome of a condition with 100 accuracy or even that a given course or outcome is predictably more or less likely to occur based on the presence absence or levels of test biomarkers. Instead the skilled artisan will understand that the term prognosis refers to an increased probability that a certain course or outcome will occur that is that a course or outcome is more likely to occur in a subject exhibiting a given condition when compared to those individuals not exhibiting the condition. For example in individuals not exhibiting the condition e.g. not expressing the biomarker or expressing it at a reduced level the chance of a given outcome may be about 3 . In certain embodiments a prognosis is about a 5 chance of a given outcome about a 7 chance about a 10 chance about a 12 chance about a 15 chance about a 20 chance about a 25 chance about a 30 chance about a 40 chance about a 50 chance about a 60 chance about a 75 chance about a 90 chance or about a 95 chance.

The skilled artisan will understand that associating a prognostic indicator with a predisposition to an adverse outcome is a statistical analysis. For example a biomarker level e.g. quantity of expression in a sample of greater than a control level in some embodiments can signal that a subject is more likely to suffer from a kidney disease than subjects with a level less than or equal to the control level as determined by a level of statistical significance. Additionally a change in marker concentration from baseline levels can be reflective of subject prognosis and the degree of change in marker level can be related to the severity of adverse events. Statistical significance is often determined by comparing two or more populations and determining a confidence interval and or a p value. See e.g. Dowdy and Wearden Statistics for Research John Wiley Sons New York 1983 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Preferred confidence intervals of the present subject matter are 90 95 97.5 98 99 99.5 99.9 and 99.99 while preferred p values are 0.1 0.05 0.025 0.02 0.01 0.005 0.001 and 0.0001.

In other embodiments a threshold degree of change in the level of a prognostic or diagnostic biomarker can be established and the degree of change in the level of the indicator in a biological sample can simply be compared to the threshold degree of change in the level. A preferred threshold change in the level for markers of the presently disclosed subject matter is about 5 about 10 about 15 about 20 about 25 about 30 about 50 about 75 about 100 and about 150 . In yet other embodiments a nomogram can be established by which a level of a prognostic or diagnostic indicator can be directly related to an associated disposition towards a given outcome. The skilled artisan is acquainted with the use of such nomograms to relate two numeric values with the understanding that the uncertainty in this measurement is the same as the uncertainty in the marker concentration because individual sample measurements are referenced not population averages.

In some embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter multiple determination of one or more diagnostic or prognostic peptide biomarkers can be made and a temporal change in the biomarker can be used to monitor the progression of disease and or efficacy of appropriate therapies directed against the disease. In such an embodiment for example one might expect to see a decrease or an increase in the biomarker s over time during the course of effective therapy. Thus the presently disclosed subject matter provides in some embodiments a method for determining treatment efficacy and or progression of a kidney disease in a subject. In some embodiments the method comprises determining an amount of at least one peptide biomarker associated with kidney disease such as for example at least one peptide of Table 1 Table 2 or both in biological samples collected from the subject at a plurality of different time points and comparing the amounts of the at least one peptide in the samples collected at different time points. For example a first time point can be selected prior to initiation of a treatment and a second time point can be selected at some time after initiation of the treatment. One or more biomarker levels can be measured in each of the samples taken from different time points and qualitative and or quantitative differences noted. A change in the amounts of the biomarker levels from the first and second samples can be correlated with determining treatment efficacy and or progression of the disease in the subject.

The terms correlated and correlating as used herein in reference to the use of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers refers to comparing the presence or quantity of the biomarker in a subject to its presence or quantity in subjects known to suffer from or known to be at risk of a given condition e.g. a kidney disease or in subjects known to be free of a given condition i.e. normal individuals . For example a biomarker level in a biological sample can be compared to a level known to be associated with a specific type of kidney disease. The sample s biomarker level is said to have been correlated with a diagnosis that is the skilled artisan can use the biomarker level to determine whether the subject suffers from a specific type of kidney disease and respond accordingly. Alternatively the sample s biomarker level can be compared to a control marker level known to be associated with a good outcome e.g. the absence of kidney disease such as an average level found in a population of normal subjects.

In certain embodiments a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker is correlated to a condition or disease by merely its presence or absence. In other embodiments a threshold level of a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker can be established and the level of the indicator in a subject sample can simply be compared to the threshold level.

As noted in some embodiments multiple determination of one or more diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers can be made and a temporal change in the marker can be used to determine a diagnosis or prognosis. For example a diagnostic marker can be determined at an initial time and again at a second time. In such embodiments an increase in the marker from the initial time to the second time can be diagnostic of a particular type of kidney disease or a given prognosis. Likewise a decrease in the marker from the initial time to the second time can be indicative of a particular type of kidney disease or a given prognosis. Furthermore the degree of change of one or more markers can be related to the severity of kidney disease and potential for future adverse events.

The skilled artisan will understand that while in certain embodiments comparative measurements can be made of the same diagnostic marker at multiple time points one can also measure a given marker at one time point and a second marker at a second time point and a comparison of these markers can provide diagnostic information.

Numerous methods and devices are well known to the skilled artisan for the detection and analysis of the biomarker peptides of the presently disclosed subject matter. With regard to polypeptides or proteins in subject test samples mass spectrometry and or immunoassay devices and methods can be used although other methods are well known to those skilled in the art for example the measurement of marker RNA levels . See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 143 576 6 113 855 6 019 944 5 985 579 5 947 124 5 939 272 5 922 615 5 885 527 5 851 776 5 824 799 5 679 526 5 525 524 and 5 480 792 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. These devices and methods can utilize labeled molecules in various sandwich competitive or non competitive assay formats to generate a signal that is related to the presence or amount of an analyte of interest. Additionally certain methods and devices such as biosensors and optical immunoassays can be employed to determine the presence or amount of analytes without the need for a labeled molecule. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 631 171 and 5 955 377 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

In certain embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter the biomarker peptides are analyzed using an immunoassay. The presence or amount of a peptide marker can be determined using antibodies or fragments thereof specific for each peptide marker and detecting specific binding. For example in some embodiments the antibody specifically binds a peptide of Table 1 or Table 2 which is inclusive of but not limited to antibodies that bind the full length peptide as well. In some embodiments the antibody is a monoclonal antibody.

Any suitable immunoassay can be utilized for example enzyme linked immunoassays ELISA radioimmunoassays RIAs competitive binding assays and the like. Specific immunological binding of the antibody to the marker can be detected directly or indirectly. Direct labels include fluorescent or luminescent tags metals dyes radionuclides and the like attached to the antibody. Indirect labels include various enzymes well known in the art such as alkaline phosphatase horseradish peroxidase and the like.

The use of immobilized antibodies or fragments thereof specific for the markers is also contemplated by the present subject matter. The antibodies can be immobilized onto a variety of solid substrates such as magnetic or chromatographic matrix particles the surface of an assay plate such as microtiter wells pieces of a solid substrate material such as plastic nylon paper and the like. An assay strip can be prepared by coating the antibody or a plurality of antibodies in an array on solid support. This strip can then be dipped into the test biological sample and then processed quickly through washes and detection steps to generate a measurable signal such as for example a colored spot.

In some embodiments a kit for the analysis of biomarkers is provided that comprises antibodies having specificity for one or more biomarkers associated with kidney disease. The antibodies can be bound to a substrate as disclosed herein. Such a kit can comprise devices and reagents for the analysis of at least one test sample. The kit can further comprise instructions for using the kit and conducting the analysis. Optionally the kits can contain one or more reagents or devices for converting a marker level to a diagnosis or prognosis of the subject.

In some embodiments mass spectrometry MS analysis can be used alone or in combination with other methods e.g. immunoassays to determine the presence and or quantity of the one or more biomarkers of interest in a biological sample. In some embodiments the MS analysis comprises matrix assisted laser desorption ionization MALDI time of flight TOF MS analysis such as for example direct spot MALDI TOF or liquid chromatography MALDI TOF mass spectrometry analysis. In some embodiments the MS analysis comprises electrospray ionization ESI MS such as for example liquid chromatography LC ESI MS. Mass analysis can be accomplished using commercially available spectrometers such as for example triple quadrupole mass spectrometers. Methods for utilizing MS analysis including MALDI TOF MS and ESI MS to detect the presence and quantity of biomarker peptides in biological samples are known in the art. See for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 925 389 6 989 100 and 6 890 763 for further guidance each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. In some embodiments the MS analysis can be utilized to identify specific polypeptide sequences and corresponding proteins and amounts compared to controls to diagnose a kidney disease. However MS analysis can also be utilized with the methods of the presently disclosed subject matter to determine a measurable characteristic of the peptide biomarkers and in particular a MS observed mass. As such determining an amount of one or more peptides of Tables 1 and 2 by MS analysis is inclusive of determining amounts of full length polypeptides inferred from peptide fragment analysis by MS specifically identified peptide e.g. polypeptide sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOs 1 59 fragment amounts as well as MS observed mass peak analysis.

The analysis of a plurality of markers can be carried out separately or simultaneously with one test sample. Several markers can be combined into one test for efficient processing of a multiple of samples. In addition one skilled in the art would recognize the value of testing multiple samples for example at successive time points from the same subject. Such testing of serial samples will allow the identification of changes in biomarker levels over time. Increases or decreases in marker levels as well as the absence of change in marker levels can provide useful information about the disease status that includes but is not limited to identifying the approximate time from onset of the disease the presence and amount of functioning tissue the appropriateness of drug therapies the effectiveness of various therapies differentiation of the various types and stages of kidney diseases identification of the severity of the disease and identification of the subject s outcome prognosis including risk of future events.

A panel consisting of biomarkers associated with a kidney disease e.g. the biomarker peptides of Tables 1 and or 2 can be constructed to provide relevant information related to the diagnosis or prognosis of the kidney disease and management of subjects with the kidney disease. Such a panel can be constructed for example using 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 15 or 20 individual biomarkers. The analysis of a single marker or subsets of markers comprising a larger panel of markers can be carried out by one skilled in the art to optimize clinical sensitivity or specificity in various clinical settings. These include but are not limited to ambulatory urgent care critical care intensive care monitoring unit in patient out patient physician office medical clinic and health screening settings. Furthermore one skilled in the art can use a single marker or a subset of markers comprising a larger panel of markers in combination with an adjustment of the diagnostic threshold in each of the aforementioned settings to optimize clinical sensitivity and specificity. The clinical sensitivity of an assay is defined as the percentage of those with the disease that the assay correctly predicts and the specificity of an assay is defined as the percentage of those without the disease that the assay correctly predicts Tietz Textbook of Clinical Chemistry 2.sup.nd edition Carl Burtis and Edward Ashwood eds. W.B. Saunders and Company p. 496 .

The analysis of markers can be carried out in a variety of physical formats as well. For example the use of microtiter plates or automation could be used to facilitate the processing of large numbers of test samples. Alternatively single sample formats can be developed to facilitate immediate treatment and diagnosis in a timely fashion for example in ambulatory transport or emergency room settings.

The following Examples have been included to illustrate modes of the presently disclosed subject matter.

We have identified several peptides from a number of unique gene products see Table 1 that are present in the urine and are discriminatory markers of renal function decline RFD in Type 1 diabetes TI DM patients with microalbuminuria MA . Three novel approaches were employed to identify the biomarkers patient sample selection peptide extraction and analysis.

Sample Selection The urine samples we studied to identify biomarkers of diabetic RFD were obtained from T1DM patients. The samples we studied were collected from a time n 62 point preceding any loss of GFR. Samples used were developed from the 1Joslin Cohort of the NIH funded project titled Natural History Study of Microalbuminuria in Type 1 Diabetes R01 DK41526 . A cohort of 1394 T1DM individuals was followed for 8 10 years. Patient samples used to generate our preliminary data presented with confirmed MA albumin excretion rate AER of 30 300 g min during the two years preceding urine collection. Patients with non diabetic kidney disease were excluded. The urine samples were matched between groups for age 54.5 yr 5 yr gender and glycemic control Hb Alc levels . Case samples n 19 encompassed individuals with significant early progressive renal function decline. These individuals experienced an annual loss of more than 3.4 mL yr in their estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFR as measured by serum cystatin C. Control samples n 42 encompassed individuals with renal function decline that was approximately equal to the loss experienced as a result of the normal aging process. These individuals experienced an annual loss of less than 3.4 mL yr in their estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFR as measured by serum cystatin C. The samples analyzed to generate the presently disclosed biomarkers were developed from banked patient urine samples collected before any of the patients experienced RFD. Thus observed differences in the urine peptidome can reflect or correlate with the future development of RFD.

Peptide Extraction The method used to extract urine peptides for biomarker studies is one developed and optimized by our group over the last three years. Briefly peptides were isolated from urine in a two step process. The urine peptides were first size selected from the proteins by ultrafiltration that produced a low molecular weight peptide panel having a mass less than 10 000 Daltons. We have determined from several hundred analyses that as little as 1 mL urine provides 500 g urinary peptide as BCA peptide assay positive material . A single capillary HPLC analysis requires 1 5 g peptide and hence enough peptide material for the proposed project from a single mL of urine. The peptides were then concentrated desalted and mass quantified.

Data Acquisition and Analysis Equivalent masses of peptides were separated by 1D RP capillary HPLC and analyzed using high sensitivity high throughput MALDI TOF MS. A challenge in using MS analysis of clinical samples is the remarkable dimensionality of the spectra data sets. Our data analysis approach is to apply both supervised and unsupervised informatic methods. In our approach statistical analysis of urinary peptide profiles using LC MALDI peak lists began with unsupervised sorting of the MS data using Principle Components Analysis PCA or Hierarchical Clustering HC followed by group annotation. This approach is more robust and has less intrinsic bias. In some cases supervised sorting of the sample MS data was required. In those cases the investigator assigned the MS spectral data into groups. Principle data sets were developed from MALDI TOF spectral files. Here the data were extracted from MALDI TOF spectral files .t2d files using instrument manufacturer software PEAK EXPLORER and these peak lists were imported into analytical statistical software for analysis. One software package MARKERVIEW imports the peak list data as .txt files. Peak list data contains information for peptide retention time m z and signal response. These data were then imported with use of filters to remove masses associated with internal standards and matrix contaminants adjustment of retention times and for mass accuracy. In either case of group membership assigned by unsupervised or supervised methods MS spectral data were compared by univariate student s t test or Mann Whitney t test constrained by false discovery rate analysis FDR or multivariate methods PCA RandomForest RE or receiver operator characteristic ROC curves . With these approaches we were able to simultaneously analyze thousands of features. To correct for simultaneous multiple hypothesis testing we estimated the q value for every feature in order to estimate the FDR. We assumed a false discovery rate of 0.10 was acceptable and hence any feature with a q value less than 0.10 was considered significant. Peptide masses having sufficient specificity to sort MALDI TOF MS spectra into groups were tabulated and selected for MALDI TOF MS MS analysis

Prior to PCA analysis by MARKERVIEW data were imported preprocessed using logarithmic data weighting and automatic data scaling filters. Patient urinary peptide samples were assigned to Groups and the imported preprocessed data compared by two univariate statistical methods unpaired two tailed students t test and Mann Whitney test to discern peptides that were presented at levels significantly different between Groups. Only patient samples representing the extremes of eventual RFD or stability were initially selected for analysis n 15 . Unsupervised PCA demonstrates that dominate differences in the patients urinary peptide profiles sort the samples into two clear groups.

In addition to PCA analysis an expanded sample set n 49 of individuals with low to moderate RFD 3.5 mL yr and moderate to high RFD 3.5 mL yr were used for unsupervised sorting analysis. Here the LC MALDI TOF MS peak list data were classified with their urinary polypeptide profiles using HC classification algorithms with subsequent selection of classifying peptides by RF and ROC analyses. We calculated the most important features determined by the RF algorithm in terms of Gini index and mean square error. In order to minimize the effect of stochastic nature of the RF procedure we ran the algorithm a large number of times 100 and determined the most important common features amongst all the runs. RF was utilized for selection of variables with two measures of variable importance utilized 1 average decrease in classification accuracy and 2 Gini importance average decrease of Gini index . RF parameters were estimated by minimizing generalization error estimate and maximizing stability of variable ranking computed as the cardinality of intersection of the 20 top ranked features over 100 RF runs. After each run variables with corresponding importance measures smaller or equal to 0 were discarded. Following supervised and unsupervised comparison we have identified upwards of 40 peptides that were associated with RFD in diabetics.

Analysis of MALDI TOF MS Data Sets The statistical analysis of the data was broken down into three types of analysis class discovery class prediction and class differentiation methods. With all methods the MS data sets were developed using aligned LC MALDI TOF MS peptide peak lists with the peptide data arrayed as mass m z 1 and retention time pairs. Peptide abundance was assigned based on the peptide MALDI TOF MS ion cluster area.

Class discovery methods The class discovery methods used primarily involved several types of cluster analysis. Initially Principal Components Analysis PCA and hierarchical cluster analysis using a variety of weight correlation Euclidian and link functions average single complete was conducted. In addition the non hierarchical cluster K means clusters was used on the data. We used s n 3 and s n 10 data with and without natural log. PCA is a graphical method to illustrate similarities of different samples within groups based on sample characteristics such as peptide abundance in the present study. A PCA plot illustrates the relationship of sample or sample data based on the two dominate sets of sample variance. Therefore a PCA plot is a qualitative tool to define sample groups in an unbiased fashion. Classical parametric and non parametric tests can then be used to identify the specific differences between the groups.

Class differentiation methods To determine differences in peak intensity between the cases and controls we used a t test and adjusted the p values using a Benjamini and Hochberg False Discover Rate procedure. We addressed the problem by holding RFD as a continuum of pathophysiology and analyzed the entire MS data set. The slope of the decline in renal function and well as covariate data was regressed on the peak intensities s n3 s n 10 with and without natural log scaling and significance was assessed using simple linear regression and correlations with Pearson s correlation. This has the effect of assigning no specific rate of RFD to distinguish decliners from non decliners. The data were then analyzed for correlation of peptide abundance with RFD slope glm using Spearman correlations calculations for the intensity of peptide mass retention time pairs and slope glm. Peptide mass rt pairs with Spearman correlation values 0.3 and 

Class prediction discriminate analysis Using the unselected s n 3 and s n 10 data separately we conducted discriminate analysis using a grid of significance levels 0.01 0.05 0.2 on the decliner verses non decliner patients. We evaluated a number of multivariate classification methods including the Compound Covariate Predictor Diagonal Linear Discriminant Analysis Nearest Neighbor Predictor Nearest Centroid Predictor and Support Vector Machine Predictor. We used leave one out cross validation to generate the final models as well as to determine the accuracy of the models. Sensitivity specificity Positive and Negative predictive values for each of the models was obtained.

We hypothesized that qualitative differences in urine proteins might provide insight into the etiology of progressive ERFD and serve as putative biomarkers of risk of progressive ERFD. To address this hypothesis in these examples we have performed proteomic and peptidomic analyses of urine samples obtained during the Joslin Study of the Natural History of Microalbuminuria in Type 1 Diabetes. In the present examples the low molecular weight protein 

Patient Selection and Case Definition for Early Renal Function Decline ERFD . The protocol and consent procedures were approved by the Committee on Human Studies of the Joslin Diabetes Center and the University of Louisville. Among the 943 patients with normoalbuminuria enrolled in the 1Joslin Study of the Natural History of Microalbuminuria in Type 1 Diabetes MA developed in 109 during the first four years of follow up it is this cohort of 109 patients with a documented onset of MA that is the population potentially eligible for this study.

Diagnoses of normoalbuminuria and microalbumuria were based on multiple measurements of the albumin excretion rate in micrograms per minute which was estimated from the albumin to creatinine ratio in random urine samples as previously described. 1 2 Eighty six patients were followed until 2007 and 61 met the following additional criteria for inclusion in the analysis 1 follow up examinations spanning at least 8 years after the onset of MA for the estimation of the slope of GFR over time 2 at least one 6 ml aliquot of stored urine from an examination within five years of the onset of MA for analysis of peptide components. Among available urine samples the earliest after MA onset was selected.

The 61 patients were divided into cases of ERFD and controls according to the regression slope fitted to their follow up estimates of GFR based on serum cystatin C cC GFR . The protocol used for assessment of early progressive renal function decline has been described in detail previously. 8 17 In brief glomerular filtration rate in ml min was approximated numerically by the reciprocal of cystatin C in mg L multiplied by 100. A regression slope fitted to serial measurements of cC GFR over eight years accurately tracks the trend in renal function over that time. Patients had on average 4.8 cC GFR estimates. As previously published we used the longitudinal data available from the Baltimore Aging Study as the reference distribution for evaluating whether a negative slope or trend in renal function qualified as an abnormal rate of decline designated early renal function decline or ERFD . 7 

Sample Handling and Peptide Isolation. The order of case or control sample handling during peptide isolation was randomized to minimize technical or methodological bias during data collection. Urinary peptides were isolated from the urine less than 10 kDa ultrafiltrate by solid phase extraction SPE methods filtered through regenerated cellulose syringe filter 0.2 m National Scientific Co. and transferred to autosampler vials in a final concentration of 0.1 g L.

Peptides 5 g were separated using a reversed phase capillary scale column Dionex 75 m I.D. Nano Series Column C18 PepMap 100 3 m 100 with 45 min Solvent A 0.05 trifluoroacetic acid TFA to Solvent B 80 acetonitrile ACN 0.05 TFA gradient and 45 1 min fractions were collected with a robotic fraction collector Accuspot Shimadzu Corp. Kyoto Japan . MALDI matrix 5 mg mL CN Cyano 4 hydroxycinnamic acid and a 5.33 fmol L angiotensin I AT I standard dissolved in 50 ACN 0.1 TFA was overlaid onto dried LC fractions collected on archivable MALDI sample plates ABI Opti TOF plates post run using the Accuspot to include an internal mass calibration standard at 4 fmol AT I per spot.

Positive ion MALDI TOF mass spectra were acquired using an Applied Biosystems Foster City Calif. AB4700 Proteomics Analyzer operating in reflectron mode and with ion source pressure 0.5 pTorr. After a 400 ns time delayed ion extraction period the ions were accelerated to 20 kV for TOF mass spectrometric analysis. A total of 1000 laser shots 355 nm Nd YAG solid state laser operating at 200 Hz were acquired and signal averaged. MALDI TOF spectra were exported as .t2d files as well as peak list files for chromatographic data alignment and for analysis by MarkerView MDS Sciex .

Analysis of MALDI TOF MS Data Sets. Aligned MS data sets were constructed peptide mass m z 1 and retention time pairs with peptide abundance based on the MS ion cluster area. The prevalence of peptide abundance was determined. Cases of early renal function decline were defined by loss in GFR that exceeded 3.3 yr a threshold that corresponds to the 2.5th percentile of the distribution of GFR slopes in an independent non diabetic normotensive population. Observed peptide masses were assigned an intensity of 1 and unobserved masses assigned an intensity of 0 . The fractional abundance f of each case and control peptide was used to compute a fractional abundance ratio f f . Fractional abundance ratio s greater than 1.5 or less than 0.5 in case to control ratios were considered significantly differentially expressed within the two populations. The fractional abundance ratios for these peptides were reconsidered using only the patient samples found in the first and third tertile. Peptides having a ratio that became more extreme greater than 1.5 or less than 0.5 were tabulated for further MS MS analyses. To determine the correlation of peptide expression with ERFD the slope of the decline in renal function slope glm was regressed on the s n 3 peak intensities with natural log scaling and significance was assessed using simple linear regression and correlations with Spearman rank order correlation analysis for the tertile extremes. The Spearman correlation coefficients values were filtered using minimum correlation cutoff values of less than or equal to 0.4 or greater than or equal to 0.4. The goodness of the correlation fit was determined by a t test filter. All peptides having a minimum Spearman correlation coefficient value and parametric t tests with a p value less than 0.01 were considered as significant. Peptides having parametric t tests p

Peptide Sequence Tagging of Selected Peptide Ions using MALDI TOF TOF MS. Fragmentation data post source decay PSD and collision induced dissociation CID data were collected for each tabulated peptide using the AB4700 MALDI TOF TOF using 1 KeV collision energy atmospheric gases medium pressure and collection averaged data from 1500 laser shots.

Concatenated lists of averaged fragmentation spectra PSD and CID were submitted for computer assisted data analysis. Analyses were conducted in an iterative fashion with the concatenated lists starting with search parameters of a mass accuracy of 0.15 Da for peptides and 0.3 Da for fragment masses. Sequence tagging analyses of MALDI TOF TOF spectra were achieved using a combination of Global Protein Server GPS software Applied Biosystems Foster City Calif. and Matrix Science Mascot version 2.1 with manual review of all returned analyses. Peptide fragmentation peak lists were searched against the unconstrained non enzyme NCBInr 20060712 database 3783042 sequences 1304471729 residues with taxonomy 111934 sequences initially with no PTM s and proceeding sequentially with addition of possible PTM s sodiation and hydroxylation. Mascot search of the MALDI TOF TOF data proceeded with assuming possible hydroxylation of lysine K asparagine N proline P and possible sodiation of aspartic acid D or glutamic acid E side chains or carboxy termini. Returned Mascot probabilistic scores for peptides of 67 indicate identity or extensive homology p

Immunohistochemistry IHC . A modified version of a previously described IHC protocol was used. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded kidney sections from human biopsy specimens were obtained and sections were dewaxed treated with antigen unmasking solution H 3300 from Vector Laboratories Inc Burlingame Calif. and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked. Kidney sections were selected from three different normal disease control and disease biopsy specimens. Kidney sections were blocked probed with primary antibody 1 1 000 dilution mouse polyclonal antibody to IPP2K cat. no. H00064768 A01 Novus Biologicals Inc Littleton Colo. probed with secondary antibody and treated with ABC reagent. For negative controls serial sections were stained as before with the exception of no primary antibody. Processed sections were scored by three blinded individuals using a scoring rubric for staining to nuclei cytoplasm basement membrane and interstitium. Negative control and deletion control experiments were conducted to optimize for antibody combination antibody concentration incubation times and order of antibody visualization.

The study population was comprised of the patients whose onset of microalbuminuria MA was documented in the 1st Joslin Study of the Natural History of Microalbuminuria in Type 1 Diabetes. Additional eligibility criteria included follow up examinations spanning at least 8 years after MA onset for estimating the rate of GFR decline and availability of a 6 ml aliquot of stored urine for peptide analysis. The 61 patients who met all eligibility criteria were subdivided into 19 cases with early renal function decline defined as a decline of 3.3 or more per year range 3.3 to 16.1 per year and 42 controls with lesser rates of renal function decline range 1.9 to 3.2 per year . For illustration contrasting examples of longitudinal changes in renal function are shown in . Both patients had T1D and MA. The control patient experienced age appropriate renal function decline approximately 1 per year while the case patient with ERFD progressed to end stage renal disease.

Characteristics of the case and control groups are summarized in Table 3 at the onset of MA Section A and at the examination approximately 3 years later that provided the urine sample for peptide analysis Section B . All patients were Caucasian and the groups had similar distributions of sex and duration of diabetes at the onset of MA. ERFD cases were older and had higher average glycated hemoglobin A1c than controls but had the same estimated GFR cC GFR Table 3 section A . At the time of urine sampling for peptide analysis Table 3 Section B the groups had similar MA duration blood pressure urinary albumin excretion and medications. Glycated hemoglobin continued to be higher in cases than controls. The cC GFR had declined slightly in both cases and controls from the time of MA onset but still remained in the normal range. The cC GFR was not below 60 ml min in any patient during these baseline intervals. At the end of follow up Table 3 Section C the mean duration of follow up from the onset of MA for both cases and controls was approximately 12 years about 10 years after the time when urine samples were obtained for this study . By design the rate of renal function loss cC GFR slope was much greater in cases of ERFD 6.5 per year mean change than in controls 1.4 per year mean change . As a result of this disparity in renal function deterioration advanced chronic kidney disease or end stage renal disease developed in half of the cases.

Statistical analysis of the LC MALDI TOF MS data sets presented several challenges. First only a few individual peptides were observed in every sample. For example while 5 297 different peptides were observed only 1 206 peptides were present in 50 of samples. The large numbers of undetected peptides introduced an equivalently large number of null values into the data sets thus discouraging the application of classical t test methods to select for differentially expressed peptides.

In order to focus effort on the most promising peptides we imposed three stringent criteria for selecting peptides for further analysis. First we eliminated the 3 364 peptides that were detected in less than 25 of the samples. Second we required that there be a 50 difference in the detection frequency of a peptide between cases and controls. This reduced the number of peptides to 12. Third we added a quantitative requirement to the evidence for association. Peptide quantity was calculated from its peak characteristics using integrated signal intensity. We then calculated the Spearman correlation coefficient between the peptide abundance and the rate of renal function loss and selected four peptides with strong correlation Table 4 for further analysis in these examples. All four had coefficients less than 0.40 and a p value less than 0.01

The discriminating peptides present in urine had a molecular weight m z ranging approximately from 842 to 1838 Da and therefore might be present in the urine after being freely filtered from the plasma by the glomerulus. To investigate the source of the selected peptides we conducted additional LC MALDI TOF MS experiments of plasma samples obtained with the urine samples we had analyzed. We performed LC MALDI TOF MS analysis of plasma peptides isolated from samples collected from the same individuals supplying the urine samples used in this study. The samples were available from 18 case and 18 control patients. The isolated serum peptides were analyzed using identical LC MALDI TOF MS methods employing chromatography retention time internal standards and on plate per spot internal mass calibration standards.

One plasma peptide was detected in a majority of plasma samples at the correct chromatographic retention time and with the correct mass 1190.638 m z 150 ppm mass accuracy to be assigned to one of the four urinary peptides which correlating with ERFD and which were further analyzed in the present examples. However there was no difference in this peptide s plasma abundance between Case and Control patients.

To better understand ERFD mechanisms we sought to identify the protein source for the discriminating urinary peptides selected for further analysis in these examples. We performed tandem mass spectrometry analysis to identify the amino acid sequence of the discriminating urine peptides.

As seen in Table 5 a total of three peptide sequence identifications were made including fragments of the cadherin like protein FAT tumor suppressor 2 ZO 3 and a fragment of IPP2K. Further MS analysis demonstrated that the 1838.782 m z ion had a peptide sequence having a missed trypsin cleavage site due to the presence of a glycyl glycyl post translational modification presumed resulting from ubiquitination of the parent protein IPP2K.

We examined if intact IPP2K was present and also differentially expressed in case and control urine protein samples. In preparing samples for peptidomic analysis we had isolated a fraction containing proteins with molecular size 10 000 Da. These samples were then resolved by 10 SDS PAGE and IPP2K was identified by immunoblot.

As show in IPP2K was detectable in urine and was approximately 2.6 times greater in patients with ERFD who subsequently developed advanced chronic kidney disease.

We examined whether urinary peptide levels might provide insight into disease induced changes in renal protein expression. We first analyzed IPP2K expression in kidneys from normal and diabetic patients by immunohistochemistry. In keeping with our focus on ERFD for these examples we analyzed biopsies from diabetic patients with minimal albuminuria and serum creatinine levels of 1.2 to 1.9 mg dl.

Shown in are representative images from six pairs of experiments that examined IPP2K expression in kidneys from normal patients a patient with early DN and negative control for non specific binding . Patients with DN had increased IPP2K expression in renal tubules and glomeruli. While the majority of increased staining was observed in the cytoplasm intense areas of staining were noted in nuclei or perinuclear areas.

IPP2K has been shown recently to be a constituent of mRNA containing granules responsible for protein translation arrest in stressed cells 9 . These cytoplasmic inclusions referred to as stress granules are observed in cells subjected to environmental stress including heat irradiation oxidative conditions and hyperosmolarity 10 . Based on our findings of increased renal and urinary IPP2K in ERFD we examined if DN was associated with the formation of stress granules.

Shown in is a 100 magnification image of DN kidney stained for IPP2K. Increased IPP2K staining is seen throughout and is strongly localized in cytoplasmic granules. IPP2K was strongly expressed in nuclei or peri nuclear areas. We also used immunohistochemistry to determine expression of another protein marker of stress granules T cell intracellular antigen 1 related protein TIAR . Shown in are sections stained for TIAR from normal kidney E or early diabetic nephropathy F . We observed increased TIAR staining in diabetic nephropathy. TIAR was primarily localized to the cytoplasm and in a granular pattern indicative of stress granules.

To further examine if urine peptide changes may reflect alterations in intact kidney proteins we analyzed ZO 3 expression in kidneys from normal and diabetic patients by immuno histochemistry. We used the same biopsies studied above from diabetic patients with minimal albuminuria and serum creatinine levels of 1.2 to 1.9 mg dl. As shown in ZO 3 expression was increased in biopsies from patients with DN B when compared to controls A . We also observed that ZO 3 staining was less linear not confined to the cell periphery and increased in the cytoplasm when compared to normals.

Our goal in these examples was to identify urinary peptides that are associated specifically with the risk of kidney diseases including ERFD an early phenotype that indicates the initiation of renal function loss while GFR is still in the normal range and while MA is present. Urine samples available in this study were unique They were taken from subjects early after the development of MA and could be classified into cases and controls according to their future changes in renal function. As such the samples could be used to measure peptides that may discriminate those that retain stable renal function from those with ERFD. We reasoned if such discriminating peptides could be identified that they would be specific for ERFD and might provide new insights into the pathophysiology the initiation of renal function loss as opposed to the onset of MA and could serve as candidate biomarkers in future studies. We focused on 4 identified peptides for these examples. Each was more abundant in the urine of cases as compared to the urine of well matched controls. MS sequence tag analysis identified individual peptide fragments of derived from the tight junction protein 3 ZO 3 FAT 2 and IPP2K. The novel findings in these examples include that changes in renal protein expression in diabetes are reflected in the urinary peptidome and occur very early in DN. Secondly based on the urine peptidomic analysis we were able to determine that intact IPP2K protein is increased in diabetic kidney and is present in stress granules not observed in normal kidney.

Based on the differential expression of an IPP2K urinary fragment in case and control samples we examined whether this protein was differentially regulated in normal kidneys and those from patients with T1D. We observed increased expression of IPP2K in renal tubules of patients with T1D compared to normal kidney. Increased IPP2K expression was observed both in nuclei and in the cytoplasm. This finding suggests a hitherto unrecognized role for IPP2K in the damaged kidney or in kidneys responding to stress. IPP2K may have several possible roles in DN. Higher inositol phosphate production proceeds through the action of a IP5 6 kinase to produce Ins 1 3 4 6 P4 which in turn is acted on by a IP5 kinase to produce Ins 1 3 4 5 6 P5 that is then modified by IPP2K to produce InsP6 11 12 . The role in renal cell function of IPP2K is incompletely understood and the actions of InsP6 the primary product of IPP2K activity are a focus of considerable interest. One major role for IPP2K has been in the regulation of mature messenger RNA nuclear export and mRNA translation arrest during cellular stress 13 . Most recently cytoplasmic IPP2K has been associated with stress granule formation. Stress granules are phase dense cytoplasmic particles that appear in eukaryotic cells exposed to environmental stress e.g. oxidative conditions hyperosmolarity nutrient depravation and UV irradiation . Stress granule assembly is a consequence of abortive translational initiation. If the stress is relieved the stress granules disassemble and translation resumes. The persistence of stress granules is considered a reflection of ongoing insults that if left unchecked may lead to apoptotic cell death. We observed evidence of stress granules in kidneys with early diabetic nephropathy as well as in other renal diseases suggesting that stress induced changes in translation had occurred.

We also observed that increased amounts of urine peptides derived from the ZO 3 protein reflected changes in the diabetic kidney. Diabetic kidneys had increased tubule cell ZO 3 expression and apparent translocation of the protein from the cell membrane to cytoplasm. ZO 3 is a member of the zona occludens protein family found in epithelial cell apical junction complexes 14 . Zona occludens proteins play an important role in maintaining barrier integrity formed by epithelial cells and loss of ZO 3 in particular results in increased permeability of cell layers 15 . Recently Sharma et al. have shown glucose causes translocation of ZO 1 from the cell membrane to the cytoplasm in cultured podocytes 16 . Similarly we observed increased cytoplasmic and decreased membrane ZO 3 staining in renal tubules in human diabetic kidneys. These data indicate that increased ZO 3 fragments in the urine may be a result of the diabetes induced change in ZO 3 cellular distribution.

In summary we have identified peptides in the low molecular fraction of urine that correlate with early renal function decline in Type 1 diabetes mellitus. These peptides reflect changes in both tubular and glomerular protein expression that are associated with the formation of stress granules and may define a new cellular mechanism by which diabetic nephropathy is initiated or progresses. Thus urine peptide expression can provide insight into renal pathophysiologic mechanisms.

This Example provides comparison of peptide profiles of plasma samples collected from type 1 diabetic individuals prior to the onset of significant renal function decline. It was determined that discernable changes in the plasma peptidome accompany early progressive renal function decline in type 1 diabetics with microalbuminuria.

Longitudinal patient study allowed for stratification of patient renal function into two groups significant renal function decline case and age equivalent renal function decline control . Peptide profiles generated using liquid chromatography LC robotic fraction collection and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry MALDI TOF MS were compared using class discovery and class differentiation methods.

A total of 213 peptide masses out of 9 000 peptide masses were identified as being differentially present to some degree between case and control groups. Manual review of the data allowed for rank ordering of peptide importance based on apparent abundance within samples. Peptides having significant abundance e.g. a signal to noise s n ratio 50 were selected for further studies dedicated to identifying the peptide s amino acid sequence.

Initial analysis provided sixty three 63 peptides were significant by univariate t test analysis at the p

Summary The experiments noted in Example 10 identified eight peptide sequences as derived from the biologically important peptide bradykinin including one apparently previously unknown variant of bradykinin. Bradykinin a proteolytic fragment of the protein kininogen and differential expression of bradykinin receptors B1KR and B2KR are of known significant importance to renal function Tan et al. 2007 Am J Physiol Renal Physiol. 293 4 F1026 35 .

Differential plasma expression of the bradykinin parent protein kininogen has been established in the data of the present example using immunoblot analysis of early progressive renal function decline phenotypic extremes.

A question addressed by the present example was are the urinary peptides identified as differentially abundant in case versus control patients actually filtered from the plasma through the glomerulus into the urine . We were able to demonstrate that none of the significant urinary peptides originated from the plasma. The analysis of LC MS data from these 33 plasma samples n 16 case n 17 control identified 63 peptides to be significantly difference between case and control groups by t test p

Background Two splice variants of kininogen occur with the larger variant referred to as high molecular weight kininogen HK and the smaller variant referred to low molecular weight kininogen LK . HK contains six protein domains including protease inhibitor domains a cytokeratin binding domain a gC1qR binding domain a prekallikrein Factor XI binding domain and a domain containing the peptide hormone bradykinin BK . BK is released from HK primarily by the proteolytic activity of plasma kallikrein. BK binds to the constitutively expressed bradykinin 1 receptor B1R a G protein coupled receptor. BK can be degraded by a number of metalloproteinases including the protease Kininase II also known as angiotensin AT converting enzyme ACE . Interestingly ACE has a higher affinity for BK than for AT. ACE inhibitors are used to treat hypertension in hypertensive diabetics and have a beneficial side effect of reducing proteinuria. Some people ascribe the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors to the resulting increase in BK half life and resulting increase in effective tissue BK concentration. The proteolysis of LK by tissue kallikrein releases decapeptide known as kalladin and corresponds to BK plus an additional N terminal lysine also known as Lys bradykinin . BK and kalladin are both proteolytically degraded by enzymes in the kidney and yield the hepta hexa and penta polypeptides which were observed in the low molecular proteomic studies conducted in our preliminary studies. The release of BK from HK yields a heavy chain having a molecular weight range of approximately 68 000 to 65 000 Daltons and a light chain having a molecular weight of approximately 58 000 Daltons subsequently the light chain is further degraded to fragments with a mass range of 49 000 to 42 000 Daltons. The two chains are held together by a single disulfide bond. The heavy chain contains multiple N linked glycan structures and the light chain contains multiple O linked glycan structures. Therefore the differential abundance of BK peptides and BK degradation products should be reflected by the differential abundance of kininogen heavy chain and light chain proteins in the plasma of case versus control patients.

Methods In order to examine if the increased plasma abundance of kininogen fragments was the result of increased kininogen protein expression immunoblotting experiments using reduced and denatured plasma protein samples were conducted. The plasma samples were enriched for low abundant proteins including kininogen by depleting albumin using albumin specific antibody methods VivaScience Sartorius Germany . Samples were prepared using 10 g of depleted plasma proteins dissolved in Laemmli buffer separated using 10 NuPAGE gels at 200V constant and electroblotted onto 0.45 m nitrocellulose. The blocked membrane was immunoblotted using rabbit anti high molecular weight kininogen polyclonal antibodies in Odyssey infrared imaging blocking buffer Licor Lincoln Nebr. supplemented with 0.1 Tween 20. Proteins were visualized by incubation of membranes with fluorescent tagged anti rabbit antibodies Molecular Probes Carlsbad Calif. and scanning on an Odyssey infrared imager Licor .

Results Immunoblot experiments were conducted using polyclonal antibodies to high molecular weight kininogen. The samples selected for these experiments were composed of the phenotypic extremes the patients who through 12 20 years longitudinal follow up demonstrated the most case and least control severe loss of renal function . These immunoblot experiments identified multiple immunopositive bands migrating at molecular weight ranges between approximately 56 000 and 38 000 Daltons. Data are presented for the analysis of case n 3 and control n 3 samples for the bands migrating between 49 000 and 38 000 Daltons and a single band migrating between 65 000 and 49 000 Daltons . From these data and an additional three samples a Pearson analysis for the correlation of band intensities with the estimated rates of renal function decline computed a correlation coefficient of 0.8. The strength of this correlation coefficient suggests that kininogen metabolism is dysregulated between T1D MA individuals with and without early progressive renal function decline.
