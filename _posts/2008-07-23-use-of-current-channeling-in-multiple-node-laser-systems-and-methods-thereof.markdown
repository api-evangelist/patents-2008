title: Use of current channeling in multiple node laser systems and methods thereof
abstract: Current channels, blocking areas, or strips in a semiconductor laser are used to channel injected current into the antinodal region of the optical standing wave present in the optical cavity, while restricting the current flow to the nodal regions. Previous devices injected current into both the nodal and antinodal regions of the wave, which is fed by the population inversion created in the active region by the injected electrons and holes, but inversion created in the nodal regions is lost to fluorescence or supports the creation of undesirable competing longitudinal modes, causing inefficiency. Directing current to the antinodal regions where the electric field is at its maximum causes a selected longitudinal mode to preferentially oscillate regardless of where the longitudinal mode lies with respect to the gain curve. In one embodiment, exacting fabrication of the Fabry-Perot cavity correlates the current channels to antinodal regions, vis-a vis current blocking areas, strips or segmented layers.

The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for manufacturing a semiconductor laser device which can be used in an optical communication system telecommunications CD DVD data storage and players diode pumped solid state lasers. The present invention is particularly useful in applications where high power efficiency and wavelength stability are at a premium.

The typical laser comprises a gain medium positioned within a highly reflective optical cavity and a power source which supplies energy to the gain medium. The process of supplying the energy required for the amplification is called pumping. The pumping energy is typically supplied as an electrical current to the gain medium. Light is amplified by stimulated emission due to the properties of the gain medium. An optical cavity generally comprises two reflective surfaces or mirrors arranged such that light bounces back and forth repeatedly through the gain medium. Typically the output reflective surface is partially transparent through which light is emitted. The other reflective surface may also be partially reflective and used in conjunction with feedback circuitry. During laser operation light of a specific wavelength passes through the gain medium and is amplified repeatedly. A portion of the light passes through the partially transparent reflective surface and is outputted as a beam of light.

The present invention relates to laser diodes where the gain or active medium is a semiconductor formed from a p n junction and powered by injected electrical current which provides the stimulated emission. Semiconductor lasers include an active or gain layer or region by which a standing optical wave is created responsive to current flow. In a typical double heterostructure laser diode the active layer is of low band gap material that is sandwiched between two high band gap layers. In such a laser diode an optical waveguide is produced such that the light is confined to a relatively narrow line. The two ends are cleaved to form perfectly smooth parallel edges forming a Fabry Perot resonator. Photons emitted into a mode of the waveguide will travel along the waveguide and be reflected several times from each end face before they are emitted.

Generally the wavelength of light emitted from a semiconductor laser is a function of the band gap of the semiconductor and the modes of the optical cavity. For example the band gap wavelength for InGaAsP may be on the order of approximately 1.0 to 1.115 m depending upon the configuration of the laser. In general the maximum gain will occur for photons with energy slightly above the band gap energy and the modes nearest the gain peak will lase most strongly. If the diode is driven strongly enough additional side modes may also lase. For example if the oscillation wavelength is from 1100 nm to 1550 nm or on the order of 10meters and the length of the resonator is L the mode interval of the longitudinal mode generated by the resonator of the semiconductor laser device can be expressed by the following equation where refractive index is n. 2 nL .

As the length of the resonator increases the mode interval of the longitudinal mode becomes narrower and the selection condition s of the emitting the laser beam of a single longitudinal mode are more exacting. For example U.S. Patent Application No. 2003 0091300 A1 hereby incorporated by reference discloses a profile for a semiconductor laser device with a single longitudinal mode.

Some laser diodes such as most visible lasers operate at a single wavelength but that wavelength is unstable and changes due to fluctuations in current or temperature. The present invention provides a more stable device that will permit less wavelength drift due to fluctuations in temperature.

Normally a current known as injected current flows into both the nodal and anti nodal regions of the standing optical wave. The direction of current flow is perpendicular to optical cavity axis. The standing optical wave is fed by the population inversion created in the gain or active region by the electrons and holes provided by the injected current. The standing optical wave depletes the inversion in the anti nodal regions in which the optical electric field is at its maximum. The inversion created in the nodal regions however is lost to fluorescence and or supports the creation of competing longitudinal modes thereby resulting in lower efficiency and reduced stability.

Systems and methods for emitting laser radiation are provided. The invention involves the use of current channels or blocking areas strips or layers in a semiconductor laser to channel the injected current into the antinode region of the optical standing wave present in the optical cavity while restricting the current flow to the nodal regions. Normally the injected current flows into both the node or nodal and antinode or antinodal regions of the optical standing wave. The optical standing wave is fed by the population inversion created in the active region by the injected electrons and holes. The standing optical wave depletes the inversion in the antinodal regions where the electric field is at its maximum but the inversion created in the nodal regions is lost to fluorescence or supports the creation of undesirable competing longitudinal modes. This invention increases the efficiency of the device and causes a selected longitudinal mode to preferentially oscillate regardless of where the longitudinal mode lies with respect to the gain curve. In one embodiment of the present invention the semiconductor laser is fabricated with exacting fabrication of the Fabry Perot cavity so that the nodes and antinodes are properly positioned with respect to the current channels vis a vis the current blocking areas strips or segmented layers. There may be on the order of one thousand nodes e.g. 500 1500 produced vis a vis the on the order of one thousand pairs of current blocking areas strips or segmented layer portions so that the nodes and antinodes are properly positioned with respect to the current channels in an embodiment of the present invention. This new method of semiconductor laser is applicable to but not limited to the GaAlAs AlGaInP AlGaAsP and InGaN diode laser material systems. In one embodiment a p type electrode provides an ohmic contact to the p side of the device followed by a p GaAs cap layer that surrounds the p AlGaAs cladding layer. This layer forms part of the optical index waveguide that contains the laser radiation. One primary feature of this embodiment of the present invention is the placement of the n GaAs current blocking layers above the active layer and p GaAs current blocking layer below the active layer which may be strips areas or segmented layers that provide the current channeling. An AlGaAs active layer is where the stimulated recombination takes place. Lowering of the refractive index relative to the active region of the laser produces improved light confinement i.e. restricts laser light to the active region more effectively. A standing optical wave is formed in the space between the ends of the device which act as partially reflecting mirrors. An n AlGaAs cladding layer provides an optical index waveguide with the p side cladding layer. The n GaAs buffer layer provides a transition to the n GaAs substrate. An n type electrode provides the device with an ohmic contact of the n side of the device. Laser radiation is emitted from both ends of the device that act as mirrors but generally the emission from one end is used while the output from the opposite end is used for feedback control of the device. In one embodiment the entire device may be approximately 0.5 mm in length and 0.25 mm in height and width. The current blocking layers are composed of highly doped p type material on the n side and heavily doped n type material on the p side. The choice of blocking material may be varied with materials appropriate to the particular laser materials system being used. The materials used and the thickness of the layers will vary from material system to material system but the current channeling concept can be used in all material systems. This invention has an advantage over presently known devices in that the quantum efficiency will be increased as less current will be wasted as fluorescence. This invention also has the advantage of locking in a single pre chosen longitudinal mode that will remain relatively fixed in wavelength with temperature. This invention fully optimizes the performance of a semiconductor laser producing maximum quantum efficiency. It also solves the problem of wavelength drift with temperature. This invention will be useful in any application where semiconductor lasers are used i.e. CD DVD data storage Diode Pumped Solid State Lasers telecommunications. This invention will be particularly useful for applications where high power efficiency and wavelength stability is at a premium. The following features of this invention are believed to be novel use of current channeling to increase efficiency and the use of current channeling to lock in a single longitudinal mode

An embodiment of a system for emitting laser radiation includes a first cladding layer a second cladding layer a first plurality of strips a second plurality of strips and an active layer. The first plurality of strips have a different level of conductivity than the first cladding layer. The second plurality of strips have a different level of conductivity than the second cladding layer. The active layer is located between the first and second cladding layers and between the first and second pluralities of strips. The active layer is configured to produce an optical wave having a plurality of nodes. Each of the plurality of nodes is located between a corresponding one of the first plurality of strips and a corresponding one of the second plurality of strips. Current channels exist between the strips which are necessarily small and equal to 2n where is the wavelength and n is the refractive index of the active layer. The number of nodes in the device will also be large on the order of 1000. The fabrication of the present invention requires additional patterning steps to produce the channels and requires fabrication of the Fabry Perot cavity so that the nodes and antinodes are properly positioned with respect to the current channels.

An embodiment of a method for emitting laser radiation includes injecting a current into a laser generating an optical wave in the laser and restricting current flow to the nodal regions of the optical wave such that the current is channeled to the non nodal regions of the optical wave.

Systems and methods for emitting laser radiation are provided. In this regard an embodiment of such a system provides current blocking strips or layers in a semiconductor laser to channel the injected current into the anti nodal regions of the standing optical wave generated by the active region of a homogeneously broadened semiconductor laser material. Such an embodiment can potentially increase efficiency and cause a selected longitudinal mode to preferentially oscillate regardless of where the longitudinal mode lies with respect to the gain curve. This results in a more stable system that permits less wavelength drift with temperature.

By way of background photon emitting semiconductor lasers use of a type of semiconductor whose physical and atomic structure confers the possibility for photon emission. These photon emitting semiconductors are the so called direct bandgap semiconductors. The so called compound semiconductors which have virtually the identical crystal structure as silicon or germanium but use alternating arrangements of two different atomic species in a checkerboard like pattern that break the symmetry and in doing so create the critical direct bandgap. Examples of compound semiconductors that are adapted to be used with the present invention are gallium arsenide indium phosphide gallium antimonide gallium nitride and so forth and junction diodes fabricated from these materials emit light.

The current blocking strips and are configured to restrict the current from flowing through areas of the material located between opposing pairs of current blocking strips and . In particular the current blocking strips exhibit lower electrical conductivity i.e. higher resistance than that of the material surrounding the current blocking strips. As a result the current is channeled through gaps located between adjacent current blocking strips and through gaps located between adjacent current blocking strips . This is because Ohm s law dictates that more current will flow along a path of lower resistance than along an alternative path of higher resistance.

In one embodiment the distance between the centers of adjacent gaps and between the centers of adjacent gaps is substantially equal to 2n where n is the refractive index of the active layer and is the wavelength of the standing optical waves that the laser system is configured to create. Similarly the distance between the centers of adjacent current blocking strips and adjacent current blocking strips excluding the narrower current blocking strips and at the ends of the laser system which are included to provide regions for accommodating a node at the end facet of the laser is substantially equal to 2n. This restricts the current from flowing through the nodal regions of the standing optical waves since the nodal regions are located between respective opposing current strips and . The width of each of the gaps and is preferably less than 4n. This enables the current flowing through the active layer to be concentrated in the anti nodal regions of the standing optical waves since the anti nodal regions are located between respective opposing gaps and .

The active layer is located between the cladding layers and as well as between the current blocking strips and . Having the current blocking strips and located closer to the active layer reduces the extent of diffusion of the current in a direction that is perpendicular to its general direction of current flow as the current propagates through the layers of the laser system .

The current blocking strips and are configured to restrict the current from flowing through areas located between opposing pairs of the current blocking strips and . As a result the current is channeled through gaps located between adjacent current blocking strips and through gaps located between adjacent current blocking strips . In one embodiment the width of each of the gaps and is equal or less than 4n whereas the distance between the centers of adjacent gaps and is substantially equal to 2n. For example if n is equal to 3.5 and the oscillation wavelength is from 1100 nm to 1550 nm the width of the gaps or channels will be on the order of 153.14 to 214.285 nm or less.

The gaps or channels will be substantially equal to number of nodal or anti nodal regions in the system and may be relatively large on the order of for example hundreds or thousands of nodes. High precision fabrication of the Fabry Perot cavity helps the current blocking strips and the current channels to be properly positioned with respect to the nodes and anti nodes to facilitate the production of a single longitudinal wave.

An advantage of this embodiment is increased quantum efficiency as less current is wasted through fluorescence. Another advantage is that it enables locking into a single pre chosen longitudinal mode that will experience relatively little shift in wavelength responsive to changes in temperature. The current blocking strips also may act as a distributed feedback DFB structure that causes a preferred longitudinal mode to oscillate. This embodiment may be useful in many applications where semiconductor lasers are used including for example compact disc CD and digital video decoder DVD data storage functionality diode pumped solid state lasers and optics based telecommunications. This embodiment may be particularly useful for applications where high power high efficiency and or wavelength stability is desired.
