title: Battle damage assessment system
abstract: A shock-triggered warhead fragment transmitter is described. The transmitter is designed to radiate a pulse upon either detonation of the warhead or impact of the fragment with the target. The pulse energy is obtained by shock de-poling of a ferroelectric material and is radiated using a dipole antenna. Detection of the radiated pulses may be used to confirm detonation of the warhead and determine the time and location of the detonation and facilitate battle damage assessment.

Throughout history man has sought better weapons and means of conducting war. One important element contributing to successful combat and military success is battlefield intelligence. One element of battlefield intelligence is battle damage assessment BDA which provides information about damage inflicted on a target.

This BDA information is important for determining plans deployment and success of missions and or other objectives. Such objectives may include e.g. whether the target is destroyed whether a weapon is effective whether subsequent missions on the target are required and how many. Conventional methods of BDA have relied on satellites air reconnaissance and field reports to determine the effectiveness of a particular weapon and or mission. However each of these methods has significant drawbacks.

For instance all of these methods rely on obtaining and interpreting visual information to reach a conclusion regarding BDA however complete visual information often is not available for a particular target. For example visual information may be impaired by weather terrain distance the enemy or even the target itself. Visual impairment caused by the target includes e.g. when a warhead penetrates inside a structure. In addition visual information requires human interpretation which is subjective and time intensive. Furthermore there can be significant delay between the time a target is struck and the time the visual information is obtained and interpreted.

In one general aspect a fragment transmitter includes a ferroelectric material and a resonant dipole transmitter in conjunction with the ferroelectric material to transmit at least one pulse upon weapon detonation. The ferroelectric material may provide a power source for the resonant dipole transmitter by de poling when sufficiently shocked.

The ferroelectric material may be formed as a polyhedron. The resonant dipole transmitter also may include two electrodes and a spark gap formed in the ferroelectric material connected between the two electrodes by two wires.

The pulse may be transmitted at a predetermined frequency to identify the transmitter where the predetermined frequency identifies the weapon. The predetermined frequency may be determined by the curvature of the two wires. The ferroelectric material may be Lead Zirconate Titanate.

The ferroelectric material may be formed as a polyhedron have at least two opposing faces in a first and second plane and the two electrodes are formed on the two opposing faces of the polyhedron. The planes may be substantially parallel and the ferroelectric material may be polarized in a direction substantially orthogonal to the planes.

The transmitter may be shock triggered and the ferroelectric material may de pole when the weapon is detonated and or when the transmitter strikes a potential target.

The shock and or compression of the ferroelectric material due to detonation of the weapon causes a de poling process that generates a surface charge upon a phase transformation of the ferroelectric material to power the dipole transmitter. The charge resulting from the de poling is released to generate a rise in voltage between the electrodes.

The spark gap conducts when the voltage between the electrodes exceeds the breakdown voltage of the spark gap and the resulting circuit is substantially equivalent to a capacitor and inductor connected in parallel. The voltage of the circuit oscillates at a frequency determined by the capacitance of the two electrodes and the inductance of the two wires. The two wires act as a dipole antenna causing the oscillations to decay as energy is radiated away.

The shock to the ferroelectric material causes a de poling process resulting in voltage oscillations V over time of the form cos where

The transmitter may further include a buffer material to protect the resonant dipole transmitter upon detonation of the weapon.

In another general aspect a battle damage assessment BDA system includes a weapon including one or more fragment transmitters to radiate a pulse upon detonation of the weapon an antenna platform to receive the pulse and a processor to provide BDA based on the received pulse.

The BDA may include at least one of confirmation of weapon detonation time of detonation and location of the detonation. Other features will be apparent from the description the drawings and the claims.

The following describes how pulse emission from ferroelectric fragments may be generated upon detonation of a warhead. The pulses may be detected by an antenna and used in battle damage assessment BDA . Example antennas include e.g. satellite air sea or ground based antennas. Exemplary BDA includes e.g. to confirm detonation of the warhead time of detonation target impact and damage to the target. The fragment transmitters and BDA system are described in further detail below.

As shown in a BDA system uses warhead fragment transmitters that are included in a warhead or other projectile weapon . The fragment transmitter radiates a first pulse upon detonation of the warhead and second pulse on impact of the fragment transmitter with the target . The pulse energy is provided by shock de poling of the ferroelectric material in the fragment transmitter and is radiated using a dipole antenna.

The pulses are received by one or more antenna platforms and transmitted as pulse data via a communications link to a base system to be processed. The pulse data may be used to generate BDA data and reports. For example detection of the radiated pulses can be used to confirm detonation of the warhead determine the time and location of the detonation and facilitate BDA of the target .

A resonant dipole transmitter may be connected between the electrodes . The ferroelectric material is de poled when a shock wave passes through the material for example from detonation of the weapon. As a result of the de poling a charge is released to generate a rise in voltage between the electrodes .

The resonant dipole fragment transmitter includes a spark gap connected between the electrodes by two wires . In one implementation the wires connecting the spark gap to the electrodes may be configured in a curved path or non straight path e.g. in either two or three dimensions to increase their inductance.

The spark gap conducts when the voltage between the electrodes exceeds the breakdown voltage of the spark gap . The resulting circuit is substantially equivalent neglecting radiation and loss resistances to a capacitor and inductor connected in parallel. The circuit oscillates at a frequency determined by the capacitance of the electrodes and the inductance of the wires. Furthermore the wires act as a dipole antenna causing the oscillations to decay as energy is radiated away.

The fragment transmitter releases this energy when exposed to pressures high enough to de pole the ferroelectric material such as the pressures generated by warhead detonation. Detonation of the warhead de poles the fragment transmitter but does not destroy it.

The fragment transmitter also sends a pulse upon impact with the target. Buffering materials such as for example polymeric material may be used with the fragment transmitters to reduce the level of shock experienced by the fragment transmitter upon detonation of the warhead. An exemplary polymeric material would be Teflon.

For these relations L is the inductance of the wires C is the capacitance of the electrodes and R is the sum of Rand R. The term Ris the effective radiation resistance of the antenna and Rincludes all other resistances in the circuit. The current oscillates out of phase with the voltage. Energy is transferred between the capacitance and inductance of the circuit while being dissipated by the total resistance R of the circuit. The manner in which the oscillations are initiated is described in further detail below.

The transmitting frequency of the fragment transmitter may be controlled by adjusting the amount of curvature in the wires and thereby changing in the inductance L. In this way each warhead or a group of warheads may be given a signature frequency that may be used to identify or correlate BDA with a particular weapon.

This implementation is relatively straightforward although there are several conditions that may effect efficient transmission of the fragment transmitter . For example the resistance of the wires should be minimized. In one implementation resistance is kept as small as possible because electrical energy dissipated in the wiring resistance is wasted. Loss resistances Rshould be smaller than the radiation resistance Rof the antenna. However this configuration may limit the range of frequencies that are used. Optimal efficiency may be achieved for an antenna length that is on the order of one wavelength of the radiated pulse.

Because the fragment transmitter is relatively small this condition may be difficult to meet. Therefore in one implementation it is advantageous to keep the transmitting frequency as high as possible. For example frequencies of approximately 1 GHz provide suitable efficiencies for a 1 inch 1 cube fragment. Of course other fragment sizes and frequencies are possible and may be chosen based on a specific transmitter s adaptation to a particular application.

Oscillations are initiated when the fragment is exposed to a shock wave for example from impact or weapon detonation. shows one example of oscillation as a voltage versus time curve . The shock wave de poles the ferroelectric material as it passes through the material and releases a charge.

The charge causes the voltage between the electrodes to increase in a nearly linear manner. When the voltage between the electrodes exceeds a certain value the spark gap conducts and the resulting equivalent circuit described above occurs and the voltage oscillations commence.

Several aspects of the spark gap may contribute to overall effectiveness of the fragment transmitter . For example the breakdown voltage of the spark gap should be lower than the breakdown voltage of the ferroelectric material. In addition the on state resistance of the spark gap should be minimized.

The dynamic characteristics of the spark gap also are relevant. For example the spark gap should turn on quickly enough to prevent the breakdown voltage of the ferroelectric material from being exceeded and remain on until the oscillations have completed. The second condition may be easily achieved since most spark gaps have recovery times on the order of milliseconds and the pulse emission is completed within a few microseconds because the transmitter is quickly destroyed .

There are a number of factors that influence the choice of which ferroelectric material that is used in the fragment transmitter . For example the available energy and the material strength of the ferroelectric material are important. The material strength determines whether or not the fragment transmitter survives warhead detonation. For example a strength of greater than 0.5 kbar may be used.

The available energy limits the range of the transmitted pulse. The available energy is dependent on the maximum remnant polarization and the dielectric strength of the ferroelectric material . Assuming isotropic radiation the pulse energy E must satisfy

The noise temperature depends on many factors but in many instances it is approximately 300K. De poling of a ferroelectric material provides about 1 J cm which is sufficient to produce a pulse that may be detected thousands of miles away. The primary advantage of using a ferroelectric power supply is the fact that the energy is made available very quickly e.g. within microseconds .

In one implementation Lead Zirconate Titanate PZT may be used as the ferroelectric material to implement the fragment transmitter . PZT is a ferroelectric ceramic material that produces a large single pulse emission in a few microseconds up to a megawatt when sufficiently shocked.

The electrical response to the shock and or compression is due to a de poling process which generates a surface charge upon a phase transformation of the ferroelectric material as described above. In one example PZT 56 44 and PZT 95 5 under shock impact generate electrical pulses up to 1 Megawatt. Pulse durations are on the order of microseconds.

The fragment transmitters may be interspersed to provide even distribution or concentrated within a desired area of the weapon. In addition different sizes of fragment transmitters may be used within the same weapon. The fragment transmitters may be placed in the fuse well of the warhead however other configurations are possible. In addition the fragment transmitters may be buffered to prevent or minimize damage during detonation. Specific frequencies may be chosen for the weapon to identify the weapon after deployment.

In another implementation as shown in the fragment transmitters may be retrofit to existing weapons . As shown the fragment transmitters may be retrofit using a wrap . The wrap may be implemented using a mat that includes fragment transmitters that are attached around the exterior of the warhead .

Similarly a patch not shown also may be used. In another implementation a sleeve including fragment transmitters may be retrofit over the exterior of the warhead . The wrap patch or sleeve may be attached to the warhead using an adhesive or through a mechanical fastening mechanism.

Land air sea and space based antenna platforms receive the pulse transmissions at a predetermined frequency based on the fragment transmitters and for example the inductance of the wires chosen for the dipole antennas. Such antenna platforms include e.g. a field unit a ground vehicle an aircraft a naval vessel and a space vehicle.

The pulse transmissions are received by the antenna platform and may be filtered and converted to digital data. The data may be transmitted via a communications link to a command center base or post . The digital data may be stored in a memory device and provided to a processing device for example at the base or command post . The processing device may be programmed to interpret the weapon data and prepare a BDA report based on the data received.

The pulse data may be processed to determine both phase and phase information about the weapon and the target. For example the pulse data may be used to determine if the warhead properly detonated the time of detonation the coordinates or place of detonation and damage to the target. This information may be used for many purposes such as evaluating the efficiency of the weapon its suitability for the target if further missions are needed to destroy the target and how many.

In addition the information may be used for fire support for example to correct and or adjust fire missions. Because the data are precise and collected quickly and accurately BDA quality and turnaround times may be greatly increased over conventional methods. BDA also may be provided even though there is no line of sight of visual observation of the target. Furthermore the BDA system is not impaired by weather or other obstructions such as e.g. time on target.

A number of exemplary implementations have been described. Nevertheless it will be understood that various modifications may be made. For example the design of a fragment transmitter involves many tradeoffs and any number of different designs are possible consistent with the description above. For example suitable results may be achieved if components in a described component system architecture or devices are combined in a different manner and or replaced or supplemented by other components. Accordingly other implementations are within the scope of the following claims.
