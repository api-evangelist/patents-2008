The application launching program shown in is a program for controlling the launch of the content reproducing software in response to a notification from the coordination unit . A description of processing executed by the CPU in accordance with the application launching program is given below with reference to .

The coordination unit shown in stores a code group list and a pre processing program in the EEPROM not shown . The code group list is a list of a code group contained in one of the multiple records in the code group master table shown in . The pre processing program is a program for storing the code group list in the coordination unit in cooperation with the pre processing program see in the coordination aiding software . When the plug is disconnected from the HDMI output terminal the code group list is deleted from the EEPROM not shown in the coordination unit .

The coordination unit shown in also stores a coordination program in the EEPROM not shown . When the HDMI output terminal is connected to an HDMI input terminal the HDMI input terminal in the present embodiment of an external input apparatus the coordination program monitors an operation performed on the external input apparatus on the basis of the CEC information unilaterally output from the external input apparatus. Also when a predetermined operation is performed on the external input apparatus the coordination program performs processing corresponding to the operation. A description of processing executed by the CPU in accordance with the coordination program is described below with reference to .

A description of processing performed by the main unit and the coordination unit in the content reproduction management apparatus and the television apparatus will be described below.

The pre processing is processing performed when the main unit and the television apparatus are interconnected through the HDMI cable. When the main unit is powered on the CPU is adapted to launch the pre processing program to start the pre processing. When the main unit is in the power on state step S after the start of the pre processing the CPU stands by N in step S until it receives a notification indicating the detection of a plug connection from the HDMI transmitter .

Upon receiving the notification indicating the detection of a plug connection from the HDMI transmitter Y in step S the CPU issues a request for the vender ID held by the HDMI connected external input apparatus to the coordination unit in step S and then stands by N in step S until the CPU receives the vender ID from the coordination unit .

On the other hand when the power is turned on the CPU not shown in the coordination unit is also adapted to launch the pre processing program to start the pre processing. In the power on state step S after starting the pre processing when the coordination unit specifically the CPU not shown therein receives the request for the vender ID held by the HDMI connected external input apparatus from the CPU in step S the coordination unit specifically the CPU not shown therein transfers the request to the controller in the television apparatus through an HDMI interface i.e. the HDMI transmitter the HDMI cable and the HDMI receiver in a format according to the CEC standard.

In the power on state step S the controller in the television apparatus transmits the vender ID held thereby to the coordination unit through the HDMI interface in accordance with the CEC standard step S . Upon receiving the vender ID from the controller the coordination unit transfers the vender ID to the CPU in step S.

Upon receiving the vender ID from the coordination unit the CPU in the main unit uses the vender ID as a search condition to search the code group master table shown in and detects one of the records therein to identify a code group in step S.

Thereafter in step S the CPU transmits the identified code group to the coordination unit . Upon receiving the code group from the CPU in step S the coordination unit stores the code group in the EEPROM not shown as the code group list

As described above when the pre processing programs and are running on the main unit and the coordination unit respectively the HDMI transmitter detects a plug connection and then the group of codes used by the remote controller and the television apparatus connected to the HDMI transmitter is set in the coordination unit . Consequently the coordination unit can identify an operation performed on the television apparatus on the basis of the button code unilaterally output from the television apparatus as the CEC information.

Before the sequence shown in is executed the main unit and the coordination unit in the content reproduction management apparatus complete the above described pre processing shown in and the code group list is already stored in the coordination unit . Further the main unit is in the power off state or in the standby state and the television apparatus is in the standby state. The coordination program in the coordination unit is already launched by the CPU not shown to start coordination processing.

When the operator presses a power state switching button the so called power button not shown on the remote controller to cause an operation signal indicating switching to the power on state to be input from the remote controller to the television apparatus the controller in the television apparatus performs handshake processing the contents of which correspond to the switching to the power on state with the coordination unit through the HDMI interface.

The contents e.g. a command flow determined from a combination and a sequence of commands of the handshake processing vary for each vender Thus after the coordination processing is started in step S the coordination unit specifically the CPU not shown therein monitors commands that are sequentially inputted through the HDMI interface. Upon detecting a command flow corresponding to the switching to the power on state Y in step S the process proceeds to step S. In step S the coordination unit stores in the memory not shown television operation information indicating the operation of powering on the television apparatus . The content reproduction management apparatus receives a command indicating a power on operation of the television apparatus while the television apparatus is connected to the content reproduction management apparatus .

The coordination unit specifically the CPU not shown therein which executes steps S and S and the HDMI transmitter correspond to a detecting section.

Subsequently in step S the coordination unit reads the simultaneous launch setting information from the memory not shown . In step S the coordination unit determines whether or not the simultaneous launch setting information indicates that the above described simultaneous launch function is to be enabled. When the simultaneous launch setting information does not indicate that the simultaneous launch function is to be enabled N in step S the coordination unit does not perform any processing and returns to step S in which it monitors commands that are sequentially input through the HDMI interface.

On the other hand when the simultaneous launch setting information indicates that the simultaneous launch function is to be enabled Y in step S the coordination unit makes a determination in step S as to whether or not the main unit is in the power on state. When the main unit is in the power off state or in the standby state N in step S the coordination unit issues a power on instruction to the CPU in the main unit in step S and stands by N in step S until it receives a request for television operation information.

On the other hand when the main unit is in the power off state or in the standby state and receives the power on instruction from the coordination unit the CPU turns on the internal hardware including the CPU . Thereafter the CPU launches the operating system software and the application launching program see to start application launch processing.

After starting the application launch processing in step S the CPU issues a request for the television operation information stored in the coordination unit and stands by N in step S until the CPU receives the television operation information.

Upon receiving the request for the television operation information Y in step S the coordination unit transmits the television operation information stored in the memory not shown to the CPU in step S. When the CPU receives the television operation information Y in step S the process proceeds to step S. In step S the CPU uses the television operation information as a search condition to search the assignment definition table shown in and reads the names of the content reproducing software from the application name fields in detected records to identify the content reproducing software to be launched. The television operation information received from the coordination unit and stored in the memory not shown in step S is information that indicates the operation of powering on the television apparatus as described above and thus the CPU identifies the application software which is Jukebox in that automatically reproduces content after the launch thereof.

Thereafter in step S the CPU launches the identified content reproducing software . In response the CPU passes predetermined content data to the signal processing unit in accordance with the content reproducing software generates audio video signals based on the content data and outputs the audio video signals to the television apparatus through the HDMI interface. The content reproduction management apparatus executes a software program upon confirmation of the command indicating the power on operation of the television apparatus in reference to the command code information and outputs image data produced by the software program to the television apparatus so as to display an image corresponding to the image data on the display panel

The coordination unit specifically the CPU not shown therein which executes steps S to S and the CPU which executes steps S to S correspond to a launching section. The signal processing unit and the HDMI transmitter correspond to an outputting section.

When the simultaneous launch setting information indicates that the simultaneous launch function is to be enabled Y in step S and the main unit is in the power on state Y in step S the coordination unit immediately transmits the television operation information stored in the memory not shown to the CPU in step S without performing the startup processing steps S and S for the main unit . When the main unit is in the power on state the CPU is in a state in which it has already started the application launch processing and stands by N in step S until it receives the television operation information. Thus upon detecting that an operation of powering on the television apparatus is performed the coordination unit may immediately transmits the television operation information to the CPU . Even when the CPU receives the television operation information in such a manner in step S it identifies the content reproducing software to be launched on the basis of the assignment definition table shown in and launches the identified content reproducing software in step S.

As described above the application launching program and the coordination program are executed by the main unit and the coordination unit respectively. Thus in a case in which the operation of powering on the television apparatus is performed through the operation of the power state switching button on the remote controller when the main unit is in the power off state or in the standby state the main unit is switched into the power on state and then the content reproducing software is launched to cause audio video signals to be output to the television apparatus and on the other hand when the main unit is in the power on state the content reproducing software is immediately launched to cause audio video signals to be output to the television apparatus .

Before the sequence shown in is executed the main unit and the coordination unit in the content reproduction management apparatus complete the above described processing shown in the content reproducing software in the main unit is already started and the television apparatus is in the power on state. Also the processing performed by the application launching program and the processing performed by the coordination program are continued.

When the operator presses the input switching button not shown on the remote controller e.g. presses the numeric button 9 on the remote controller in the example shown in to cause an operation signal indicating switching to the input route passing through the HDMI receiver to be input from the remote controller to the television apparatus the controller in the television apparatus unilaterally outputs through the HDMI interface a button code indicating the switching to the input route passing through the HDMI receiver . The controller then controls the selector see in the signal processor to couple the HDMI receiver with the signal processing unit . In response based on audio video signals output from the content reproduction management apparatus content that is being reproduced by the content reproduction management apparatus is output from the display panel and the speakers

In addition when the operator presses of the buttons on the remote controller a button for outputting CEC information for requesting for Root Menu defined in the CEC standard an operation signal indicating the Root Menu request is input from the remote controller to the television apparatus .

In step S the coordination unit specifically the CPU not shown therein monitors commands that are sequentially input through the HDMI interface. When the coordination unit detects both an operation of switching to the input route passing through the HDMI receiver and an operation of outputting the CEC information indicating the Root Menu request Y in step S the process proceeds to step S. In step S the coordination unit stores in the memory not shown television operation information indicating calling of another application.

Subsequently in step S the coordination unit transmits the television operation information stored in the memory not shown to the CPU . On the other hand the CPU stands by in step S until it receives the television operation information. When the CPU receives the television operation information Y in step S the process proceeds to step S. In step S the CPU uses the television operation information as a search condition to search the assignment definition table shown in and reads the names of the content reproducing software from the application name fields of detected records to identify the content reproducing software to be launched. In this case since the television operation information received from the coordination unit and stored in the CPU not shown in step S indicates the Root Menu request the CPU identifies the content reproducing software which is Video Player in the example of that is different from the application software which is Jukebox in that automatically reproduces content after the launch thereof.

Thereafter in step S the CPU launches the identified content reproducing software . At this point therefore two pieces of content reproducing software are running on the main unit in parallel. On the desktop however a window assigned to the subsequently launched content reproducing software becomes active and audio video signals associated with the previously launched content reproducing software are not output from the signal processing unit .

In addition when the operator presses an arrow button or an enter button on the remote controller a button code corresponding to the pressed button is output from the remote controller to the coordination unit through the HDMI interface. On the basis of the code grope list the coordination unit identifies the button operated on the remote controller and issues a notification indicating operation information corresponding to the identified button to the CPU . On the basis of the operation information the CPU operates the content reproducing software having the active window. In this manner using the remote controller the operator can operate the content reproducing software on the content reproduction management apparatus and can view listen to on the television apparatus arbitrary content data by selecting and reproducing the content data

Thereafter when the operator presses an arbitrary button on the remote controller to cause an operation signal indicating switching to an input route other than the input route passing through the HDMI receiver to be input from the remote controller to the television apparatus the controller in the television apparatus unilaterally outputs through the HDMI interface a button code indicating the switching to the specified input route i.e. the input route other than the input route passing through the HDMI receiver . The controller then controls the selector see in the signal processor to couple the specified input route to the signal processing unit . In response on the basis of audio video signals input through the specified input route content is output from the display panel and the speakers . That is in the television apparatus input switching is performed and display is switched to content e.g. content of ground wave analog television broadcast other than the content reproduced by the content reproduction management apparatus .

In step S when the operation signal indicating the input switching is input from the controller in the television apparatus the coordination unit passes operation information indicating the input switching to the CPU .

In step S in the CPU launches the content reproducing software in response to the switching to the input route passing through the HDMI receiver . Thereafter in step S the CPU monitors a further notification indicating input switching. Upon receiving from the coordination unit a notification indicating switching to an input route other than the input route passing through the HDMI receiver Y in step S the process proceeds to step S in which the CPU determines that multiple pieces of content reproducing software are running in parallel. When multiple pieces of content reproducing software are not running in parallel the CPU does not perform any processing and returns to the state in which it stands by N in step S until it receives television operation information from the coordination unit .

On the other hand when multiple pieces of content reproducing software are running in parallel the CPU causes a window assigned to the content reproducing software the default content reproducing software launched upon power on of the television apparatus to become active in step S. Thereafter the CPU returns to the state in which it stands by N in step S until television operation information is received from the coordination unit .

As described above the application launching program and the coordination program are executed by the main unit and the coordination unit respectively. Thus when the HDMI receiver is selected as the input route for the selector in the television apparatus through an operation of the input switching button on the remote controller content reproduced by the content reproduction management apparatus can be viewed listened to using the television apparatus .
