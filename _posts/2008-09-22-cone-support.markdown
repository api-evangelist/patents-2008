title: Cone support
abstract: A cone support for use with a stud, the cone support includes a hollow truncated cone with an apex and a base. The hollow truncated cone includes an apex aperture disposed at the apex and a base aperture disposed at the base. The apex aperture has a threaded internal diameter. The apex aperture and base aperture communicate within a cone chamber, the cone chamber is disposed within the interior of the cone and between the apex aperture and the base aperture. The stud is placeable within the apex aperture, the cone chamber and the base aperture such that the cone support protects the stud from shear forces when the stud is stressed perpendicular to its axis.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Governmental of the United States of America for government purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefor. The technology described herein was a subject invention under contract No. N00421 03 P 0049 with Foster Miller Inc.

The present invention relates to a cone support. More specifically but without limitation the present invention relates to a cone support for protecting a stud particularly a bonded stud from shear forces when the stud is stressed perpendicular to its axis.

Prior to the present invention threaded studs with a flanged base plate were used to fasten items to a surface via bonding the flanged plate. The flanged studs failed in sided load through shear or fatigue over time.

The present invention is directed to a cone support for use with a stud the cone support includes a hollow truncated cone with an apex and a base. The hollow truncated cone includes an apex aperture disposed at the apex and a base aperture disposed at the base. The apex aperture has a threaded internal diameter. The apex aperture and base aperture communicate with a cone chamber the cone chamber is disposed within the interior of the cone and between the apex aperture and the aperture. The stud is placeable within the apex aperture the cone chamber and the base aperture such that the cone support protects the stud from shear forces when the stud is stressed perpendicular to its axis.

It is a feature of the present invention to provide a cone support that adds strength but minimal weight to a system.

The preferred embodiment of the present invention are illustrated by way of example below and in . The cone support includes a hollow truncated cone with a flattened apex and a base . A flattened apex may be defined as the top of a frustum or the top area left when an apex of a typical cone is cut at a parallel plane to the base. The hollow truncated cone includes an apex aperture disposed at the flattened apex and a base aperture disposed at the base . The apex aperture has a threaded internal diameter . The apex aperture and the base aperture communicate with a cone chamber the cone chamber is disposed within the interior of the cone and between the apex aperture and the base aperture . A stud is placeable within the apex aperture the cone chamber and the base aperture such that the cone support protects the stud from shear forces when the stud is stressed perpendicular to its axis .

In the description of the present invention the invention will be discussed in an avionic or aeronautics environment however this invention can be utilized for any type of need that requires use of a cone support.

As shown in the base aperture is larger than the apex aperture . In use the base of the cone support is in contact with a stud flange . The walls of the cone may be thin and the cone may be manufactured from metal plastic composite or any type of material practicable.

The cone size and wall thickness can be scaled to suit expected loads. The cone support is used with a threaded stud with a flared base embedded within a tapered composite base. The bottom of the base of the stud is flat and placed against the part. The bottom of the base of the stud is bonded to the part. In operation the cone support is threaded to the stud via the threaded internal diameter and may be bonded to the flared base of the stud via the base .

When introducing elements of the present invention or the preferred embodiment s thereof the articles a an the and said are intended to mean there are one or more of the elements. The terms comprising including and having are intended to be inclusive and mean that there may be additional elements other than the listed elements.

Although the present invention has been described in considerable detail with reference to a certain preferred embodiment thereof other embodiments are possible. Therefore the spirit and scope of the appended claims should not be limited to the description of the preferred embodiment s contained herein.
