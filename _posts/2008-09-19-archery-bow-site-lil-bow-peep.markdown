The manufacturing of this bow sight requires a blank piece of stock measuring in By 2 in by 12 in. Can also be injection moulded.

The layout of holes for weight reduction can be of any configuration but not in any manner which would destroy the integrity of stock. Important hole layout will be the main elongated hole for elevation adjustments. This elongated hole along with the peep relocation are mainstays of Invention. See blueprint for more details.

Starting on the peep end of site and following along the centerline of apparatus main frame will be 1M. In height and continue toward front end for a distance of 2 in. At this point you start an increase in height of main frame for a distance of mainframe for a distance of 2 in. At this point main frame is 1 in tall equal on both sides. See blueprint . Main frame reduces at this point to 1 in. Total length of main frame will be 12 in. The end of frame will have the pin holding device mounted in a clamping arrangement of a in hole open on the end and a 5 16 hole with relief cut between holes. A 6 32 socket screw will provide tension for clamping the pin holder in frame. This archery sight main frame will facilitate several variations of bow sight pins. The peep end of frame is of such that a fixed peep or an adjustable one can be utilized. The fixed peep for this frame is manufactured using a SS 8 32 socket head bolt and 8 32 locking nut with a gnarled peep lock. The peep is manufactured using a section of stock and shaping the peep per drawing. See blueprints.

The adjustable peep is manufactured by making an eccentric shaped piece in by in. Attached to a lever thru main frame via a locking nut set and secured in frame. The adjustable elevation lever is located on rear half of main frame assembly. A hole is drilled in end of bar in from end and peep assembly is mounted thru this mounting hole. Rear of frame has marker for designated ranges. Third element of invention. The elevation location pin is located in end of lever and pointed for accuracy in setting for individual shooting habits and bow strength. To be determined when zeroing bow.
