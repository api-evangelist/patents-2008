title: Category-based name schemes in parsing frameworks
abstract: According to some embodiments, categories and an associated category graph may be determined for a parsing framework. Moreover, a type for the parsing framework may be defined, wherein at least one category is automatically created and inserted into the category graph for an implementation element of the defined type. Namespaces may be automatically defined for the categories based at least in part on inheritance relationships associated with the categories in the category graph.
