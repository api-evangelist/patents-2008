This application claims the benefit of the filing date under 35 USC 119 e of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60 909 505 filed 2 Apr. 2007 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The invention described herein was made in part with government support under grant number FA9550 06 01 0442 awarded by the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research and grant DMR 0526604 and IIP 0638253 awarded by the National Science Foundation. The United States Government has certain rights in the invention.

The present application relates generally to the fields of chemistry optoelectronics silicon germanium alloys semiconductor structures and related methods and devices.

Heteroepitaxial GeSilayers on Si 100 with high Ge contents are of interest due to many applications in key technologies such as solar cells MEMS quantum cascade lasers and Si based photonics see Mooney P. M. Chu J. O. 2000 30 335 and Tromp R. M. Ross F. M. 2000 30 431 including high speed modulators and photodetectors see Kuo et al. 2005 437 1334 . However these materials are much less developed in spite of this high impact potential in IR optical devices. In addition they serve as virtual substrates for growth of high mobility strained Si and Ge device channels and are also considered as a potential pathway to monolithic integration of III V based devices with Si technologies Lee et al. 2004 B 22 1 158 and Kasper E. Heim S. 2004 224 3 . The best current route to these materials is complicated and fraught with difficulties requiring both high temperature growth of thick 10 m compositionally graded films and a chemical mechanical planarization step to relieve the misfit strain between the GeSiepilayer and Si substrate and produce a flat surface respectively see Currie et al. 1998 72 14 1718 .

Chemical vapor deposition CVD methods that allow growth of Ge rich Ge 50 atom device quality alloys on Si that cannot be obtained by conventional routes have been recently developed see Ritter et al. 2005 127 27 9855 9864 Hu et al. 2005 87 18 181903 1 3 and Chizmeshya et al. 2006 128 21 6919 6930 . Ge rich films can enable higher speeds in microprocessors lower power consumption in cell phones silicon based photonics and more efficient solar cells see Mooney and Chu supra and Tromp and Ross supra . The technology utilizes previously unknown designer Si Ge hydride precursors to precisely control the chemical composition morphology and microstructure of the corresponding films circumventing the need for thick graded layers and lift off techniques see Currie et al. supra .

To prepare such semiconductor structures SiGealloys can be deposited selectively in for example the source and drain regions of a transistor architecture. Conventional selective growth of SiGealloys is achieved using high temperature reactions of chlorosilanes germane and elemental Clwhich typically do not yield films with suitable morphology and microstructure in the high Ge concentration range. For example selective growth of SiGealloys has been achieved using high temperature reactions of chlorosilanes germane and elemental Cl. However the complexity of the associated multicomponent reactions and the presence of corrosive Clcall for alternative approaches to selective growth. This need is particularly acute in the high Ge concentration range for which the chlorosilane route does not yield selectively deposited films with suitable morphology microstructure or composition. Furthermore for high Ge content the conventional processes lead to high dislocation densities non uniformities in strain lack of compositional control and reduced film thickness all of which ultimately can degrade the quality and performance of the stressor material thereby limiting the practical usefulness of this approach.

Therefore there exists a need in the art for methods for the deposition of SiGematerials methods for the selective deposition of SiGematerials and in particular high Ge content SiGematerials on substrates which avoid the issues described above.

The invention provides methods for the preparation of compounds of the molecular formula SiGeHX wherein X is halogen and x y z and a are defined herein.

The invention further provides compounds of the molecular formula SiGeHX wherein X is halogen and x y z and a are defined herein.

The invention provides the substantially pure compounds prepared according to the methods of the invention.

The invention also provides methods for the preparation of semiconductor structures through the deposition of high Ge content SiGefilms on substrates using the compounds of the invention.

The invention also provides methods for the selective deposition of a SiGelayer comprising contacting a substrate having a surface layer comprising at least two portions wherein a first portion of the surface layer comprises a semiconductor surface layer and a second portion of the surface layer comprises an oxide nitride or oxynitride surface layer wherein the SiGelayer is formed only on the first portion of the substrate.

The key building blocks of the new technology are the entire halo germyl silane sequence of molecules SiGeHX where X is a halogen and the remaining variables are defined herein which are obtained in viable high purity yields via synthetic methodologies described herein. The inherent incorporation of the SiGemolecular core into the films provides unprecedented control of morphology composition and strain. Work in this area addresses a critical need for precursors and processes that deposit such films under low temperature CMOS compatible conditions with throughput rates that are significantly higher than those offered by existing processes.

Replacing some or all of the H atoms on the silicon atoms of a SiGeH species with halogens provide several desirable benefits such as built in HX leaving groups that can function as cleaning agents for removal of impurities from the growth surface in situ during growth of the desired films. They can also promote selective growth of a variety of device structures strained Si SiGe and strained Ge on patterned Si wafers. In general selective growth of SiGefilms on Si surfaces with SiOpatterned features can be achieved during growth by generation of in situ etchants such as HCl and promote selective growth of crystalline material on the unmasked areas around the patterned regions on the wafer. The larger mass of the halo germyl silanes provides an increased kinetic stability allowing growth to be conducted at even lower temperatures than with SiGehydrides for example HSiGeH.

In a first aspect the invention provides a method for the preparation of compounds of the molecular Formula I SiGeHX I wherein x is 1 2 3 or 4 y is 1 2 3 or 4 z is 2 x y 1 a is 1 to 3x and X is halogen provided that i each X is bonded only to Si and ii the sum of x and y is less than or equal to 5 comprising the step of treating a compound of the molecular Formula II SiGeH II with a compound of the formula BX AlX or a metal chlorinating agent at a temperature of about 80 C. to about 25 C. such a method is referred to hereafter as Method A.

As demonstrated herein compounds according to Formula I can be used for example in controlled depositions to produce stoichiometric SiGefilms possessing desired properties for semiconductor applications including perfectly crystalline and epitaxial microstructures smooth morphologies and uniformly strain relaxed states. The compounds of Formula I are herein demonstrated to be remarkably stable over extended periods of time and thus represent viable molecular sources for potential industrial applications.

Controlled depositions have also produced stoichiometric SiGefilms reflecting the Si Ge content of the precursor and possessing perfectly crystalline and epitaxial microstructures smooth morphologies and fully strained states.

In a further preferred embodiment the semiconductor substrates of this second aspect have an SiGelayer comprising an SiGefilm having a density of threading defects of 10 cmor less.

These embodiments are especially preferred for semiconductor substrates used as active devices. Inclusion of such dopants into the semiconductor substrates can be carried out by standard methods in the art.

In a further embodiment the semiconductor structure may further comprise varying quantities if carbon or tin as desired for a given application. Inclusion of carbon or tin into the semiconductor substrates can be carried out by standard methods in the art.

In a ninth aspect the invention provides a chemical vapor comprising one or more compounds according to any of Formulas I XXIV and a second gas. Such second gases include but are not limited to H He N argon and mixtures thereof preferably the second gas comprises H. Preferred embodiments are as described above.

By using the compounds of any of Formulas I XXIV as precursors for preparing semiconductor substrates the semiconductor substrate will comprise an Si Ge layer comprising or consisting of a backbone of the compounds of the invention. By using the compounds of the invention as opposed to the separate use of Si and Ge sources for deposition the resulting Si Ge layer comprises highly defined and uniform bonding arrangements and strain compensated Si Ge atomic patterns as opposed to the random nature of prior Si Ge films in which the Si and Ge atoms can exist as an intimate mixture of several or multi atom Si and Ge clusters leading to inhomogeneous bonding and locally stressed configurations. In mismatched heteroepitaxy applications these materials exhibit copious dislocations at levels unacceptable for most device applications strain non uniformities and high surface roughness. A distinct and important advantage of our compounds films and methods over conventional ones is that the incorporation of the entire Si Ge molecular core promotes the formation of exceptionally uniform bonding arrangements over the entire crystal leading to relaxed or uniformly stressed films with planar surface morphology no surface ripples . A crucial advantage is the unprecedented low growth temperatures which reduce surface mobility of the Si and Ge atoms and prevent mass segregation thereby resulting in highly uniform compositional and strain profiles at the atomic level.

The intact incorporation of the massive Si Ge cores into the film also leads to low surface diffusion and high sticking coefficients compared to the conventional low mass compounds. The high reactivity promotes high growth rates which increase systematically with the mass of the precursors

Furthermore the incorporation of the entire Si Ge framework of the chemical vapor into the lattice is particularly important in the formations of SiGenanoscale systems quantum dots and wires because it allows precise control of morphology tunable composition and structure that cannot be accomplished by vapor deposition of separate silanes and germanes or by molecular beam epitaxy of solid Si and Ge sources. The precise control of composition and corresponding morphology both of which ultimately determine the physical properties of these nanoscale materials is a crucial issue. Any compositional variations that exist within and among individual nanostructures will have a significant impact on the optical and electronic properties and on the performance of devices. In the MBE case an average concentration is assigned on the basis of the flux ratio utilized to grow the materials. In the CVD approach the local stoichiometry on the scale of the nanostructure size is even less certain because reactions of various molecular sources cannot be simultaneously controlled at every site throughout the sample. Thus neither technique can guarantee systematic growth of Si Ge nanoscale structures with controllable composition strain and size.

Such highly defined patterns can be determined using standard methods in the art such as neutron diffraction.

 a Synthetic routes to ClHSi GeH 1 and ClSi GeH 2 The monochlorinated species 1 was generated by direct combination of BCland SiH GeH in a 1 3 molar proportion via evolution of diborane according to Eq 1. BCl 3SiH GeH BH 3ClHSi GeH 1 The target compound 1 was isolated by trap to trap fractionation as a colorless pyrophoric liquid with a room temperature vapor pressure of 14 Torr. A typical reaction was allowed to proceed at 0 C. for 2 hours and produced pure single phase material in significant yields 40 based on the amount of the starting hydride material used. The latter was recovered under these optimum conditions and was recycled in subsequent preparations. Attempts to increase the yield by extending the reaction time generated mixtures of monochloro compound 1 with minor amounts of the di substituted derivative ClSi GeH 2 . To enhance formation of 2 we increased the Cl activity in the reaction medium by using higher molar ratios of BCland SiH GeH . For a stoichiometric 2 3 combination of the reactants as described by Eq 2 we obtained a mixture of 1 and 2 in yields of 20 and 15 respectively indicating a significant increase of the second chlorination at the Si center as expected. 2BCl 3SiH GeH BH 3ClSi GeH 2 When the chlorine activity was further increased by combining the reactants in 1 1 molar ratio the ClSi GeH 2 species was predominately produced 20 yield while the formation of ClHSi GeH 1 was essentially suppressed 1 yield . In both cases copious amounts of diborane byproducts were evolved in addition to a polymeric solid which was present in quantities insufficient for a reliable characterization. Pure compound 2 was then isolated as a volatile vapor pressure of 7 Torr at 22 C. colorless liquid by trap to trap distillation.

 b Synthetic routes to ClSi GeH 3 The preparation of compound 3 was initially explored by stoichiometric 3 1 combinations of SiH GeH and BCl. These typically produced mixtures of the ClSi GeH and SiH GeH compounds which were impossible to separate due to the similarity in their boiling points. Prolonged reaction times eventually led to the formation of nonvolatile polymeric solids which are likely derived from the decomposition of polychlorinated trisilylgermanes. This indicates that over time the chlorination occurs at the Ge sites in addition to Si eventually producing unstable products. However the preparation of compound 3 was readily obtained in 20 yield at 0 C. and a 10 minute reaction time using a 1 1 molar ratio of SiH GeH and BCl. Pure compound 3 is a stable colorless liquid with a room temperature vapor pressure of 2 Torr.

 c Chlorination of bridging Si sites in butane like GeH SiH The chlorination studies of HGe SiHhave shown that the Si site is preferentially chlorinated to produce a range of new compounds. However in the case of the simplest SiHGeHspecies this prior work established that consecutive chlorinations of terminal Si H bonds is difficult to achieve. On the other hand the chlorination of propane like molecules containing bridging SiHsingle centers such as SiH GeH is much more straightforward. This is also found to be the case for the isostructural trisilane SiH GeH where its bridging SiHis the most susceptible site to full chlorination while the terminal Si H bonds are significantly less prone to this type of substitution. In view of this reaction behavior we pursued a brief study to explore chlorination of related Si Ge based macromolecules that offer a greater capacity for Si H substitutions at bridging sites. These compounds are designed not to contain terminal Si H bonds but rather incorporate highly reactive SiH SiH based linkages exclusively. The simplest candidate that fulfills these criteria is the butane like SiH GeH species which we have previously prepared and studied in detail from a fundamental and practical perspective. The availability of two equivalent reaction sites in this molecule makes the order and degree of chlorination of fundamental interest and represents a natural extension of our synthetic strategy to produce an entire genus of halogenated Si Ge macromolecular hydride derivatives containing SiGe GeSiGe and GeSiSiGe cores. Finally in view of our success in reconciling simulated structural and spectroscopic properties with experiment for the simpler members of this family we undertook a systematic study of the entire sequence of ClHSi GeH n 1 4 molecules and all possible conformations to explore the reaction trends in this more complex system.

f Synthesis and characterizations of ClHSiSiH GeH 4 and ClHSi GeH The mono substituted ClHSiSiH GeH 4 species was readily obtained by reacting an excess of BClwith SiH GeH in a 2 3 ratio. A typical reaction time of one hour at an optimum temperature of 0 C. yielded diborane but also a small amount of unreacted starting material was recovered under these conditions as confirmed by NMR. Efforts to achieved full conversion of SiH GeH using longer reaction times and higher temperatures produced intractable polymeric solids that could not be fully characterized. Compound 4 was isolated by distillation as a colorless liquid with a nominal vapor pressure of 2 Torr. Its Si spectrum showed two peaks due to the SiHand SiHCl moieties at 97.0 and 15.0 ppm respectively. These are down shifted with respect to the SiHresonance 105.0 of the starting material and are consistent with a single chlorine substitution at the Si center. The H spectra revealed a triplet 3.05 a pentet 3.33 a sextet 5.02 and a doublet 3.26 corresponding to protons bonded in the sequence of GeH SiH SiHCl GeH. The integrated intensities the coupling patterns and the positions of the peaks collectively point to this atomic arrangement. The shift corresponding to the Ge H furthest from the Cl site 3.05 is close to that of the starting material 3.11 while the shift of the Ge H adjacent to the SiHCl is slightly downshifted 3.26 . The SiHpeak 3.33 is remarkably close to that of the starting material 3.29 and to other bridging SiHligands in silygermane compounds. The sextet corresponding to the SiHCl 5.02 is significantly down shifted due to the presence of Cl and is close to the one observed in ClHSi GeH 5.07 . The molecular structure is further confirmed with 2 D H COSY which yielded the following correlations i The 3.26 doublet and the 5.02 sextet are associated with GeH SiHCl ii the 5.02 sextet and 3.33 pentet are associated with SiHCl SiH and iii the 3.33 pentet an 3.05 triplet are associated with SiH GeH . The H Si HMQC NMR corroborated the latter assignments and indicated direct couplings between the Si 97 and the H 3.33 pentet and between the Si 15 and the H 5.02 sextet .

The dichlorinated ClHSi GeH species was obtained as a mixture of two substitutional isomers ClSiSiH GeH and ClHSi HGe . Liquid samples with vapor pressure of 1 Torr were prepared by reactions of BCland SiH GeH in a 1 1 ratio at 0 C. The reaction time in this case was considerably reduced to 20 minutes compared to the mono chlorination to avoid formation or mitigate decomposition of unstable byproducts that were also produced under these conditions. The very close boiling points of the dichlorinated ClSiSiH GeH and ClHSi HGe derivatives precluded their individual separation by normal distillation or fractionation techniques. Accordingly their identity was established and their structures were primarily elucidated by H and Si NMR including 2D H COSY and H Si HMQC analyses. For the ClHSi HGe species the proton NMR spectra showed a doublet at 3.26 ppm due to the terminal GeHprotons and a pentet at 4.98 ppm corresponding to the bridging SiH protons. The integrated intensity ratio of the GeHand SiH peaks were found to be 3 1 respectively as expected. The H spectra also displayed three additional peaks at 3.43 singlet 3.42 quartet and 3.07 ppm triplet which were assigned to the GeH SiHand GeHprotons of the sequence contained in the HGe SiCl SiH GeHspecies. The Si spectra of the samples exhibited three distinct resonances at 24.4 88.7 and 17.0 ppm corresponding to the SiCland SiHof HGe SiCl SiH GeHand SiH of ClHSi HGe respectively. Note that the SiHSi resonance of the ClSiSiH GeH is significantly shifted downfield 88.7 with respect to the starting material 105 due to the presence of the chlorine atoms bound to the adjacent silicon. The proposed structures of ClHSi HGe and ClSiSiH GeH are further confirmed by a 2D H COSY spectrum which only show two sets of crosspeaks correlating to Ge H and Si H resonances at 3.26 and 4.98 ppm as well as 3.07 and 3.42 ppm respectively. The H Si HMQC spectrum revealed that the protons at 4.98 and 3.42 ppm are directly coupled to Si resonances at 17.0 and 88.7.

A primary goal was to elucidate on energetic and structural grounds the chlorination trends of HSiGeH. The list of compounds presented in Table 3 is augmented to include the ClSiGeHspecies as well as the compounds HSiGeHCl HSiGeHClwith Cl atoms bound exclusively to Ge. The latter have tentatively observed but not on a reproducible basis. This is presumably due to their relative instability with respect to decomposition or additional chlorinations at their Si sites to produce molecules containing at most four chlorine atoms combined as observed.

We calculated standard reaction free energies Gat 298 K following the generalized reaction given in Eq. 5 

To corroborate the molecular structures of ClSiHGeHand ClSiHGeHderived from the NMR spectra we conducted first principles calculation of the structural and vibrational properties of these compounds. We have successfully used this approach in previous investigations to identify isomeric mixtures of butane like GeHSiHSiHGeHand GeHGeHSiHGeHcompounds on the basis of their vibrational signatures. Although the focus of the present study is on 1 and 2 here we seek to establish important trends in the bonding and vibrational properties for the general sequence of chloro germyl silanes ClHSi GeH x 0 3 for the sake of completeness. An additional benefit is to classify the frequency range and character of the various vibrational modes that are characteristic to these compounds for the elucidation of more complicated higher orders chloro germyl silanes.

Density functional theory simulations of the HSi GeH ClHSi GeH ClHSi GeHand ClSi GeHmolecules were performed using the B3LYP hybrid functional. In our prior work on Si Ge based molecules we have successfully described key structural thermochemical and spectroscopic properties using various basis sets in the 6 311 G family. Since molecules of interest here contain only one germanium atom and up to three chlorine atoms the total electron count ranges from 52 to 100 for which a treatment using the 6 311 G 3df 3pd is tractable. All of the results presented here therefore employ the latter basis set in conjunction with the B3LYP hybrid density functional.

All structural optimizations were performed using tight force convergence criteria using the Gaussian03 code see M. J. Frisch et al. 03 Revision B.04 Gaussian Inc 2003 . The vibrational spectra of all ClHSi GeHmolecules exhibit positive definite vibrational frequencies indicating that the ground state structures are dynamically stable. It is noteworthy that a coarse structure optimization of the ClHSi GeHmolecule produces a soft mode corresponding to internal GeHrotation. A summary of key molecular properties is presented in Table 4 which compares the dipole moments rotational constants bond lengths and bond angles across the sequence. The dipole moment increases significantly with the substitution of chlorine into the silyl unit of the molecules ranging from 0.15 D HSi GeHto 10 fold this value 1.67 D in ClSi GeH. The structural bonding trends through the sequence are unremarkable with principal bonds exhibiting little variation with respect to the inclusion of chlorine. For example the Si Ge Ge H and Si H bonds change by less than a few parts per thousand throughout the molecular sequence while the largest variation is found in the Si Cl bonds which decrease by several in going from ClHSi GeHto ClSi GeH. The bond angle variations are also generally small and the trend reveals an increase in both the H Si Ge and Cl Si Ge angles with chlorine content. The H Ge Si angles also exhibit a minor systematic decrease consistent with increased long range repulsion between the germyl protons and the chlorine atoms. Also listed in Table 3 is the ground state electronic energy E of all molecules together with the latter values corrected for zero point energy ZPE thermal energy E enthalpy H and free energy G at 300 K.

Symmetry analysis of the optimized ground state structures indicates that the end member molecules HSi GeHand ClSi GeH are both prolate symmetric tops possessing Csymmetry while the mono and di chlorinated variants are asymmetric tops possessing a lower Csymmetry. The vibrational spectra of the end members are therefore less complex than those of the less symmetric x 1 2 molecules. This is evident from Table 5 which lists the calculated infrared active vibrational features throughout the molecular sequence. Corresponding low and high frequency plots of the calculated spectra are presented in respectively. No frequency scaling has been applied to these calculated spectra and mode assignments used in Table 5 follow the designations within these figures. In general the high frequency spectra contain two primary features corresponding to asymmetric and symmetric Ge H stretches 2120 2160 cm and their asymmetric and symmetric Si H counterparts 2220 2240 cm . The corresponding low frequency spectra 200 1200 cm are significantly more complex and general assignments by frequency range are as follows i 120 160 cm Si Cl rocking modes ii 320 350 cm Si Ge stretching iii 520 530 cm Si Cl stretches iv 380 480 cm asymmetrical GeH SiHrocking vibrations v 740 800 cm symmetric GeH SiHrocking vibrations and vi 800 950 cm various GeHand SiHwagging vibrations. Among these modes the most intense infrared bands are those in group v designated as symmetric GeH SiHrocking modes. We note that the frequencies of these intense bands are essentially the same in the end member molecules occurring at 796 cmin HSi GeHand 793 cmin ClSi GeH. These spectral features shift to lower frequencies 780 cmand 746 cmin the lower symmetry molecules ClHSi GeHand ClHSi GeH respectively.

A detailed comparison of the calculated and observed spectra of ClHSi GeHis presented in . Based on our prior simulation work using comparable basis sets and model chemistries see Chizmeshya et al. 2006 128 21 6919 6930 we have applied scale factors of 0.989 and 0.979 frequency scale factors to the calculated low and high frequency spectra respectively. As can be seen from the figure the calculated frequencies and intensities match their experimental counterparts very closely suggesting that the vibrational assignments for ClHSi GeHpresented in Table 4 are reliable. We note that a slight reduction in the scale factor used for the high frequency range would improve the agreement further. Finally the simple harmonic vibrational analysis presented here does not account for the splittings observed experimentally. We have investigated several possible origins for this splitting including dimeric interactions and anharmonic effects. In the former case selective vibrational features are split when molecules are coupled depending upon their detailed relative configurations. The interaction strengths were calculated to be on the order of a tenth of a kcal mol and therefore unlikely to be operative at room temperature. The most likely origin of the systematic 12 cmsplittings observed is coupling to rotations in the asymmetrical top molecules. It is noteworthy that the splittings occur in all bands including the high frequency Ge H and Si H modes. This can be explained by the relatively low symmetry of the ClHSi GeHmolecule which leads to A symmetries for all vibrational modes e.g. no A or A symmetry vibrations . Using the rotational constants for the ClHSi GeHmolecule listed in Table 4 we have calculated the room temperature rotational band profiles corresponding to A B and C type contours using an asymmetrical top computer program. These are compared in which indicates that the profiles are distinct and that the C type contour closely matches to the observed absorption band shapes and in particular the apparent splitting of approximately 13 cm.

We have previously utilized SiHGeHand the butane like GeH SiH compound to deposit SiGefilms at low temperatures. In both cases we have obtained materials with high quality morphological and microstructural properties. Nevertheless the use of SiHGeHfor low temperature CMOS selective growth of small size device features is not practical due to the dramatic drop in growth below 475 C. in fact the growth rate is negligible below 450 C. . In contrast both ClHSiGeHand GeH SiH yield growth rates at least 10 times higher than those obtained from SiHGeHin the 400 450 C. range and these compounds even display significant film growth at temperatures below 400 C. It should also be noted that the film quality is comparable using either ClHSiGeHor GeH SiH to grow SiGe.

However albeit GeH SiH shows promise from a technical perspective it represents a demonstration in principle rather than a true proof of concept from an industrial perspective. For instance this compound is difficult to synthesize in quantities greater than a few grams and its thermal stability in relation to storage and transportation is not well understood.

Thus the ClHSiGeHcounterpart appears to be a more practical candidate as a 50 50 SiGe source. Its synthesis is much easier to scale up and the starting materials are readily available and inexpensive. The single step reaction of BClwith HSiGeHis conducted in a solvent free environment ensuring facile isolation and purification to produce semiconductor grade material. Further due to its high vapor pressure the compound can be readily integrated with existing commercial processes involving single wafer low pressure CVD furnaces.

All starting materials were checked by NMR spectroscopy to verify their purities. Potassium germyl KGeH was synthesized via a modified literature preparation in monoglyme by reaction of gaseous GeHwith a finely dispersed sodium potassium 80 K alloy. Note the Teflon bar that was used to stir the GeH Na K monoglyme solution was encapsulated in glass owing to the high reactivity of Teflon with Na K alloys.

Table 7 lists the H and Si chemical shifts derived from our measurements for all chlorinated the products including the previously discussed 1 and 2 as well as the SiHGeHreactant. We note the following trends in these data a For a fixed number of Cl atoms on the Si site increasing the number of Cl atoms on Ge site enhances the shielding of the SiHprotons resulting in a systematic upheld shift of the latter. For example in the sequence ClSiHGeH ClSiHGeHCl and ClSiHGeHCl the Si H shifts are 5.57 5.35 and 5.15 ppm respectively steps of 0.2 ppm . Similarly for ClSiHGeH ClSiHGeHCl and ClSiHGeHClthe SiHshifts are 4.68 4.54 and 4.38 ppm respectively steps of 0.1 ppm . b By contrast the GeHshifts are independent of the number of Cl on the Si site and simply scale down field in proportion to the number of Cl atoms on Ge site GeH 3.2 ppm for GeH 4.8 ppm for GeHCl and 6.0 ppm for GeHCl roughly independent of the number of Cl attached to Si . c The trends in the Si shifts are more subtle and our study finds that for a fixed number of Cl on the Si site slight down field shifts are associated with increasing Cl on the Ge site for ClHSi molecules Si are 24.6 24.3 22.9 for 0 1 and 2 Cl on the Ge site respectively . d Furthermore this effect becomes more pronounced as the number of Cl on the Si site is increased for ClHSi molecules 6Si are 9.8 3.4 1.1 for 0 1 and 2 Cl on the Ge site respectively . This suggests that chlorines bonded to Ge systematically shield the Si nuclei as the number of Cl atoms is increased.

Growth experiments were conducted to investigate the applicability of ClHSiGeHto form semiconductor alloys at low temperatures. The chemical vapor 1 was reacted on the clean Si surface to form films via desorption of HCl and Hbyproducts. The precursor partial pressure and reaction temperature were typically in the range of 10 10Torr and 350 C. 450 C. respectively. The film composition was determined by Rutherford backscattering RBS to be SiGereflecting precisely the Si Ge ratio of the ClHSi GeHprecursor. The heteroepitaxial character of the synthesized films was initially investigated by random and channeling RBS which indicates that the material is perfectly aligned with the substrate. shows that the ratio of the aligned versus the random peak heights which measures the degree of crystallinity decreases from 25 at the interface to 10 at the surface. This indicates a typical defect pile up near the interface while the upper portion of the film is relatively defect free. The film crystallinity was thoroughly investigated by high resolution cross sectional electron microscopy XTEM which revealed commensurate SiGe Si interfaces and perfectly monocrystalline epilayer microstructure see . The TEM samples showed very few defects penetrating through the layer which is consistent with the RBS channeling observation. X ray diffraction XRD revealed highly aligned layers with mosaics spreads as low as degrees strained. The layers were slightly strained as grown and a nominal XRD relaxation of 75 was observed for a film thickness 80 nm. Atomic force microscopy AFM studies show that films with thickness of 80 100 nm display RMS values of 0.7 and 1.1 nm respectively for 10 10 mareas indicating highly planar surfaces. No cross hatched surface patterns caused by misfit dislocations produced during strain relaxation were observed even for films annealed up to 700 C. In fact the surface roughness either remained the same or improved slightly with annealing indicating that the sample planarity is thermally robust.

The deposition of ClHSiGeHwas conducted at 450 C. 10Torr and produced films with thickness ranging from 10 80 nm at growth rates approaching 1 nm which is slightly higher than that obtained from the deposition of ClHSiGeH. For films exceeding 10 20 nm in thickness a quantitative analysis based on RBS showed that the Si content can be as low as 43 . For thinner samples 

The strain state properties of the films were extensively characterized using HR XRD. Two representative samples with layer thicknesses of 10 nm and 60 nm are discussed further. Precise in plane and perpendicular lattice constants were determined by high resolution 224 and 004 on and off axis reciprocal space maps of the entire structure.

In the case of the thinner sample the XRD data revealed that the growth produces two discernible layers in which the initial layer adjacent to the interface is fully strained to the Si substrate a a 5.4309 and a 5.5991 and has a thickness of is 5 7 nm see . Note that in 2 corresponding to the layer adjacent to the interface as shown in the schematic inset falls directly below the Si 224 peak indicating perfect lattice matching within the interface plane. Its elongation is due to the small thickness of the layer. A more diffuse peak 1 is also clearly visible and corresponds to the upper portion of the film. Note that peak 1 lies below the relaxation line connecting the Si peak to the origin indicating partial relaxation 50 .

Using elementary elastic strain relations 2C C where Cand Care bulk SiGe elastic constants and and are the perpendicular and parallel strains the known bowing behavior of bulk Si Ge alloys and the structural data above the composition of the initial alloy layer was determine to be 45 2 Ge and 55 2 Si. The XRD data also showed a diffuse high mosaicity peak peak 1 in indicating that the upper portion of the film grown following the initial layer is 50 relaxed and has lattice constants a 5.4845 and a 5.5654 corresponding to a composition of 47 2 Ge and 53 2 Si. This indicates that this upper layer possesses stoichiometries closer to the expected 50 50 value in accordance with precursor Si Ge content. In this diffusion limited low temperature growth process the tendency to strain match with Si can only be achieved by incorporation of excess Si at the interface layer. Beyond a certain critical thickness 50 60 under these conditions the strain is gradually relieved without any measurable defect formation enabling the full stoichiometry of the precursors to be incorporated.

In the case of the 60 nm thick film we observe that the growth also produces the same initial fully strained layer 10 nm thick adjacent to the interface followed by a transition to a partially strained bulk film whose Si content approaches nominal target values. shows an XTEM micrograph of the entire film thickness in 100 projection. Note that the film surface is atomically flat and the bulk material is devoid of threading defects within a wide field of view typically 2 m . The high resolution image of the interface region shows perfect commensuration and no indication of misfit dislocations in spite of the large mismatch. This observation is consistent with full pseudomorphic growth as determined by XRD. The lack of defects can be explained by our observation of an inherent compositional gradient which accommodates the strain throughout the film. These mechanisms are unique to the low temperature growth protocol afforded by the specifically designed precursor chemistry employed in this study.

Next we pursued preliminary growth studies of SiGealloys using the newly prepared chlorinated compounds to evaluate their selective area growth potential in prototype microelectronic devices. The experiments utilized test wafers containing an array of device structures including simple transistors and various patterns masked by amorphous nitride and oxide thin layers. The depositions were conducted using gas source molecular beam epitaxy GSMBE at 5 10Torr and 400 450 C. via direct insertion of the compound vapor pressure into the chamber at base pressure of 10Torr. The film growth targeted the formation of Ge rich compositions in the range of 65 75 which have applications in IR optolectronics such as photodetectors and modulators. The as deposited samples were examined by optical microscopy which indicated that the color of the nitride oxide masked regions on the surface of the wafer had remained unchanged while the color of the pure Si regions had turned from metallic grey to light brown. The latter is characteristic of high Ge content SiGesuggesting that selective deposition had potentially occurred. Additional characterizations of the wafers were performed by cross sectional electron microscopy XTEM Raman scattering Rutherford backscattering RBS and atomic force microscopy AFM and the data collectively revealed the presence of atomically flat Si Ge films with single crystalline microstructures throughout the samples. The film nominal thickness was estimated by the random RBS and confirmed by XTEM to be in the 50 nm range spanning the full height of the drain source S D recess region. Average growth rates up to 7 nm per minute were obtained in these experiments. XTEM micrographs of all samples clearly demonstrated that the Si Ge films deposited selectively and conformably on typical device structures filling the drain source recess regions S D .

Micro Raman spectroscopy was used to study the selectivity of growth and determine the Si Ge composition throughout the wafer surface at a spatial resolution of 1 m. The spectra of all samples obtained from the nitride oxide covered features showed only a single peak corresponding to the Si Si vibrations of the underlying substrate indicating that no discernable Si Ge growth had occurred in these areas in agreement with the XTEM observations. The Raman spectra obtained from the unprotected Si regions however showed three additional peaks corresponding to the characteristic Si Si Si Ge and Ge Ge alloy vibrations indicating significant growth of crystalline SiGefilms with composition of SiGe. It is important to note that the Raman composition was obtained as an average from a large number measurements of individual device features throughout the entire wafer and closely matched the bulk film composition obtained from RBS. The RBS Raman results collectively suggest that precise compositional control can be achieved by selective area deposition of our compounds. These afford low temperature depositions that produce controllable and fairly homogeneous alloys within and among individual device architectures. This level of uniformity is critically important for achieving reliable reproducible and cost effective device fabrication and performance. In addition the use of single sources simplifies significantly the integration scheme by circumventing complex multi component reactions and corrosive Cletchants which are necessary to promote selective deposition in conventional processes.

In addition to selective deposition experiments we also explore the possibility of achieving highly strained states in our deposited films. show a reciprocal space map RSM of a 40 nm thick SiGelayer grown by deposition of ClHSi GeH . The composition of the film as measured by RBS closely matches that of the corresponding precursor indicating that the entire SiGecore is being incorporated into the material. The in plane and vertical lattice parameters were determine to be 5.4986 and 5.6530 respectively. Using these values and standard elasticity theory we obtain an unprecedented compressive strain of 1.6 . Note that this value is significantly higher than the 1.2 strains that are possible from state of the art film containing 30 Ge. The RSM plot in reveals that our film is 40 relaxed suggesting that it may be possible to realize fully strained films beyond the current proof of principle state reported here by optimizing deposition conditions such as the growth rate and temperature.
