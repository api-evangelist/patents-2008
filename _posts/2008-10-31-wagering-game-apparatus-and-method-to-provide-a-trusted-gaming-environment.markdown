A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

The present invention relates generally to gaming machines and methods for playing wagering games and more particularly to a gaming machine having video displays that provide images that simulate mechanical type spinning reels.

Gaming machines such as slot machines video poker machines and the like have been a cornerstone of the gaming industry for several years. Generally the popularity of such machines with players is dependent on the likelihood or perceived likelihood of winning money at the machine and the intrinsic entertainment value of the machine relative to other available gaming options. Where the available gaming options include a number of competing machines and the expectation of winning at each machine is roughly the same or believed to be the same players are likely to be attracted to the most entertaining and exciting machines. Shrewd operators consequently strive to employ the most entertaining and exciting machines features and enhancements available because such machines attract frequent play and hence increase profitability to the operator. Therefore there is a continuing need for gaming machine manufacturers to continuously develop new games and improved gaming enhancements that will attract frequent play through enhanced entertainment value to the player.

One concept that has been successfully employed to enhance the entertainment value of a game is the concept of a secondary or bonus game that may be played in conjunction with a basic game. The bonus game may comprise any type of game either similar to or completely different from the basic game which is entered upon the occurrence of a selected event or outcome in the basic game. Generally bonus games provide a greater expectation of winning than the basic game and may also be accompanied with more attractive or unusual video displays and or audio. Bonus games may additionally award players with progressive jackpot awards that are funded at least in part by a percentage of coin in from the gaming machine or a plurality of participating gaming machines. Because the bonus game concept offers tremendous advantages in player appeal and excitement relative to other known games and because such games are attractive to both players and operators there is a continuing need to develop gaming machines with new types of bonus games to satisfy the demands of players and operators.

Video based slot machines allow for flexibility in game design and do not require any additional hardware for implementing different games such as bonus games. With respect to flexibility in game design the video display of a video based slot machine can depict complex and entertaining graphical images animations and play sequences that cannot be employed in mechanical slot machines. Video based slot machines do not require any additional hardware for implementing bonus games because the bonus game may be depicted on the primary video display and executed by the same game controller used to execute the video slot game.

Video based slot machines and mechanical slot machines generally appeal to different segments of the market. Although many players are attracted to the complex and entertaining graphical images animations and play sequences afforded by video based slot machines many players are still drawn to mechanical slot machines because they are simplistic machines that often only pay on a single pay line and only require a pull of a handle to initiate a spin of the reels. Part of the reason that these players avoid video based slot machines is that the simulated reels on the video based machines are visually indistinct from one another if not sterile in appearance.

The present invention relates to technology techniques instruction sets methods and or systems for making a gaming environment particularly but not necessarily a 3 D gaming environment appear more trustworthy to players. The present invention is useful example to ease the transition from a traditional mechanical slot machine to a video slot machine for players who trust mechanical slots but lack confidence in or trust in video slots.

The present invention includes a method of configuring a wagering game system to provide a trusted gaming environment comprising the act of randomly selecting at least one simulated physical imperfection from a plurality of available simulated physical imperfections to associate with at least one element of a video image output to a wagering game machine video display and associating the selected simulated physical imperfection with at least one element of the video image.

The present invention also includes a method of configuring a plurality of wagering game machines to provide a trusted gaming environment which includes in another aspect the act of randomly selecting a simulated physical imperfection from a plurality of available simulated physical imperfections to associate with at least one element of a video image output to a wagering game machine video display. The method also includes the acts of associating the selected simulated physical imperfection with a video image output to a selected one of the plurality of wagering game machines and repeating the acts of randomly selecting a simulated physical imperfection and associating the selected simulated physical imperfection with a video image for each of the plurality of wagering game machines.

In yet another aspect of the present concepts a method of configuring a wagering game machine to provide a trusted gaming environment includes the acts of selecting an audio signature corresponding to a predetermined simulated physical imperfection of a simulated moving element from a plurality of available audio signatures and associating the selected audio signature with video image data comprising video images for a simulated moving element.

In a further aspect of the present concepts a gaming system is configured to provide a trusted gaming environment for wagering games and includes a controller configured to conduct a wagering game and to render simulated mechanical reels within the wagering game in 3 D the simulated mechanical reels displaying images indicating a randomly selected outcome of the wagering game. The gaming system also includes at least one memory bearing executable instructions configured to render on a video display of a wagering game machine simulated mechanical reels within the wagering game and to randomly introduce at least one randomly selected simulated physical imperfection to the simulated mechanical reels.

Still another aspect of the present concepts includes a gaming system configured to provide a trusted gaming environment for wagering games for a plurality of linked wagering game machines. In this gaming system are provided a plurality of wagering game machines each of the plurality of wagering game machines comprising a housing a video display and an audio system. The gaming system also includes at least one controller configured to conduct a wagering game on each of the plurality of wagering game machines and to render a simulated mechanical element in 3 D within wagering games conducted on the plurality of wagering game machines the simulated mechanical elements displaying images indicating a randomly selected outcome of the wagering game.

The touch keys may be used to implement the same functions as push buttons . Alternatively the push buttons may provide inputs for one aspect of the operating the game while the touch keys may allow for input needed for another aspect of the game.

The various components of the gaming machine may be connected directly to or contained within the housing as seen in or may be located outboard of the housing and connected to the housing via a variety of different wired or wireless connection methods. Thus the gaming machine comprises these components whether housed in the housing or outboard of the housing and connected remotely.

The operation of the basic wagering game is displayed to the player on the primary display . The primary display can also display the bonus game associated with the basic wagering game. The primary display may take the form of a cathode ray tube CRT a high resolution LCD a plasma display an LED or any other type of display suitable for use in the gaming machine . As shown the primary display includes the touch screen overlaying the entire display or a portion thereof to allow players to make game related selections. Alternatively the primary display of the gaming machine may include a number of mechanical reels to display the outcome in visual association with at least one payline . In the illustrated embodiment the gaming machine is an upright version in which the primary display is oriented vertically relative to the player. Alternatively the gaming machine may be a slant top version in which the primary display is slanted at about a thirty degree angle toward the player of the gaming machine .

A player begins play of the basic wagering game by making a wager via the value input device of the gaming machine . A player can select play by using the player input device via the buttons or the touch screen keys . The basic game consists of a plurality of symbols arranged in an array and includes at least one payline that indicates one or more outcomes of the basic game. Such outcomes are randomly selected in response to the wagering input by the player. At least one of the plurality of randomly selected outcomes may be a start bonus outcome which can include any variations of symbols or symbol combinations triggering a bonus game.

In some embodiments the gaming machine may also include a player information reader that allows for identification of a player by reading a card with information indicating his or her true identity. The player information reader is shown in as a card reader but may take on many forms including a ticket reader bar code scanner RFID transceiver or computer readable storage medium interface. Currently identification is generally used by casinos for rewarding certain players with complimentary services or special offers. For example a player may be enrolled in the gaming establishment s loyalty club and may be awarded certain complimentary services as that player collects points in his or her player tracking account. The player inserts his or her card into the player information reader which allows the casino s computers to register that player s wagering at the gaming machine . The gaming machine may use the secondary display or other dedicated player tracking display for providing the player with information about his or her account or other player specific information. Also in some embodiments the information reader may be used to restore game assets that the player achieved and saved during a previous game session.

Depicted in is a handheld or mobile gaming machine . Like the free standing gaming machine the handheld gaming machine is preferably an electronic gaming machine configured to play a video casino game such as but not limited to blackjack slots keno poker blackjack and roulette. The handheld gaming machine comprises a housing or casing and includes input devices including a value input device and a player input device . For output the handheld gaming machine includes but is not limited to a primary display a secondary display one or more speakers one or more player accessible ports e.g. an audio output jack for headphones a video headset jack etc. and other conventional I O devices and ports which may or may not be player accessible. In the embodiment depicted in the handheld gaming machine comprises a secondary display that is rotatable relative to the primary display . The optional secondary display may be fixed movable and or detachable attachable relative to the primary display . Either the primary display and or secondary display may be configured to display any aspect of a non wagering game wagering game secondary games bonus games progressive wagering games group games shared experience games or events game events game outcomes scrolling information text messaging emails alerts or announcements broadcast information subscription information and handheld gaming machine status.

The player accessible value input device may comprise for example a slot located on the front side or top of the casing configured to receive credit from a stored value card e.g. casino card smart card debit card credit card etc. inserted by a player. In another aspect the player accessible value input device may comprise a sensor e.g. an RF sensor configured to sense a signal e.g. an RF signal output by a transmitter e.g. an RF transmitter carried by a player. The player accessible value input device may also or alternatively include a ticket reader or barcode scanner for reading information stored on a credit ticket a card or other tangible portable credit or funds storage device. The credit ticket or card may also authorize access to a central account which can transfer money to the handheld gaming machine .

Still other player accessible value input devices may require the use of touch keys on the touch screen display e.g. primary display and or secondary display or player input devices . Upon entry of player identification information and preferably secondary authorization information e.g. a password PIN number stored value card number predefined key sequences etc. the player may be permitted to access a player s account. As one potential optional security feature the handheld gaming machine may be configured to permit a player to only access an account the player has specifically set up for the handheld gaming machine . Other conventional security features may also be utilized to for example prevent unauthorized access to a player s account to minimize an impact of any unauthorized access to a player s account or to prevent unauthorized access to any personal information or funds temporarily stored on the handheld gaming machine .

The player accessible value input device may itself comprise or utilize a biometric player information reader which permits the player to access available funds on a player s account either alone or in combination with another of the aforementioned player accessible value input devices . In an embodiment wherein the player accessible value input device comprises a biometric player information reader transactions such as an input of value to the handheld device a transfer of value from one player account or source to an account associated with the handheld gaming machine or the execution of another transaction for example could all be authorized by a biometric reading which could comprise a plurality of biometric readings from the biometric device.

Alternatively to enhance security a transaction may be optionally enabled only by a two step process in which a secondary source confirms the identity indicated by a primary source. For example a player accessible value input device comprising a biometric player information reader may require a confirmatory entry from another biometric player information reader or from another source such as a credit card debit card player ID card fob key PIN number password hotel room key etc. Thus a transaction may be enabled by for example a combination of the personal identification input e.g. biometric input with a secret PIN number or a combination of a biometric input with a fob input or a combination of a fob input with a PIN number or a combination of a credit card input with a biometric input. Essentially any two independent sources of identity one of which is secure or personal to the player e.g. biometric readings PIN number password etc. could be utilized to provide enhanced security prior to the electronic transfer of any funds. In another aspect the value input device may be provided remotely from the handheld gaming machine .

The player input device comprises a plurality of push buttons on a button panel for operating the handheld gaming machine . In addition or alternatively the player input device may comprise a touch screen mounted to a primary display and or secondary display . In one aspect the touch screen is matched to a display screen having one or more selectable touch keys selectable by a user s touching of the associated area of the screen using a finger or a tool such as a stylus pointer. A player enables a desired function either by touching the touch screen at an appropriate touch key or by pressing an appropriate push button on the button panel. The touch keys may be used to implement the same functions as push buttons . Alternatively the push buttons may provide inputs for one aspect of the operating the game while the touch keys may allow for input needed for another aspect of the game. The various components of the handheld gaming machine may be connected directly to or contained within the casing as seen in or may be located outboard of the casing and connected to the casing via a variety of hardwired tethered or wireless connection methods. Thus the handheld gaming machine may comprise a single unit or a plurality of interconnected parts e.g. wireless connections which may be arranged to suit a player s preferences.

The operation of the basic wagering game on the handheld gaming machine is displayed to the player on the primary display . The primary display can also display the bonus game associated with the basic wagering game. The primary display preferably takes the form of a high resolution LCD a plasma display an LED or any other type of display suitable for use in the handheld gaming machine . The size of the primary display may vary from for example about a 2 3 display to a 15 or 17 display. In at least some aspects the primary display is a 7 10 display. As the weight of and or power requirements of such displays decreases with improvements in technology it is envisaged that the size of the primary display may be increased. Optionally coatings or removable films or sheets may be applied to the display to provide desired characteristics e.g. anti scratch anti glare bacterially resistant and anti microbial films etc. . In at least some embodiments the primary display and or secondary display may have a 16 9 aspect ratio or other aspect ratio e.g. 4 3 . The primary display and or secondary display may also each have different resolutions different color schemes and different aspect ratios.

As with the free standing gaming machine a player begins play of the basic wagering game on the handheld gaming machine by making a wager e.g. via the value input device or an assignment of credits stored on the handheld gaming machine via the touch screen keys player input device or buttons on the handheld gaming machine . In at least some aspects the basic game may comprise a plurality of symbols arranged in an array and includes at least one payline that indicates one or more outcomes of the basic game. Such outcomes are randomly selected in response to the wagering input by the player. At least one of the plurality of randomly selected outcomes may be a start bonus outcome which can include any variations of symbols or symbol combinations triggering a bonus game.

In some embodiments the player accessible value input device of the handheld gaming machine may double as a player information reader that allows for identification of a player by reading a card with information indicating the player s identity e.g. reading a player s credit card player ID card smart card etc. . The player information reader may alternatively or also comprise a bar code scanner RFID transceiver or computer readable storage medium interface. In one presently preferred aspect the player information reader shown by way of example in comprises a biometric sensing device.

Turning now to the various components of the gaming machine are controlled by a central processing unit CPU also referred to herein as a controller or processor such as a microcontroller or microprocessor . To provide gaming functions the controller executes one or more game programs stored in a computer readable storage medium in the form of memory . The controller performs the random selection using a random number generator RNG of an outcome from the plurality of possible outcomes of the wagering game. Alternatively the random event may be determined at a remote controller. The remote controller may use either an RNG or pooling scheme for its central determination of a game outcome. It should be appreciated that the controller may include one or more microprocessors including but not limited to a master processor a slave processor and a secondary or parallel processor.

The controller is also coupled to the system memory and a money credit detector . The system memory may comprise a volatile memory e.g. a random access memory RAM and a non volatile memory e.g. an EEPROM . The system memory may include multiple RAM and multiple program memories. The money credit detector signals the processor that money and or credits have been input via the value input device . Preferably these components are located within the housing of the gaming machine . However as explained above these components may be located outboard of the housing and connected to the remainder of the components of the gaming machine via a variety of different wired or wireless connection methods.

As seen in the controller is also connected to and controls the primary display the player input device and a payoff mechanism . The payoff mechanism is operable in response to instructions from the controller to award a payoff to the player in response to certain winning outcomes that might occur in the basic game or the bonus game s . The payoff may be provided in the form of points bills tickets coupons cards etc. For example in the payoff mechanism includes both a ticket printer and a coin outlet . However any of a variety of payoff mechanisms well known in the art may be implemented including cards coins tickets smartcards cash etc. The payoff amounts distributed by the payoff mechanism are determined by one or more pay tables stored in the system memory .

Communications between the controller and both the peripheral components of the gaming machine and external systems occur through input output I O circuits . More specifically the controller controls and receives inputs from the peripheral components of the gaming machine through the input output circuits . Further the controller communicates with the external systems via the I O circuits and a communication path e.g. serial parallel IR RC 10bT etc. . The external systems may include a gaming network other gaming machines a gaming server communications hardware or a variety of other interfaced systems or components. Although the I O circuits may be shown as a single block it should be appreciated that each of the I O circuits may include a number of different types of I O circuits.

Controller as used herein comprises any combination of hardware software and or firmware that may be disposed or resident inside and or outside of the gaming machine that may communicate with and or control the transfer of data between the gaming machine and a bus another computer processor or device and or a service and or a network. The controller may comprise one or more controllers or processors. In the controller in the gaming machine is depicted as comprising a CPU but the controller may alternatively comprise a CPU in combination with other components such as the I O circuits and the system memory . The controller may reside partially or entirely inside or outside of the machine . The control system for a handheld gaming machine may be similar to the control system for the free standing gaming machine except that the functionality of the respective on board controllers may vary.

The gaming machines may communicate with external systems in a wired or wireless manner such that each machine operates as a thin client having relatively less functionality a thick client having relatively more functionality or through any range of functionality therebetween e.g. a rich client . As a generally thin client the gaming machine may operate primarily as a display device to display the results of gaming outcomes processed externally for example on a server as part of the external systems . In this thin client configuration the server executes game code and determines game outcomes e.g. with a random number generator while the controller on board the gaming machine processes display information to be displayed on the display s of the machine. In an alternative rich client configuration the server determines game outcomes while the controller on board the gaming machine executes game code and processes display information to be displayed on the display s of the machines. In yet another alternative thick client configuration the controller on board the gaming machine executes game code determines game outcomes and processes display information to be displayed on the display s e.g. of the machine. Numerous alternative configurations are possible such that the aforementioned and other functions may be performed onboard or external to the gaming machine as may be necessary for particular applications. It should be understood that the gaming machines may take on a wide variety of forms such as a free standing machine a portable or handheld device primarily used for gaming a mobile telecommunications device such as a mobile telephone or personal daily assistant PDA a counter top or bar top gaming machine or other personal electronic device such as a portable television MP3 player entertainment device etc.

As noted above the present invention relates to technology techniques instruction sets methods and or systems for making a gaming environment such as but not limited to a 3 D gaming environment appear more trustworthy to players. Mechanical systems are believed by some players to be more trustworthy or familiar. Such players may even deem particular machines as lucky over substantially identical machines because the lucky machine may have a particular physical characteristic that slightly distinguishes one machine from another and to which the player develops an affinity. The uniformity or virtual perfection imposed by conventional video based gaming machines is therefore potentially offputting to some such as those who seek to or desire a connection with a particular machine. The present invention therefore seeks to differentiate machines from one another in a generally subtle manner although such differentiation need not be subtle. In this manner among banks of wagering game machines each machine may be at least slightly differentiated from every other machine so as to avoid a sterile sameness among the bank.

The present concepts are applicable to any video display device arrangement or system and may include but is not limited to a CRT or a flat or curved panel video display e.g. LCD plasma etc. . For example the present concepts could be implemented on the wagering game machine primary display or secondary display or on handheld gaming machine primary display or secondary display shown in . show various non limiting configurations of wagering game displays or display systems that may be advantageously used in accord with the concepts disclosed herein in combination with a transparent layer that is curved to approximate the physical shape of conventional mechanical reels so as to blur the boundary between conventional mechanical reels and the video image system that replaces such mechanical reels.

The embodiments shown in are described in more detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 847 560 titled Wagering Game With Simulated Mechanical Reels to Timothy J. Durham et al. which is assigned to the assignee of the present application and which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. PCT Application Serial Nos. PCT US2007 015171 PCT US2007 015185 and PCT US2007 015186 each filed on Jun. 29 2007 and each being titled Wagering Game with Simulated Mechanical Reels are also assigned to the assignee of the present application and are also incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

As one exemplary aspect of the present concepts shown in a method of configuring a wagering game system to provide a trusted gaming environment includes the act A of randomly selecting at least one simulated physical imperfection from a plurality of available simulated physical imperfections to associate with at least one element of a video image output to a wagering game machine e.g. video display e.g. . The video image is defined herein as a carrier wave or signal bearing data relating to a video output of the wagering game machine including but not limited to video image and or audio data and or video image and or audio data instructions. The method of configuring a wagering game system to provide a trusted gaming environment includes also includes the act A of associating the selected simulated physical imperfection with at least one element of the video image.

The simulated physical imperfections may include any simulated physical imperfection of the simulated moving or movable element e.g. mechanical reel s mechanical wheel s moving object on display etc. and or of a stationary element e.g. background screen . Non limiting examples include for the example of a simulated physical imperfection of a moving element a faded symbol a misprinted symbol discoloration e.g. stain dirt dust etc. condensation or an appearance of physical degradation such as corrosion abrasion cuts chips gouges scratches peeling delamination or wear of the moving element. A simulated physical imperfection could also include differences in the surface textures or reflectivity of portions of a moving element or as between adjacent moving elements. Additional examples of a simulated physical imperfection of a moving element include a perceptible wobble in the movement of the moving element above average spin duration or below average spin duration for the moving element e.g. as compared to the remaining reels on that wagering game machine or on reels of similar machines or above or below average dampening of the movement of the moving element e.g. less or more bouncing or oscillating of the simulated reel when it stops . Still additional examples of a simulated physical imperfection of a moving element include dim back lighting of the moving element mis positioned lighting of the moving element or differing lighting intensities of different portions of the moving element which would provide a perception or burned out lights malfunctioning lights or the like. Yet other examples of a simulated physical imperfection of a moving element include foreign object intrusion such as a simulated dead bug on the moving element or adjacent thereto such as on the transparent layer or a simulated live bug moving on or relative to the moving element.

Likewise in accord with the present concepts the simulated physical imperfections need not be limited to moving elements and the present concepts specifically include simulated physical imperfections related to stationary elements. Stationary elements include but are not limited to a background screen a stationary element on a background screen a pop up window or an informational window. The simulated physical imperfection for such stationary element s include but are not limited to those noted above with respect to moving or movable elements and also include imperfections particularly associated with a background video image such as but not limited to screen burn in screen misalignment screen color screen sharpness screen balance screen brightness and distortion e.g. associated with a simulated magnetic interference .

In still other aspects the simulated physical imperfections may be themed to correspond at least in part to a theme of a wagering game to which the simulated physical imperfections is associated. In other words the theme of the game may influence the population of available simulated physical imperfections. A western themed game may for example include more dust the appearance of scored paper cigarette burns oil stains hay or the like. A space themed game may include for example powered mineral matter unidentifiable goo or even floating objects with a potential for greater distortion e.g. magnetic effects.

The simulated physical imperfection need not be limited to an imperfection that is visible to a player. For example the simulated physical imperfection may comprise a sound appearing to be related to an underlying physical imperfection. Thus the simulated physical imperfection may comprise a squeaking noise e.g. a constant noise an intermittent noise of a substantially fixed frequency an intermittent noise of an indeterminate frequency a rattling noise a hum a hiss or a noise typically made or that might be expected to be made by a defective or malfunctioning mechanical or electrical component. Accordingly the simulated physical imperfection may comprise an audio signature corresponding to a predetermined simulated physical imperfection of an element of a wagering game machine such as but not limited to a simulated moving element. This audio signature may then be related to a particular wagering gaming machine as described herein. In particular as shown in the act A of randomly selecting at least one simulated physical imperfection from a plurality of available simulated physical imperfections to associate with at least one element of a video image output to a wagering game machine e.g. video display e.g. may include the embedding of such an audio signature in an audio track of a video image.

The method shown in may optionally include the act A of saving in a computer readable medium the association of the selected simulated physical imperfection with the at least one element of the video image for subsequent play of a wagering game. Computer readable medium as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to a processor for execution and program product or instructions refers to such a computer readable medium bearing processor executable instructions. Computer readable mediums include but are not limited to non volatile media or volatile media e.g. hard discs magnetic tape CD ROM DVD RAM PROM EPROM FLASH EPROM memory chips dynamic memory or any other medium from which a computer can read or transmission media e.g. coaxial cables copper wire fiber optics bus acoustic waves light waves RF etc. . Thus the association of the selected simulated physical imperfection with an element of a video image may be saved for subsequent play of a wagering game.

As shown in the association of the above noted randomly selected simulated physical imperfection with at least one element of the video image permits the concurrent e.g. via rendering on the fly or subsequent displaying of the video images and the associated simulated physical imperfection during a wagering game in act A.

Optionally the available simulated physical imperfections may comprise different degrees of severity. In one aspect a single simulated physical imperfection may be available for selection but may represent a range of severity and or manifestations of the simulated physical imperfection. For example for a simulated physical imperfection of a simulated stain on a simulated mechanical reel numerous variants may be randomly selectable each variant having a distinguishing shape color location and or texture. As another example a simulated physical imperfection in the spin characteristics of a simulated mechanical reel such as the spin speed spin duration reel dampening eccentricity or wobble may comprise different severity levels or degrees e.g. spin duration in seconds of x 0.5 . . . x 0.1 . . . x 0.02 x 0.01 x 0.01 x 0.02 . . . x 0.1 . . . x 0.5 etc. where x is a baseline spin duration and any time increment or value relative thereto may be used . Thus even where only a single simulated physical imperfection is available for selection such simulated physical imperfection may yet present a wide range of available manifestations from which a random selection may be had.

Obviously where a plurality of different types of simulated physical imperfections are available for selection the better is the ability to distinguish a particular wagering game machine among a population of like wagering game machines. Thus in accord with at least some aspects of the present concepts the method of configuring a wagering game system to provide a trusted gaming environment includes randomly selecting a simulated physical imperfection or more than one simulated physical imperfection from a set of available simulated physical imperfections that may include different simulated physical imperfections and or a single simulated physical imperfection having different selectable manifestations e.g. severity appearance size location characteristics etc. and or different simulated physical imperfections one or more of which may have different selectable manifestations. shows for example act A of randomly selecting from a set of available manifestations of a simulated physical imperfection a particular manifestation e.g. severity appearance size location characteristics etc. of the simulated physical imperfection.

As further shown in yet another optional aspect of the present concepts may be represented in part by act A which comprises further to acts A and A the act of randomly selecting a different simulated physical imperfection from the plurality of available simulated physical imperfections to associate with the video images. This random selection of a different simulated physical imperfection from the plurality of available simulated physical imperfections to associate with the video images may occur subsequent to the act A of saving of the association of the selected simulated physical imperfection with the associated element of the video image and or the act A of displaying of the video images and the associated simulated physical imperfection during a wagering game. Alternatively act A could occur after or concurrent with act A so that a plurality of simulated physical imperfections are substantially simultaneously determined and associated with one or more elements of the video image in act A. Such plural simulated physical imperfections and associations with the video images may be saved in a computer readable medium for subsequent play of a wagering game as in act A or may be provided in an on the fly rending.

Any of the acts A through A singly or in combination may be performed in accord with a schedule an occurrence of a predetermined event a manual input randomly a lapse of time a state of an adjacent wagering game machine an introduction of a player identifier and or a counter related to a duration of wagering game play for the wagering game machine. To provide one illustrative example at start up of the wagering game machine a plurality of simulated physical imperfections A n where n represents any integer having severity levels of 1 10. The processor selects a random number of simulated physical imperfections or a designated number thereof. In the present example it will be assumed that the processor selected five simulated physical imperfections having severity levels of 2 8 5 7 and 3 respectively i.e. A B E T V . The processor may optionally weight one or more of the parameters e.g. 0.9 A B E 1.2 T V .

Moreover certain simulated physical imperfections such as opposites which would tend to cancel each other out or similar traits which might tend to be additive or attract to much attention may be designated as being mutually exclusive or as being subject to a mandatory weighting to diminish potentially detrimental additive effects. For example it may not be desirable to have a processor s random selection to cause the simulated physical imperfections of both moderate to severe dust on the reel and moderate to severe dust on the transparent layer or window so one of these simulated physical imperfections may be either discarded in favor of another random selection or attenuated or weighted to a lesser severity. As another example it may not be desirable to have a processor s random selection to cause the simulated physical imperfections of both moderate to severe dust on the reel and moderate to severe bad lighting of the simulated mechanical object e.g. simulated mechanical reel so one of these simulated physical imperfections may be either discarded in favor of another random selection or attenuated. Thus in accord with at least some aspects of the present concepts some selections random or otherwise might be dependent upon other selections and therefore may be subject to a dependency condition e.g. an AND OR table weighting table etc. .

Returning to the timing of the or triggering of any of the acts A through A singly or in combination in accord with a schedule or a lapse of time for example the manifestation s e.g. severity appearance size location characteristics etc. of the simulated physical imperfection s may get worse over time in accord with a specified schedule or a randomized schedule. Thus for example a simulated physical imperfection A where n is an integer representation of the severity level of the simulated physical imperfection could progress from Aon day 1 to Aon day 10 at which time for example the process could decrement the severity level downwardly the processor could select another simulated physical imperfection in place of that simulated physical imperfection or the processor could eliminate that simulated physical imperfection or take some other action.

As noted above the processor could be configured to set simulated physical imperfection s and or associated manifestation s at one wagering game machine to the same state as an adjacent wagering game machine with or without variation. In this manner the differences between adjacent machine made be made more subtle to casual observation. In another example the processor could be configured to adjust a setting of a simulated physical imperfection s or particular manifestation s of simulated physical imperfections at a first wagering game machine to the same state as a second wagering game machine whether local or remotely located because such second wagering game machine has a higher than average level of coin in. In another example the processor could be configured to adjust a setting of a simulated physical imperfection or particular manifestations of simulated physical imperfection at a wagering game machine when the wagering game machine has a lower than average level of coin in e.g. as compared to other local wagering game machine having differing simulated physical imperfection s or particular manifestations of simulated physical imperfections . The adjustments noted above could comprise for example elimination of one or more of the simulated physical imperfections and or associated manifestations in effect at the wagering game machine in favor of other randomly determined simulated physical imperfections and or associated manifestations.

Thus the wagering game machines and or gaming systems employing the present concepts are optionally adapted to dynamically manage the simulated physical imperfections or simulated physical imperfections having particular manifestations in accord with performance metrics. If particular simulated physical imperfections or simulated physical imperfections having particular manifestations are determined for example to generate greater coin in than wagering game machines having different simulated physical imperfections or particular manifestations thereof the other wagering game machines may be automatically changed to reflect such other more successful simulated physical imperfections or particular manifestations thereof.

In other aspects the simulated physical imperfections or simulated physical imperfections having particular manifestations may be saved by a player or may be associated with a player such as through a player s club card player ID player biometric characteristic or the like. Thus where a player develops an affinity for a particular combination of simulated physical imperfections or particular manifestations of one or more simulated physical imperfections the player may voluntarily save such settings. However these associations need not be known to the player. The wagering game establishment may determine for example that a player historically wagers more with a particular simulated physical imperfection simulated physical imperfections or particular manifestations of one or more simulated physical imperfections e.g. a gimpy reel and may subsequently alter the setting of a wagering game machine at which the player has logged into to reflect the setting that the player appears to favor.

In yet other aspects the automatic altering of simulated physical imperfections or particular manifestations of simulated physical imperfections may be tied to a schedule as noted above. Although the schedule for altering of simulated physical imperfections or particular manifestations of simulated physical imperfections may be applied uniformly for a particular wagering game machine or group of wagering game machines each of the simulated physical imperfections or particular manifestations of simulated physical imperfections for a particular wagering game machine or group of wagering game machines may be tied to a separate schedule so that the individual alterations on a wagering game machine or between similarly situated wagering game machines are less noticeable. In still other examples such alterations may be related to a counter that tracks a metric of wagering game play such as a duration of wagering game play or an amount of coin in for the wagering game machine or for an associated group of wagering game machines.

In another aspect of the present concepts shown in a method of configuring a plurality of wagering game machines to provide a trusted gaming environment comprises the acts of randomly selecting a simulated physical imperfection from a plurality of available simulated physical imperfections to associate with at least one element of a video image output to a wagering game machine video display A such as primary display of wagering game machine and associating the selected simulated physical imperfection with a video image output to a selected one of the wagering game machines A as described above. This method includes in act A repeating the acts of randomly selecting a simulated physical imperfection and associating the selected simulated physical imperfection with a video image for each of the wagering game machines. Thus this method specifically encompasses the application of the trusted gaming environment to a population of wagering game machines.

As with the previously described method this method of configuring a wagering game machine to provide a trusted gaming environment may further comprise the act A of displaying the video image and the associated selected simulated physical imperfection on a video display e.g. of one or more of the wagering game machines during a wagering game. Likewise as described above the method may include the act A of saving the randomly selected simulated physical imperfection in association with a respective one of the plurality of wagering game machines for each of the plurality of wagering game machines and or the act A of randomly selecting from a set of available manifestations of a simulated physical imperfection a manifestation of the simulated physical imperfection.

In another aspect of the method described in the method may further comprise the acts of randomly selecting another simulated physical imperfection for association with a selected wagering game machine act A and determining an acceptability of an additive effect of the randomly selected simulated physical imperfections act A associating the randomly selected simulated physical imperfection with a video image for a selected wagering game machine act A . These acts of randomly selecting determining and associating A A A may then be repeated for remaining ones of the plurality of wagering game machines until each of the plurality of wagering game machines is associated with more than one simulated physical imperfection in act A. The act A of determining of an acceptability of an additive effect of the randomly selected simulated physical imperfections is intended to ensure that the combined effects of the randomly selected simulated physical imperfections or particular manifestations thereof are not overly distracting to the player or detrimental to the wagering game play experience.

Still another method of configuring a wagering game machine to provide a trusted gaming environment shown in includes the acts of selecting an audio signature corresponding to a predetermined simulated physical imperfection of a simulated moving element from a plurality of available audio signatures act A associating the selected audio signature with video image data comprising video images for a simulated moving element act A . The method may also include saving in a computer readable medium the association of the selected audio signature with the video image data for subsequent play of a wagering game act A . The simulated moving element may comprise for example one or more simulated mechanical object s simulated mechanical reel s or simulated mechanical wheel s bearing indicia relating to the wagering game. The act of selecting in at least some aspects comprises random selection of an audio signature from a plurality of available audio signatures corresponding to a predetermined simulated physical imperfection of a simulated moving element.

The method of configuring a wagering game machine to provide a trusted gaming environment according to the example of may further comprise the act A of displaying a movement of the simulated moving element on the wagering game terminal video display and the act A of outputting from a speaker such as speaker of handheld gaming machine the selected audio signature so as to audibly attribute the simulated physical imperfection to the simulated moving element. Thus for example a squeaking noise may be associated with a simulated mechanical reel that exhibits a slight wobble or with a simulated mechanical reel that exhibits some corrosion. Optionally as with the visually based simulated physical imperfections the plurality of available audio signatures may represent different auditory manifestations of a simulated physical imperfection such as noise of a substantially fixed frequency but with different magnitudes or a noise with a base component e.g. frequency cycle amplitude etc. .

The method in may further include the acts of selecting another audio signature corresponding to the same or another predetermined simulated physical imperfection from a plurality of available audio signatures to supplement or replace the previously selected audio signature A and associating the another selected audio signature with video image data comprising video images for the same simulated moving element or for another simulated moving element A . This association may then be saved in act A in a computer readable medium.

As with the methods described in relation to the examples of the acts depicted by way of example in may be performed in accord with a schedule following an occurrence of a predetermined event a manual input randomly a lapse of time a state of an adjacent wagering game machine an introduction of a player identifier and or a counter related to a duration of wagering game play for the wagering game machine.

In yet another aspect of the present concepts a gaming system is configured to provide a trusted gaming environment for wagering games and comprises a controller configured to conduct a wagering game and to render simulated mechanical reels within the wagering game in 3 D the simulated mechanical reels displaying images indicating a randomly selected outcome of the wagering game. The gaming system also includes one or more memory devices bearing executable instructions configured to render on a video display of a wagering game machine simulated mechanical reels within the wagering game and to randomly introduce at least one predetermined simulated physical imperfection to the simulated mechanical reels. As described above the predetermined simulated physical imperfection s is are randomly selected from one of a plurality of different available simulated physical imperfections or a plurality of different manifestations e.g. severity appearance size location characteristics etc. of or more simulated physical imperfections. Advantageously the executable instructions are further configured to cause the controller to track a duration of any simulated physical imperfection s to permit for example time based modification of the simulated physical imperfection s such as to increase a degree of severity of a simulated physical imperfection over time.

A gaming system in accord with yet another aspect of the present concepts is configured to provide a trusted gaming environment for wagering games for a plurality of linked wagering game machines where n is any integer. This gaming system comprises a plurality of wagering game machines such as wagering game machine shown in each of the plurality of wagering game machines comprising a housing a video display e.g. and an audio system. At least one controller whether resident locally in one of the wagering game machines or remotely is configured to conduct a wagering game on each of the plurality of wagering game machines and to render one or more simulated mechanical movable mechanical elements e.g. mechanical reels etc. in 3 D within wagering games e.g. base wagering games bonus games secondary games progressive games etc. conducted on the wagering game machines the simulated mechanical reels displaying images indicating a randomly selected outcome of the wagering game. At least one memory which may be local or remote and which may be distributed bears a first executable instruction set configured for each of the wagering game machines to display a background screen and to render simulated movable mechanical elements e.g. mechanical reels etc. within the wagering game in 3 D. The executable instruction set is also configured to introduce at least one simulated physical imperfection to one or more of the simulated movable mechanical elements for each of the wagering game machines. The simulated physical imperfection is randomly selected from an available population of simulated physical imperfections at least one of which may optionally include a plurality of potential manifestations.

As with the previously described aspects of the present concepts the controller is optionally configured to change an assigned manifestation such as but not limited to a severity for any simulated physical imperfection at any of the wagering game machines in accord with a schedule an occurrence of a predetermined event a manual input randomly a lapse of time a state of an adjacent wagering game machine an introduction of a player identifier and or a counter monitoring some parameter of interest. For example the controller may be configured to track wagering inputs to each of the plurality of wagering game machines over a predetermined period of time and responsive to the tracked wagering inputs to change a simulated physical imperfection and or a manifestation of the simulated physical imperfection assigned to a wagering game machine to at least substantially correspond to a combination of simulated physical imperfection and or manifestation thereof for another of one of the wagering game machines having higher coin in.

As noted above it is preferred that the gaming machine be configured to generate 3 D effects and still more preferably to generate such 3 D effects in real time with a 3 D engine e.g. rendering on the fly . In one embodiment the 3 D virtual controls may be implemented using a game design package such as RenderWare Studio 2.0 running for example on one or more processors e.g. Intel or AMD chips etc. . In at least some aspects the gaming environment and moveable visual elements are generated in real time using a 3 D game engine e.g. game middleware and or 3 D engine e.g. graphics engine rendering engine such as but not limited to RenderWare developed and maintained by Criterion Software Electronic Arts EA any publicly available free or open source engines and commercial engines e.g. Unigine Power Render Dagor Engine 3 etc. or any other commercial or proprietary game engine currently existing or later developed. The concepts presented herein do not depend upon any particular application programming interface API . The term game engine is used herein for brevity to refer to both or either of a 3 D game engine and or a 3 D engine. The present concepts may also advantageously include a physics engine whether separately or as part of a game engine to realistically animate physical objects. Alternatively sequences of or images of the simulated mechanical objects e.g. mechanical reels on the display are pre generated or pre rendered in 2 D or 3 D wholly or in part and rather than being generated or rendered on the fly are displayed with the same effect. The simulated mechanical imperfections may moreover be separately rendered from the simulated mechanical objects and applied as for example a pre generated overlay.

While the present invention has been described with reference to one or more particular embodiments those skilled in the art will recognize that many changes may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Each of these embodiments and obvious variations thereof is contemplated as falling within the spirit and scope of the claimed invention which is set forth in the following claims.

For example although the present concepts are described in relation to simulated physical imperfections the present concepts include simulated characteristics that are not actual representations of imperfections but are rather simply randomized differences i.e. not imperfections that are utilized to differentiate wagering game machines from one another and to temper the sameness of video based wagering game machines. Further the randomized differences need not occur during or in association with the wagering games themselves and may occur in an attract mode. For example in a western themed game one wagering game machine may be configured to display in the attract mode a randomized characteristic of oil dripping down the display whereas another wagering game machine may be configured to display a bullet hole in the display and another wagering game machine may be configured to display a shell casing at the bottom of the display. These configurations may optionally be retained upon activation of the wagering game machine by a player until such time as the controller alters the configuration of the wagering game machine as noted above to randomly change the simulated physical characteristics.
