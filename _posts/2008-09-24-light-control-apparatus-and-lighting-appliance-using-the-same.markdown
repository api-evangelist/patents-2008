The present invention relates to a light control apparatus for lighting an organic electroluminescence device and a lighting appliance using the same.

In recent years an organic electroluminescence Organic Electro Luminescence it is called organic EL device attracts attention as a light emitting device. The organic electroluminescence device hereinafter it is abbreviated as organic EL device has a characteristic of superior response because a time from start up of power distribution to light emission is very short and brightness instantly varies by varying electric current. In addition the organic EL device has characteristics that the response hardly varies with temperature and an angle of field of view thereof is near to 180 degrees. Due to these characteristics the organic EL device is suitable to surface emission and thus it is utilized to a lighting appliance such as a backlight of a liquid crystal display apparatus recently.

As for a light control apparatus for the organic El device one having light control function to control the brightness brilliance of the organic EL device is proposed as described in JP2006 210848A or JP2004 245904A for example. shows a circuit diagram of a lighting appliance which comprises a light source consisting of an organic EL device and a light control apparatus for lighting the light source . The light control apparatus feeds a constant electric current of a predetermined value to the light source consisting of the organic EL device and comprises a rectification circuit consisting of a diode bridge to perform full wave rectification to an alternating electric current which is an output of an alternator AC such as a commercial power source a power factor correction circuit unit hereinafter it is abbreviated as PFC circuit which converts the alternating electric current output performed the full wave rectification by the rectification circuit to a direct electric current output an electric current output circuit which outputs a constant electric current for lighting the light source on the basis of the direct electric current output from the PFC circuit and a light control circuit which performs light control of the light source by intermittently feeding the constant electric current outputted from the electric current output circuit to the light source .

The PFC circuit has a coil a choke coil L an end of which is connected to an output terminal of a high electric potential side of the rectification circuit . A series circuit of a switching element Q such as a MOSFET of n channel type and a resistor R is set between another end of the coil L and an output terminal of a low electric potential side of the rectification circuit . An anode of a diode D for preventing counter electric current is connected to a connection point of the coil L and the switching element Q. A smoothing capacitor C such as an electrolytic capacitor is set between a cathode of the diode D and the output terminal of the low electric potential side of the rectification circuit .

In such PFC circuit when switching on the switching element Q an electric current flows from the output terminal of the high electric potential side of the rectification circuit through the coil L and the switching element Q so that an energy is accumulated in the coil L. Subsequently when switching off the switching element Q the energy accumulated in the coil L is supplied to the smoothing capacitor C through the diode D. By repeating switching on and off of the switching element Q feeding and cutting off of the electric current to the capacitor C is repeated. By performing the on off control of the switching element Q with a high frequency a voltage between both terminals of the capacitor C can be set to a desired value.

The switching element Q is ON OFF controlled by a PFC control unit . The PFC control unit detects presence or absence of an electric current flowing in the coil L by a coil L and detects a source voltage of the switching element Q and performs the ON OFF control of the switching element Q based on the detected value of the electric current so as to maintain the voltage between the both terminals of the capacitor C constant. In addition the PFC control unit comprises a power factor correction function to correct distortion of harmonic component of the electric current obtained from the alternator AC and sets an ON term of the switching element Q to correct the power factor of input of the alternator AC for example.

The electric current output circuit is a depression chopper circuit which depresses a voltage of the direct electric current output of the PFC circuit and comprises a switching element Q such as a MOSFET of n channel type a drain of which is connected to the high electric potential side of the smoothing capacitor C of the PFC circuit a coil L an end of which is connected to a source of the switching element Q a diode D for backflow an anode of which is connected to the low electric potential side of the smoothing capacitor C a smoothing capacitor C such as an electrolytic capacitor connected to another end of the coil L a resistor R set between the low electric potential side of the capacitor C and an anode of the diode D and an electric current control circuit which performs ON OFF control of the switching element Q. By performing the ON OFF control of the switching element Q the electric current output circuit can set a voltage between both ends of the capacitor C that is the voltage applied to both ends of the light source to a desired value. The electric current control circuit performs the ON OFF control of the switching element Q based on a voltage between both ends of the resistor R so as to make the voltage between the both ends of the smoothing capacitor C constant and thus the electric current output circuit outputs a constant electric current to the light source . The electric current output circuit and the electric current control circuit constitute a constant current source.

The light control circuit is configured of a switching element Q such as a MOSFET of n channel type a drain of which is connected to a high electric potential side of the capacitor C of the electric current output circuit and a light control unit which performs the ON OFF control of the switching element Q. The light control unit performs the ON OFF control of the switching element Q in a high frequency by applying voltages to a gate of the switching element Q as shown in based on a given duty ratio. Consequently electric currents are intermittently outputted to the light source as shown in so that light control of the light source is performed.

By the way an equivalent circuit of the organic EL device which is the light source is represented by a parallel circuit of a diode and a capacitor. In other words the organic El device is a capacitive load having a capacitive component. Therefore when feeding of electric power to the light source is started by switching on the switching element Q in the light control apparatus of the conventional case a surge electric current a charge electric current flows in the organic EL device to charge the capacitive component of the organic EL device so that stress is given to the organic EL device hatched regions designated by symbols P in . In addition since the organic EL device does not emit light until the capacitive component is charged rising up of light flux outputted from the light source is delayed. On the other hand when the switching element Q is switched off and feeding of electric power to the light source is stopped electric charge accumulated in the capacitive component of the organic EL device is discharged hatched regions designated by symbols P in . Therefore a surge electric current flows to charge the capacitive component of the organic EL device again when the switching element Q is switched on subsequently.

In this way since charge and discharge of the capacitive component of the organic EL device serving as the light source are performed when the switching element Q is switched on and off electric power supplied to the light source is consumed wastefully and luminous efficiency becomes worse. Such problems are significant when the switching element Q is switched on and off in a high frequency.

The present invention is conceived to solve the above mentioned problems in the prior art and a purpose of the invention is to provide a light control apparatus and a lighting appliance using the same which enables to improve luminous efficiency in light control.

A light control apparatus in accordance with an aspect of the present invention comprises an electric current output circuit which outputs a constant electric current for lighting a light source configured of an organic electroluminescence device and an electric current control circuit for controlling an intensity of a driving electric current outputted from the electric current output circuit wherein

the electric current control circuit biases a direct electric current component so that the driving electric current periodically varies between a predetermined maximum value and a predetermined minimum value and flows in the same direction at all times in light control of the light source.

In addition a lighting appliance in accordance with an aspect of the present invention comprises the above light control apparatus and a light source configured of an organic electroluminescence device.

According to such configurations since the driving electric current flows in the same direction at all times to the light source that is the organic EL device in the light control when a capacitive component of the organic EL device is once charged it is never discharged until the completion of the light control and thus loss of electric power supplied to the light source becomes small and luminous efficiency can be increased. In addition since charge and discharge to the organic EL device are not performed in the light control the luminous efficiency thereof can be increased. Moreover since the light source is never extinguished in the light control the brightness of the organic EL device immediately varies responding to the variation of the driving electric current and thus rising up of light flux of the light source can be made precipitous brightness of light emission of the lighting appliance using this light control apparatus can be increased and flicker of the light source can be decreased. Moreover surge electric currents due to charge and discharge of the capacitive component do not flow repeatedly in the organic EL device so that stress loaded on the organic EL device is reduced and an operation life of the light source can be elongated. Moreover since the light control of the light source is performed by periodically oscillating the driving electric current between the predetermined maximum value and the predetermined minimum value a circuit for PWM control such as a switch for switching on and off a feeding line between the electric current output circuit and the light source and a control unit for controlling the switch becomes unnecessary and thus it is possible to simplify a circuit configuration and to reduce a cost thereof.

A light control apparatus and a lighting appliance using the same in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention are described with reference to figures. is a perspective illustration showing an appearance of the lighting appliance and is a cross sectional illustration showing an inside constitution thereof. As shown in the figures the lighting appliance comprises a light source configured of an organic EL device a light control apparatus to control lighting of the light source and a casing for containing the light source and the light control apparatus .

The light source comprises a supporting board a transparent electrode formed on a first face lower face in the figure side of the supporting board a light emission layer formed on a surface lower face among the surfaces of the transparent electrode opposite to the supporting board a reflection electrode formed of a metal on a surface lower face among the surfaces of the light emission layer opposite to the transparent electrode and a sealing member provided to cover the transparent electrode the light emission layer and the reflection electrode from the first face lower face of the supporting board .

The supporting board is a flat shaped member for supporting the light emission layer and formed of a material having transparency to lights emitted from the light emission layer . As for the supporting board a transparent board such as a glass board is used. The transparent electrode is an electroconductive thin film formed of a material having transparency to the lights emitted from the light emission layer . As for the material of such transparent electrode a transparent conductive material such as ITO Indium Tin Oxide is used. The light emission layer is formed of an organic material of fluorescent material or an organic material including fluorescent material for example and comprises a positive hole injection layer a positive hole transportation layer an electron transportation layer and an electron injection layer are provided if necessary. The reflection electrode is an electroconductive thin film formed of a material which reflects the lights emitted from the light emission layer . As for the material of such reflection electrode aluminum aluminum lithium alloy or magnesium silver alloy is used for example.

By the way terminal portions not illustrated for feeding electric power are provided on the transparent electrode and the reflection electrode . The sealing member is air tightly attached to the first face lower face side of the supporting board with an adhesive or the like so that the terminal portions of the transparent electrode and the reflection electrode are exposed. The sealing member is formed to be a box shape a face of which is opened with an insulative material such as a glass and used to prevent deterioration of the light emission layer formed of the organic material due to influence of oxygen or humidity gradually.

In this way the light source is an organic EL device of a rectangular plate shape which is constituted by building up of the transparent electrode the light emission layer and the reflection electrode sequentially and when a predetermined voltage is applied between the transparent electrode and the reflection electrode through the terminal portions for feeding electric power generating electric potential difference lights are emitted from the light emission layer .

The lights emitted from the light emission layer toward the transparent electrode side pass through the transparent electrode subsequently enter into the supporting board pass through an inside of the supporting board and exit from a second face upper face side of the supporting board to outside of the supporting board . On the other hand the lights emitted from the light emission layer toward the reflection electrode side are reflected by the reflection electrode toward the transparent electrode side subsequently pass through the inside of the supporting board and exit from the upper face side of the supporting board to outside of the supporting board .

Considering manufacturing process of building up the transparent electrode the light emission layer and the reflection electrode sequentially and adhering the sealing member on the supporting board the light source is an organic EL device of single sided emission type in which the second face bottom face in the manufacturing process of the supporting board is light emitting face and the face upper face in the manufacturing process among the surfaces of the sealing member opposite to the supporting board is non light emission face and especially bottom emission type one which emits lights toward the bottom face of the supporting board .

The casing is constituted by a body of box shape a lower face of which is opened and a cover which is to be attached to the body to cover the opening of the lower face as shown in . The body and the cover are formed of aluminum for example. A window aperture from which the lights emitted from the light source exit to outside of the casing is formed on a ceiling of the body . In addition the window aperture is closed by a transparent cover which is formed of a material for example a glass having transparency to the lights emitted from the light source . The light source is adhered from the inside of the box shaped body so that the light emitting face the second face of the supporting board faces the transparent cover fitted to the window aperture . Thus an outer face of the transparent cover serves as a light emitting face of the casing . A printed circuit board of the light control apparatus is attached to an inner face of the cover and the cover is attached to the body in a manner so that the light control apparatus is disposed between the light source and the cover in an inner space of the body . In addition the light control apparatus and the light source are electrically connected by wire bonding or the like.

The light control apparatus in the first embodiment is constituted that electronic elements constituting a lighting circuit for controlling lighting of the light source are mounted on the printed circuit board and has a circuit constitution shown in for example. The circuit constitution of the light control apparatus is described below with reference to to .

The light control apparatus in the first embodiment has a rectification circuit a PFC circuit an electric current output circuit and an electric current control circuit however it is different from the above mentioned conventional one in terms of not having a light control circuit and constituted to flow an electric current to the light source directly from the electric current output circuit . In addition since constitutions of the rectification circuit and the PFC circuit are the same as those of the conventional ones description of them is omitted.

As shown in the electric current control circuit is constituted by a driving circuit driving IC which performs ON OFF control of a switching element Q a processing unit for controlling the driving circuit by outputting driving signals to the driving circuit and a voltage dividing circuit which is constituted by a series circuit of a resistor R and a resistor R for detecting a voltage between both ends of a capacitor C.

The driving circuit varies a voltage between both ends of a capacitor C that is an intensity of a driving electric current outputted from the electric current output circuit by performing the PWM control of a switching element Q. A duty ratio of the switching element Q is defined by the intensity a voltage of a signal of the driving electric current outputted from the processing unit . In addition a switching frequency of the switching element Q is set to be several tens kHz.

The processing unit monitors the voltage that is the driving electric current between both ends of the resistor R through which the driving electric current flows in the electric current output circuit and outputs the driving signals to the driving circuit so that the voltage between both ends of the resistor R becomes a predetermined value.

The processing unit has a light control function for performing light control of the light source by oscillating the driving current to be a value that a minimum value thereof becomes higher than 0 even when it shows the minimum value in other words by oscillating sinusoidal waves or rectangular waves to be biased a direct current component. Specifically the processing unit outputs the driving signals to the driving circuit to appear a term t and a term t during which the duty ratio of the switching element Q becomes w and w alternately as shown in . Hereupon the voltage between both ends of the resistor R becomes a voltage V in the term t and the voltage between both ends of the resistor R becomes a voltage V in the term t as shown in . In other words the voltage V corresponds to a biasing direct current component.

The maximum value I of the driving electric current shown in is defined by a value of the resistor R and the voltage V and it is selected to be about 0.3 A as an example which is a value not to give any stress to not to affect the operative life of the organic EL device of the light source . In addition the minimum value I I

The electric current control circuit controls the electric current output circuit so that waveforms of the driving electric current outputted from the electric current output circuit become rectangular waves of a type that the term t during which the driving electric current becomes the maximum value I and the term t during which the driving electric current becomes the minimum value I appear alternately as shown in . Hereupon a period of the driving electric current is given by t t and a frequency 1 t t thereof is preferably several hundred Hz more preferably 200 Hz .

The processing unit adjusts lengths or a ratio of the terms t and t so as not to vary the frequency of the driving electric current to satisfy a condition t t constant responding to light control signals inputted from an external apparatus not illustrated such as a remote controller or an adjuster. For example when a light control signal to increase the brightness of the light source is inputted the processing unit lengthens the term t and shortens the term t than before. Alternatively when a light control signal to decrease the brightness of the light source is inputted the processing unit shortens the term t and lengthens the term t than before.

Subsequently an operation of the light control apparatus in the first embodiment is described. When the light control apparatus starts the operation the electric current control circuit controls the electric current output circuit so that the maximum value I and the minimum value I of the driving electric current and the terms t and t become predetermined values respectively and thus the light source is lit at a brightness responding to a mean value of the driving electric current outputted from the electric current output circuit . When a light control signal to increase the brightness of the light source is inputted to the electric current control circuit from an external apparatus the electric current control circuit increases the mean value of the driving electric current by lengthening the term t and shortening the term t than before so as to light the light source brightly. On the other hand when a light control signal to decrease the brightness of the light source is inputted to the electric current control circuit from the external apparatus the electric current control circuit decreases the mean value of the driving electric current by shortening the term t and lengthening the term t than before so as to light the light source darkly.

In this way according to the light control apparatus in the first embodiment the driving electric current of a component of the electric current I due to the biasing direct current voltage V flows in the light source at all times in the light control of the light source as shown in feeding of the electric power to the light source is never stopped different from the case of performing the light control of the light source by the PWM control like the conventional one. Therefore when a capacitive component of the organic EL device is once charged charge and discharge to the organic EL device are not performed in the light control different from the conventional one so that luminous efficiency can be increased. In addition the light source is never extinguished in the light control the brightness of the organic EL device immediately varies responding to the variation of the driving electric current so that rising up of light flux of the light source can be made precipitous brightness of light emission of the lighting appliance using this light control apparatus can be increased and flicker of the light source can be decreased. Moreover surge electric currents due to charge and discharge of the capacitive component do not flow repeatedly in the organic EL device so that stress loaded on the organic EL device is reduced and an operation life of the light source can be elongated. Moreover the light control of the light source is performed by oscillating the driving electric current so that a circuit for PWM control such as a switch for switching on and off of a feeding line between the electric current output circuit and the light source and a control unit for example a light control circuit in for controlling the switch becomes unnecessary and thus it is possible to simplify a circuit configuration and to reduce a cost thereof.

In addition although the processing unit in the first embodiment is configured to adjust the terms t and t so as not to vary the frequency of the driving electric current to satisfy the condition t t constant it is not necessarily to make the frequency of the driving electric current constant. For example when the light control signal to increase the brightness of the light source is inputted it is possible to lengthen only the term t and to remain the term t as it is or to shorten only the term t and to remain the term t as it is. Alternatively it is possible to lengthen the term t and to shorten the term t without satisfying the condition t t constant. In addition when the light control signal to decrease the brightness of the light source is inputted it is possible to shorten only the term t or to lengthen only the term t or to shorten the term t and to lengthen the term t simultaneously. In other words it is sufficient that the electric current control circuit is configured to vary the length of at least one of the term t during which the driving electric current becomes the maximum value I and the tern t during which the driving electric current becomes the minimum value I in one period of an amplitude of the driving electric current.

In addition it is possible to perform the light control of the light source by varying at least one of the maximum value I and the minimum value I of the driving electric current instead of varying at least one of the terms t and t in one period of the amplitude of the driving electric current. For example it is possible to increase the maximum value I and the minimum value I of the driving electric current when the light control signal to increase the brightness of the light source is inputted and to decrease the maximum value I and the minimum value I of the driving electric current when the light control signal to decrease the brightness of the light source is inputted.

In addition it is not necessary to vary both of the maximum value I and the minimum value I of the driving electric current and it is preferable to vary at least one of the maximum value I and the minimum value I. For example the processing unit may be configured so that the maximum value I of the driving electric current is set to a constant value and the minimum value I is increased when the light control signal to increase the brightness of the light source is inputted and the minimum value I is decreased when the light control signal to decrease the brightness of the light source is inputted. Alternatively the processing unit may be configured so that the minimum value I of the driving electric current is set to a constant value and the maximum value I is increased when the light control signal to increase the brightness of the light source is inputted and the maximum value I is decreased when the light control signal to decrease the brightness of the light source is inputted. In other words the electric current control apparatus may be one that varies at least one of the maximum value I and the minimum value I of the driving electric current to perform the light control of the light source .

Alternatively the electric current control circuit may be configured to vary both of the lengths or ratio of the term t and the term t during which the driving electric current becomes the maximum value I and the minimum value I and the maximum value I and or the minimum value I of the driving electric current for light control of the light source .

In summary the electric current control circuit may be configured to perform the light control of the light source by adjusting at least one of four parameters of the term t during which the driving electric current becomes the maximum value I the term t during which the driving electric current becomes the minimum value I the maximum value I of the driving electric current and the minimum value I of the driving electric current.

In addition although the depression chopper circuit is exemplified for the electric current output circuit the electric current output circuit is not limited to the depression chopper circuit a direct electric current source which enables to flow an electric current of a predetermined intensity to the light source may be used. In addition the lighting appliance shown in is an embodiment of the present invention and it is not intended to limit the present invention to the embodiment and modification may be acceptable in a scope not to divagate the gist of the present invention. The same goes for a second embodiment described below.

Subsequently a light control apparatus and a lighting appliance using the same in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention are described. In the second embodiment configurations of an electric current output circuit and as electric current control circuit are different from those in the first embodiment as shown in and . The other constitution is the same as that in the first embodiment the same elements are designated by the same symbols and thus the description of them is omitted.

The electric current output circuit in the second embodiment does not comprise a smoothing capacitor . In addition the electric current control circuit is constituted by a control circuit unit for performing ON OFF control of a switching element Q and a processing unit . The control circuit unit is constituted by a comparator circuit configured of a pair of a first comparator COPM and a second comparator COMP a logic circuit configured of an SR type flip flop circuit such as a pair of NOR gates and a driving circuit for switching on and off the switching element Q responding to outputs from the logic circuit

A noninversion input terminal of the first comparator COMP of the comparator circuit is connected to a point between a resistor R and a light source and a voltage between both ends of the resistor R is inputted to the noninversion input terminal. An inversion input terminal of the first comparator COMP is connected to the processing unit and a voltage V which is an upper limit of the voltage between both ends of the resistor R is inputted to the inversion input terminal from the processing unit . Thus the first comparator COMP outputs a high level signal when the voltage between both ends of the resistor R exceeds the voltage V. On the other hand an inversion input terminal of the second comparator COMP is connected to the point between the resistor R and the light source and the voltage between both ends of the resistor R is inputted to the inversion input terminal. A noninversion input terminal of the second comparator COMP is connected to the processing unit and a voltage V 0 which is a lower limit of the voltage between both ends of the resistor R is inputted thereto from the processing unit . Thus the second comparator COMP outputs a high level signal when the voltage between both ends of the resistor R falls short of the voltage V.

The logic circuit is the SR type flip flop circuit as mentioned above and has a truth table shown in table 1.

A set terminal S terminal of the logic circuit is connected to an output terminal of the second comparator COMP of the comparator circuit a reset terminal R terminal is connected to an output terminal of the first comparator COMP of the comparator circuit and an output terminal Q terminal is connected to the driving circuit

The driving circuit outputs a high level signal to a gate of the switching element Q when the truth value of the output terminal is 1 so as to switch on the switching element Q. In addition the driving circuit outputs a low level signal to the gate of the switching element Q when the truth value of the output terminal is 0 so as to switch off the switching element Q.

Subsequently a motion of the control circuit unit is described with reference to . shows a variation of a driving electric current flowing shows a variation of the voltage between both ends of the resistor R shows a variation of the output of the first comparator COMP shows a variation of the output of the second comparator COMP and shows a variation of the gate voltage of the switching element Q.

At first it is assumed that the voltage between both ends of the resistor R is a value larger than the lower limit value V and smaller than the upper limit value V in an initial state as shown in and the switching element Q is switched off. In case that the switching element Q is switched off no driving electric current flows to the light source and the voltage between both ends of the resistor R degreases in time as shown in . Later on when the voltage between both ends of the resistor R falls short of the lower limit value V the output of the second comparator COMP becomes high level as shown in and a truth value 1 is inputted to the set terminal of the logic circuit . At this time since the output of the first comparator COMP is low level as shown in the output of the output terminal of the logic circuit becomes the truth value 1 and thus the driving circuit outputs a high level signal to the gate of the switching element Q so as to switch on the switching element Q as shown in . Thereby the value of the driving electric current flowing in the light source increases as shown in and the voltage between both ends of the resistor R increases as shown in . Hereupon since the electric current output circuit comprises a coil L the driving electric current does not increase precipitous even when the switching element Q is switched on and thus it gradually increases. In addition when the voltage between both ends of the resistor R exceeds the lower limit value V the output of the second comparator COMP becomes low level however the output of the output terminal of the logic circuit is remained as the truth value 1 as shown in the table 1.

When the voltage between both ends of the resistor R increases and exceeds the upper limit value V the output of the first comparator COMP becomes high level as shown in and the truth value 1 is inputted to the reset terminal of the logic circuit . At this time since the output of the second comparator COMP is low level as shown in the output of the output terminal of the logic circuit becomes the truth value 0 and thus the driving circuit outputs a low level signal to the gate of the switching element Q so as to switch off the switching element Q as shown in . Thereby the value of the driving electric current flowing in the light source decreases as shown in and the voltage between both ends of the resistor R decreases. Since the electric current output circuit comprises the coil L as mentioned above the driving electric current does not decrease precipitous even when the switching element Q is switched off and thus it gradually decreases. In addition when the voltage between both ends of the resistor R falls short of the upper limit value V the output of the first comparator COMP becomes low level however the output of the output terminal of the logic circuit is remained as the truth value 0 as shown in the table 1.

Subsequently by repeating the operations that the switching element Q is switched on when the voltage between both ends of the resistor R falls short of the lower limit value V and the switching element Q is switched on when the voltage between both ends of the resistor R exceeds the upper limit value V waveforms of the voltage between both ends of the resistor R become pyramidal waves that the upper limit value V and the lower limit value V appear alternately as shown in .

Therefore waveforms of the driving electric current flowing in the light source become pyramidal waves that a value I of electric current when the voltage between both ends of the resistor R is the upper limit value V and a value I of electric current when the voltage between both ends of the resistor R is the lower limit value V appear alternately as shown in . Hereupon the value I of electric current is the maximum value of the driving electric current defined by the value of the resistor R and the upper limit value V of the voltage between both ends thereof and it is selected to be about 0.3 A as an example which is a value not to give any stress to not to affect the operative life of the light source . On the other hand the value I of electric current I

By the way when a term that the driving electric current is transitive to the minimum value I from the maximum value I is designated by t and a term that the driving electric current is transitive to the maximum value I from the minimum value I is designated by t a period of the driving electric current is given by t t and a frequency 1 t t is preferably several hundred Hz more preferably 200 Hz .

The processing unit performs the light control of the light source by adjusting intensities the upper limit value V and the lower limit value V of the voltage of both ends of the resistor R responding to light control signals inputted from an external apparatus not illustrated such as a remote controller or an adjuster. For example when a light control signal to increase the brightness of the light source is inputted the processing unit increases both of the upper limit value V and the lower limit value V of the voltage between both ends of the resistor R than before so as to increase both of the maximum value I and the minimum value I of the driving electric current. On the other hand when a light control signal to decrease the brightness of the light source is inputted the processing unit decreases both of the upper limit value V and the lower limit value V of the voltage between both ends of the resistor R than before so as to decrease both of the maximum value I and the minimum value I of the driving electric current.

Subsequently an operation of the light control apparatus in the second embodiment is described. When the light control apparatus starts the operation the electric current control circuit controls the electric current output circuit so that the maximum value I and the minimum value I of the driving electric current become predetermined values respectively and thus the light source is lit at a brightness responding to a mean value of the driving electric current outputted from the electric current output circuit . When a light control signal to increase the brightness of the light source is inputted to the electric current control circuit from an external apparatus the electric current control circuit increases both of the maximum value I and the minimum value I of the driving electric current than the values before so as to increase the mean value of the driving electric current and thus to lit the light source brightly than before. On the other hand when a light control signal to decrease the brightness of the light source is inputted to the electric current control circuit from the external apparatus the electric current control circuit decreases both of the maximum value I and the minimum value I of the driving electric current than the values before so as to decrease the mean value of the driving electric current and thus to lit the light source darkly than before.

In this way according to the light control apparatus and a lighting appliance using the light control apparatus in the second embodiment the driving electric current flows in the light source at all times in the light control so that it works on the same effect as the above mentioned first embodiment.

By the way although the electric current control circuit in the second embodiment is configured to perform the light control of the light source by varying the maximum value I and the minimum value I of the driving electric current it is not necessary to vary both of the maximum value I and the minimum value I and at least one of the maximum value I and the minimum value I should be varied. For example the electric current control circuit may be configured to set the maximum value I as a fixed vale to increase only the minimum value I of the driving electric current when the light control signal to increase the brightness of the light source is inputted and to decrease only the minimum value I of the driving electric current when the light control signal to decrease the brightness of the light source is inputted. Alternatively the electric current control circuit may be configured to set the minimum value I as a fixed vale to increase only the maximum value I of the driving electric current when the light control signal to increase the brightness of the light source is inputted and to decrease only the maximum value I of the driving electric current when the light control signal to decrease the brightness of the light source is inputted. In other words the electric current control circuit may be configured to fix one of the maximum value I and the minimum value I of the driving electric current and to vary the other.

In addition the electric current control circuit may be configured to perform the light control of the light source by varying the term t that the driving electric current is transitive to the minimum value I from the maximum value I and the term t that the driving electric current is transitive to the maximum value I from the minimum value I instead of varying the intensity of the driving electric current. For example when the light control signal to increase the brightness of the light source is inputted the electric current control circuit shortens at least one of the term t and the term t to shorten the period t t of the driving electric current and when the light control signal to decrease the brightness of the light source is inputted the electric current control circuit lengthens at least one of the term t and the term t to lengthen the period t t of the driving electric current. In other words the electric current control circuit may be configured to vary at least one of the term t that the driving electric current is transitive to the minimum value I from the maximum value I and the term t that the driving electric current is transitive to the maximum value I from the minimum value I in light control of the light source .

Alternatively the electric current control circuit may be configured to vary at least one of the term t that the driving electric current is transitive to the minimum value I from the maximum value I and the term t that the driving electric current is transitive to the maximum value I from the minimum value I and at least one of the maximum value I and the minimum value I of the driving electric current simultaneously in light control of the light source .

In summary the electric current control circuit may be configured to perform the light control of the light source by adjusting at least one of four parameters of the term t that the driving electric current is transitive to the minimum value I from the maximum value I the term t that the driving electric current is transitive to the maximum value I from the minimum value I and the maximum value I and the minimum value I of the driving electric current.
