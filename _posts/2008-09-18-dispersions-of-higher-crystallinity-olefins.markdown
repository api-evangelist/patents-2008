Aqueous dispersions of a thermoplastic resin of various types are known in the art and have been used in a wide variety of fields. For example when an aqueous dispersion is coated and dried on a surface of a substrate such as paper fiber wood metal or plastic molded article the resin coating formed will provide the substrate with water resistance oil resistance chemical resistance corrosion resistance and heat sealability. An aqueous medium is advantageous compared to an organic dispersion medium in view of common hazards such as flammability working environment handling convenience and the like.

Conventional aqueous dispersions of a thermoplastic resin have been produced either by a process wherein a polymerizable monomer which is the resin raw material is polymerized by emulsion polymerization in an aqueous medium in the presence of a dispersing agent or by a process wherein a molten thermoplastic resin and an aqueous medium and optionally a dispersing agent are mixed by applying shearing force.

Until the advent of polyolefin dispersions polyolefins were typically limited to extrusion and coextrusion processes and thus polyolefins could not be used in coating processes such as paper coating fabric coating and the like nor in very thin layers e.g. less than 15 microns.

Newer polyolefin dispersions have provided improved performance but the useful polyolefin dispersions have been limited to those with lower crystallinities such as ethylene and propylene elastomers and plastomers.

In another aspect embodiments disclosed herein relate to a cellulose based article including a cellulose based composition and an applied compound wherein the applied compound at the time of application comprises an aqueous dispersion including a higher crystallinity polyolefin and at least one dispersing agent.

In another aspect embodiments disclosed herein relate to articles formed by a process including impregnating a fibrous structure with a compound the compound comprising an aqueous dispersion the dispersion comprising a higher crystallinity polyolefin and at least one dispersing agent removing at least a portion of the water from the impregnated fibrous structure.

As described above embodiments of the dispersions disclosed herein may include a polymeric component that may include at least one multi block olefin interpolymer. The following definitions are provided to distinguish a multi block olefin interpolymer from other olefin polymers.

The term multi block copolymer or segmented copolymer refers to a polymer comprising two or more chemically distinct regions or segments referred to as blocks preferably joined in a linear manner that is a polymer comprising chemically differentiated units which are joined end to end with respect to polymerized ethylenic functionality rather than in pendent or grafted fashion. In certain embodiments the blocks differ in the amount or type of comonomer incorporated therein the density the amount of crystallinity the crystallite size attributable to a polymer of such composition the type or degree of tacticity isotactic or syndiotactic regio regularity or regio irregularity the amount of branching including long chain branching or hyper branching the homogeneity or any other chemical or physical property.

The multi block copolymers are characterized by unique distributions of polydispersity index PDI or WM. block length distribution and or block number distribution due to the unique process making of the copolymers. More specifically when produced in a continuous process embodiments of the polymers may possess a PDI ranging from about 1.7 to about 8 from about 1.7 to about 3.5 in other embodiments from about 1.7 to about 2.5 in other embodiments and from about 1.8 to about 2.5 or from about 1.8 to about 2.1 in yet other embodiments.

One example of the multi block olefin interpolymer is an ethylene olefin block interpolymer. Another example of the multi block olefin interpolymer is a propylene olefin interpolymer. The following description focuses on the interpolymer as having ethylene as the majority monomer but applies in a similar fashion to propylene based multi block interpolymers with regard to general polymer characteristics.

The ethylene olefin multi block interpolymers hereinafter ethylene olefin interpolymer or variations thereof comprise ethylene and one or more co polymerizable olefin comonomers in polymerized form characterized by multiple i.e. two or more blocks or segments of two or more polymerized monomer units differing in chemical or physical properties block interpolymer preferably a multi block interpolymer. In some embodiments the multi block interpolymer may be represented by the following formula AB where n is at least 1 preferably an integer greater than 1 such as 2 3 4 5 10 15 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 or higher A represents a hard block or segment and B represents a soft block or segment. Preferably A s and B s are linked in a linear fashion not in a branched or a star fashion. Hard segments refer to blocks of polymerized units in which ethylene is present in an amount greater than 95 weight percent in some embodiments and in other embodiments greater than 98 weight percent. In other words the comonomer content in the hard segments is less than 5 weight percent in some embodiments and in other embodiments less than 2 weight percent of the total weight of the hard segments. In some embodiments the hard segments comprise all or substantially all ethylene. Soft segments on the other hand refer to blocks of polymerized units in which the comonomer content is greater than 5 weight percent of the total weight of the soft segments in some embodiments greater than 8 weight percent greater than 10 weight percent or greater than 15 weight percent in various other embodiments. In some embodiments the comonomer content in the soft segments may be greater than 20 weight percent greater than 25 eight percent greater than 30 weight percent greater than 35 weight percent greater than 40 weight percent greater than 45 weight percent greater than 50 weight percent or greater than 60 weight percent in various other embodiments.

In some embodiments A blocks and B blocks are randomly distributed along the polymer chain. In other words the block copolymers do not have a structure like AAA AA BBB BB

In other embodiments the block copolymers do not have a third block. In still other embodiments neither block A nor block B comprises two or more segments or sub blocks such as a tip segment.

The ethylene olefin interpolymers are characterized by an average block index ABI ranging from greater than zero to about 1.0 and a molecular weight distribution M Mgreater than about 1.3. The average block index ABI is the weight average of the block index BI for each of the polymer fractions obtained in preparative TREF temperature rising elution fractionation from 20 C. and 110 C. with an increment of 5 C. ABI BI where BIis the block index for the ifraction of the ethylene olefin interpolymer obtained in preparative TREF and w is the weight percentage of the ifraction.

Similarly the square root of the second moment about the mean hereinafter referred to as the second moment weight average block index may be defined as follows 

For each polymer fraction BI is defined by one of the two following equations both of which give the same BI value 

Tis the ATREF elution temperature for a random copolymer of the same composition having an ethylene mole fraction of P and molecular weight as the multi block interpolymer. Tmay be calculated from the mole fraction of ethylene measured by NMR using the following equation 

where and are two constants which may be determined by a calibration using a number of well characterized preparative TREF fractions of a broad composition random copolymer and or well characterized random ethylene copolymers with narrow composition. It should be noted that and may vary from instrument to instrument. Moreover one would need to create an appropriate calibration curve with the polymer composition of interest using appropriate molecular weight ranges and comonomer type for the preparative TREF fractions and or random copolymers used to create the calibration. There is a slight molecular weight effect. If the calibration curve is obtained from similar molecular weight ranges such effect would be essentially negligible. In some embodiments random ethylene copolymers and or preparative TREF fractions of random copolymers satisfy the following relationship Ln 237.83 0.639

The above calibration equation relates the mole fraction of ethylene P to the analytical TREF elution temperature T for narrow composition random copolymers and or preparative TREF fractions of broad composition random copolymers. Tis the ATREF temperature for a random copolymer of the same composition and having an ethylene mole fraction of P. Tmay be calculated from LnP T Conversely Pis the ethylene mole fraction for a random copolymer of the same composition and having an ATREF temperature of T which may be calculated from Ln P T .

Once the block index BI for each preparative TREF fraction is obtained the weight average block index ABI for the whole polymer may be calculated. In some embodiments ABI is greater than zero but less than about 0.4 or from about 0.1 to about 0.3. In other embodiments ABI is greater than about 0.4 and up to about 1.0. Preferably ABI should be in the range of from about 0.4 to about 0.7 from about 0.5 to about 0.7 or from about 0.6 to about 0.9. In some embodiments ABI is in the range of from about 0.3 to about 0.9 from about 0.3 to about 0.8 or from about 0.3 to about 0.7 from about 0.3 to about 0.6 from about 0.3 to about 0.5 or from about 0.3 to about 0.4. In other embodiments ABI is in the range of from about 0.4 to about 1.0 from about 0.5 to about 1.0 or from about 0.6 to about 1.0 from about 0.7 to about 1.0 from about 0.8 to about 1.0 or from about 0.9 to about 1.0.

Another characteristic of the ethylene olefin interpolymer is that the ethylene olefin interpolymer comprises at least one polymer fraction which may be obtained by preparative TREF wherein the fraction has a block index greater than about 0.1 and up to about 1.0 and the polymer having a molecular weight distribution M M greater than about 1.3. In some embodiments the polymer fraction has a block index greater than about 0.6 and up to about 1.0 greater than about 0.7 and up to about 1.0 greater than about 0.8 and up to about 1.0 or greater than about 0.9 and up to about 1.0. In other embodiments the polymer fraction has a block index greater than about 0.1 and up to about 1.0 greater than about 0.2 and up to about 1.0 greater than about 0.3 and up to about 1.0 greater than about 0.4 and up to about 1.0 or greater than about 0.4 and up to about 1.0. In still other embodiments the polymer fraction has a block index greater than about 0.1 and up to about 0.5 greater than about 0.2 and up to about 0.5 greater than about 0.3 and up to about 0.5 or greater than about 0.4 and up to about 0.5. In yet other embodiments the polymer fraction has a block index greater than about 0.2 and up to about 0.9 greater than about 0.3 and up to about 0.8 greater than about 0.4 and up to about 0.7 or greater than about 0.5 and up to about 0.6.

Embodiments of the present invention use a dispersing agent or stabilizing agent to promote the formation of a stable dispersion or emulsion. In selected embodiments the stabilizing agent may be a surfactant a polymer different from the base polymer detailed above or mixtures thereof. In certain embodiments the polymer may be a polar polymer having a polar group as either a comonomer or grafted monomer. In preferred embodiments the stabilizing agent comprises one or more polar polyolefins having a polar group as either a comonomer or grafted monomer. For example the dispersing agent may include an ethylene alpha beta unsaturated carboxylic acid copolymer. In some embodiments the ethylene alpha beta unsaturated carboxylic acid copolymer may include an ethylene acid copolymer such as an ethylene acrylic acid copolymer or an ethylene methacrylic acid copolymer.

Typical polymers include ethylene acrylic acid EAA and ethylene methacrylic acid copolymers such as those available under the trademarks PRIMACOR trademark of The Dow Chemical Company NUCREL trademark of E.I. DuPont de Nemours and ESCOR trademark of ExxonMobil and described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 599 392 4 988 781 and 5 938 437 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Other polymers include ethylene ethyl acrylate EEA copolymer ethylene methyl methacrylate EMMA and ethylene butyl acrylate EBA . Other ethylene carboxylic acid copolymer may also be used. Those having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that a number of other useful polymers may also be used.

Other surfactants that may be used include long chain fatty acids or fatty acid salts having from 12 to 60 carbon atoms. In other embodiments the long chain fatty acid or fatty acid salt may have from 12 to 40 carbon atoms.

If the polar group of the polymer is acidic or basic in nature the stabilizing polymer may be partially or fully neutralized with a neutralizing agent to form the corresponding salt. In certain embodiments neutralization of the stabilizing agent such as a long chain fatty acid or EAA may be from 25 to 200 on a molar basis from 50 to 110 on a molar basis in other embodiments. For example for EAA the neutralizing agent is a base such as ammonium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide for example. Other neutralizing agents may include lithium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide for example. Those having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the selection of an appropriate neutralizing agent depends on the specific composition formulated and that such a choice is within the knowledge of those of ordinary skill in the art.

Additional surfactants that may be useful in the practice of the present invention include cationic surfactants anionic surfactants zwitterionic or non ionic surfactants. Examples of anionic surfactants include sulfonates carboxylates and phosphates. Examples of cationic surfactants include quaternary amines. Examples of non ionic surfactants include block copolymers containing ethylene oxide and silicone surfactants. Surfactants useful in the practice of the present invention may be either external surfactants or internal surfactants. External surfactants are surfactants that do not become chemically reacted into the polymer during dispersion preparation. Examples of external surfactants useful herein include salts of dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid and lauryl sulfonic acid salt. Internal surfactants are surfactants that do become chemically reacted into the polymer during dispersion preparation. An example of an internal surfactant useful herein includes 2 2 dimethylol propionic acid and its salts.

In particular embodiments the dispersing agent or stabilizing agent may be used in an amount ranging from greater than zero to about 60 by weight based on the amount of base polymer or base polymer mixture used. For example long chain fatty acids or salts thereof may be used in an amount ranging from 0.5 to 10 by weight based on the amount of base polymer. In other embodiments ethylene acrylic acid or ethylene methacrylic acid copolymers may be used in an amount from 0.5 to 60 by weight based on polymer. In yet other embodiments sulfonic acid salts may be used in an amount from 0.5 to 10 by weight based on the amount of base polymer.

The type and amount of stabilizing agent used may also affect end properties of the cellulose based article formed incorporating the dispersion. For example articles having improved oil and grease resistance might incorporate a surfactant package having ethylene acrylic acid copolymers or ethylene methacrylic acid copolymers in an amount from about 10 to about 50 by weight based on the total amount of base polymer. A similar surfactant package may be used when improved strength or softness is a desired end property. As another example articles having improved water or moisture resistance might incorporate a surfactant package utilizing long chain fatty acids in an amount from 0.5 to 5 or ethylene acrylic acid copolymers in an amount from 10 to 50 both by weight based on the total amount of base polymer. In other embodiments the minimum amount of surfactant or stabilizing agent must be at least 1 by weight based on the total amount of base polymer.

Additives may be used with the base polymer dispersing agent or filler used in the dispersion without deviating from the scope of the present invention. For example additives may include a wetting agent surfactants anti static agents antifoam agent anti block wax dispersion pigments a neutralizing agent a thickener a compatibilizer a brightener a rheology modifier a biocide a fungicide a shear stabilizer a UV stabilizer a coefficient of friction modifier and other additives known to those skilled in the art.

For example a formulation of the present invention may include surfactants frothing agents dispersants thickeners fire retardants pigments antistatic agents reinforcing fibers antifoam agent anti block wax dispersion antioxidants a neutralizing agent a rheology modifier preservatives biocides acid scavengers a wetting agent and the like. While optional for purposes of the present invention other components may be highly advantageous for product stability during and after the manufacturing process.

In addition embodiments of the present invention optionally include a filler wetting agent. A filler wetting agent generally may help make the filler and the polyolefin dispersion more compatible. Useful wetting agents include phosphate salts such as sodium hexametaphosphate. A filler wetting agent may be included in a composition of the present invention at a concentration of at least about 0.5 parts per 100 parts of filler by weight.

Furthermore embodiments of the present invention may optionally include a thickener. Thickeners may be useful in the present invention to increase the viscosity of low viscosity dispersions. Thickeners suitable for use in the practice of the present invention may be any known in the art such as for instance poly acrylate type or associate non ionic thickeners such as modified cellulose ethers. For example suitable thickeners include ALCOGUM VEP II trademark of Alco Chemical Corporation RHEOVIS and VISCALEX trademarks of Ciba Geigy UCAR Thickener 146 or ETHOCEL or METHOCEL trademarks of the The Dow Chemical Company and PARAGUM 241 trademarks of Para Chem Southern Inc. or BERMACOL trademark of Akzo Nobel or AQUALON trademark of Hercules or ACUSOL trademark of Rohm and Haas . Thickeners may be used in any amount necessary to prepare a dispersion of desired viscosity.

The ultimate viscosity of the dispersion is therefore controllable. Addition of the thickener to the dispersion including the amount of filler may be done with conventional means to result in viscosities as needed. Viscosities of thus dispersions may reach 3000 cP Brookfield spindle 4 with 20 rpm with moderate thickener dosing up to 4 preferably below 3 based on 100 phr of polymer dispersion . The starting polymer dispersion as described has an initial viscosity prior to formulation with fillers and additives between 20 cP and 1000 cP Brookfield viscosity measured at room temperature with spindle RV3 at 50 rpm . Still more preferably the starting viscosity of the dispersion may be between about 100 to about 600 cP.

Also embodiments of the present invention are characterized by their stability when a filler is added to the polymer stabilizing agent. In this context stability refers to the stability of viscosity of the resultant aqueous polyolefin dispersion. In order to test the stability the viscosity is measured over a period of time. Preferably viscosity measured at 20 C. should remain 10 of the original viscosity over a period of 24 hours when stored at ambient temperature.

Embodiments of the dispersions disclosed herein may include a filler as part of the composition. A suitable filler loading in a polyolefin dispersion may be from about 0 parts to about 600 parts of filler per hundred parts of polyolefin. In certain embodiments the filler loading in the dispersion may be from about 0 parts to about 200 parts of filler per hundred parts of a combined amount of the polyolefin and the dispersing agent.

The filler material may include conventional fillers such as milled glass calcium carbonate aluminum trihydrate talc antimony trioxide fly ash clays such as bentonite or kaolin clays for example titanium dioxide zeolites powdered metals organic or inorganic fibers including carbon fibers silicon nitride fibers steel wire or mesh and nylon or polyester cording nano sized particles tackifiers oil extenders including paraffinic or napthelenic oils other known fillers.

Those having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that a number of other neutralizing agents may be used. In some embodiments the filler may be added after blending the base polymer and dispersing agent. In some embodiments the dispersion is first diluted to contain about 1 to about 3 by weight water and then subsequently further diluted to comprise greater than about 25 by weight water.

Any melt kneading means known in the art may be used. In some embodiments a kneader a BANBURY mixer single screw extruder or a multi screw extruder is used. A process for producing the dispersions in accordance with the present invention is not particularly limited. One preferred process for example is a process comprising melt kneading the above mentioned components according to U.S. Pat. No. 5 756 659 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 455 636.

Referring now to a schematic diagram of an extrusion apparatus for manufacturing polymer dispersions is illustrated. An extruder such as a twin screw extruder may be coupled to a pressure control device such as but not limited a pressure control valve a back pressure regulator a melt pump a gear pump and the like. Neutralizing agent reservoir and an initial water reservoir each of which includes a pump not shown may also be provided. Desired amounts of neutralizing agent and initial water are provided from the neutralizing agent reservoir and the initial water reservoir respectively. Any suitable pump may be used but in some embodiments a pump that provides the desired flow at a pressure of 3480 psig 240 bar 24 MPag is used to provide the neutralizing agent and the initial water to the extruder . In other embodiments a liquid injection pump provides the required flow at 2900 psig 200 bar 20 MPag or at 1930 psig 133 bar 13.3 MPag . In some embodiments the neutralizing agent and initial water are preheated in a preheater.

Polymer resin s in the form of pellets powder or flakes for example may be fed from the feeder to an inlet of the extruder where the resin is melted or compounded. The dispersing agent is typically added to the extruder through and along with the resin but may be provided separately to the twin screw extruder . The resin melt is then delivered from the mix and convey zone to an emulsification zone of the extruder where the initial amount of water and neutralizing agent from the reservoirs and is added through inlet . The emulsified mixture may be further diluted with additional water via inlet from reservoir in a dilution and cooling zone of the extruder . Typically the dispersion is diluted to at least 30 weight percent water in the cooling zone.

In some embodiments dispersing agent may be added additionally or exclusively to the water stream. In some embodiments the emulsified mixture is further diluted with additional water inlet from reservoir in a dilution and cooling zone of the extruder . Typically the dispersion is diluted to at least 30 weight percent water in the cooling zone. In addition the diluted mixture may be diluted any number of times until the desired dilution level is achieved. In some embodiments water is not added into the twin screw extruder but rather to a stream containing the resin melt after the melt has exited from the extruder

Referring now to a schematic diagram of an extrusion system used in embodiments disclosed herein is illustrated. An extruder such as a twin screw extruder may be coupled to a control valve for controlling extruder discharge pressure. In some embodiment control valve may be a V ball control valve. In other embodiments control valve may be a micro notch V ball control valve.

Neutralizing agent reservoir and an initial dispersion medium reservoir each of which includes a pump not shown may also be provided. Desired amounts of neutralizing agent and initial dispersion medium are provided from the neutralizing agent reservoir and the initial water reservoir respectively.

Polymer resin s in the form of pellets powder or flakes for example may be fed from the feeder to an inlet of the extruder . The dispersing agent is typically added to the extruder through and along with the resin but may be provided separately to the twin screw extruder . The polymer and dispersing agent are then melted mixed and conveyed by screws in mix and convey zone .

The resin melt is then delivered from the mix and convey zone to a high internal phase emulsion creation zone referred to herein as the HIPE zone of the extruder. In the HIPE zone an initial amount of dispersion medium and neutralizing agent from the reservoirs and is added through inlet .

In the RIPE zone the dispersion particle size is formed based upon the interfacial chemistry of the mixture components the mass transfer of the neutralizing agent and the distributive and dispersive mixing imparted by the screws including the stress strain and passage frequency.

The emulsified mixture may be further diluted with additional dispersion medium via one or more of inlet from reservoir in dilution zone of the extruder . Typically the dispersion is diluted to at least 30 weight percent dispersion medium in dilution zone . In dilution zone the packing fraction of the dispersion particles and the viscosity of the mixture are reduced. For example the viscosity may be reduced from a magnitude of about 10to about 10centipoise.

A cooling zone may be located toward the end of screw near the outlet of extruder . Cooling zone providing heat exchange between the dispersion mixture and a cooling medium not shown may be used to cool the dispersion mixture to a temperature below that of the boiling point of the dispersion medium. For example where the dispersion medium is water the dispersion mixture may be cooled to a temperature below about 100 C. The reduction in dispersion mixture temperature may allow further processing of the mixture without unwanted loss of dispersion medium through evaporation.

The cooled dispersion may then exit extruder via outlet . Outlet may be coupled to control valve as described above to maintain extruder discharge pressure control.

Regarding screws and the internals of extruder one or more rotating restriction orifices may be located along screw in some embodiments. In addition to control valve rotating restriction orifices may improve stability of the dispersion forming process. In other embodiments non rotating restriction orifices not shown may be used.

Screws may also include high mixing kneading disks in some embodiments. In addition to the high mixing kneading disks described above embodiments of the extrusion apparatus disclosed herein may also include low free volume kneading disks which may minimize the volume weighted particle size distribution of dispersions formed using extruder .

In other embodiments of the extrusion apparatus the reverse elements may be removed preventing unwanted back mixing. Additionally the melt seal may be located directly upstream of the HIPE zone in some embodiments.

As illustrated in HIPE zone may be variable in length. Depending upon the feed composition such as the polymer dispersing agent neutralizing agent etc. it may be desirable to have a longer or a shorter HIPE zone. Multiple dispersion medium injection points may be provided to allow the HIPE zone to be extended or shortened as needed. As the particle size of the dispersed polymer particles is formed in the HIPE zone adequate mixing should be provided to develop the desired particle size. Having a variable length for the HIPE zone may allow for a broader range of polymers to be processed in a single extruder providing for process flexibility among other benefits.

For example the twin screw extruder barrels screws and dilution medium injection points may such that the length to diameter L D of the HIPE zone is at least 20 when producing fatty acid dispersions and that the L D of the HIPE zone is at least 16 when producing EEA dispersions. Additionally the twin screw extruder barrels screws and dilution medium injection points may such that the 1st dilution zone L D is at least 4 when producing fatty acid dispersions and that the 1st dilution zone L D is at least 8 when producing EEA dispersions.

The apparatuses described above may be used to produce dispersions where in some embodiments the polymer feed rate may range from about 50 to about 2000 lb h about 22 to about 907 kg h . In other embodiments the polymer feed rate may range from about 100 to about 1000 lb h between about 45 and about 454 kg h .

In other embodiments the screw speed may range from about 300 rpm to about 1200 rpm. In yet other embodiments the extruder discharge pressure may be maintained at a pressure ranging from about 300 to about 800 psig from about 21 bar to about 56 bar .

The above described extrusion apparatus may be used to form polymer dispersions. The polymer dispersions may be formed from any thermoplastic polymer in some embodiments polyolefins in other embodiments and ethylene based polymers or propylene based polymers in other embodiments. In select embodiments the extrusion apparatus may be useful for forming aqueous dispersions of polyolefins including ethylene based and propylene based polymers copolymers interpolymers and multi block interpolymers.

Polyolefin dispersions in particular when applied to a substrate may provide for water and chemical resistance heat sealability adhesion to polyolefin substrates low temperature flexibility. Additionally the wide range of polyolefins may provide raw materials for producing dispersions and coatings having a wide range of hardness and heat resistance. Also most polyolefins are compliant with various regulations allowing for direct food contact.

The process for forming polyolefin dispersions described above may be integrated with various downstream processes such as foaming and spray drying to create foams films coatings powders and other value added products. Additionally the dispersions may provide some synergy with other polyolefin system components such as fibers and films.

In particular embodiments it may be desired to utilize the dispersion in the form of foam. When preparing foams it is often preferred to froth the dispersion. For example froths and foams may be prepared as described in WO2005 021622 which is fully incorporated herein by reference. Preferred in the practice of this invention is the use of a gas as a frothing agent. Examples of suitable frothing agents include gases and or mixtures of gases such as air carbon dioxide nitrogen argon helium and the like. Particularly preferable is the use of air as a frothing agent. Frothing agents are typically introduced by mechanical introduction of a gas into a liquid to form a froth. This technique is known as mechanical frothing. In preparing a frothed dispersion it is preferred to mix all components and then blend the air or gas into the mixture using equipment such as an OAKES MONDO or FIRESTONE frother.

Surfactants useful for preparing a stable froth are referred to herein as foam stabilizers. Foam stabilizers are useful in the practice of the present invention. Those having ordinary skill in this field will recognize that a number of foam stabilizers may be used. Foam stabilizers may include for example sulfates succinamates and sulfosuccinamates.

As an initial test seven dispersions using EAA as the stabilizing agent are formed. Specifically 70 30 polymer stabilizing agent blends are formed using thermoplastic ethylene acrylic acid copolymer with an acrylic acid content of 20.5 wt a density of about 0.958 g cm ASTM D 792 and a melt index of 13.5 g 10 min. as determined according to ASTM D1238 at 125 C. and 2.16 kg a Mw Mn of about 3.7 and a melting point of about 77 C. as determined by DSC at a scanning rate of about 10 C. per minute commercially available as PRIMACOR 59801 available from The Dow Chemical Company Midland Mich. as the stabilizing agent.

Dispersions similar to those of Examples 1 7 above are produced using an extruder apparatus similar to that illustrated in . The extruder apparatus includes a self cleaning micro notch V ball control valve rotating restriction orifices and the above described high mixing kneading disks. For comparative purposes extruder operations are compared to an unmodified extruder apparatus having a back pressure regulator at the exit of the extruder for pressure control similar to that illustrated in . The two extruder apparatuses have similar L D s for both the emulsification zone or HIPE zone and the first dilution zone.

Comparison of the extruder operations indicates that operation of the modified extruder apparatus is much improved compared to the unmodified extruder apparatus. Comparing and the variance in extruder discharge pressure DISCHARGE neutralizing agent addition pressure IA PSI and first dilution zone pressure 1STDILPSI are each decreased for the modified extruder apparatus indicative of improved process stability.

The improved process stability achieved through use of one or more of the V ball control valve the high mixing kneading disks and the rotating restriction orifices may result in a more consistent dispersion product. For example the feed rate of neutralizing agent may be more consistent as illustrated in due to the improved extruder pressure control obtained via one or more of the noted modifications.

Higher crystallinity polyolefin foams formed from the dispersion of higher crystallinity polyolefins may have a number of useful properties. Modified foams are also within the purview of this invention and may include micro cavity containing thermoplastic foams such as those disclosed in U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60 700 644. The micro cavity containing additives include such materials as super absorbent polymers SAP for articles such as infant and children diapers adult incontinence pants feminine hygiene pads household cleaning articles pet urine absorption mats pads and garbage bag liquid absorbent pads.

Advantageously the present invention provides for aqueous dispersions of higher crystallinity polyolefin. Coatings and articles produced from dispersions disclosed herein may advantageously have a higher heat resistance a greater resistance to compression set at elevated temperatures and may exhibit a broader operating window in various extrusion and molding process.

These dispersions may be used as coatings and as articles such as foams. Alternative uses for these dispersions include adhesives for bonding and sealing various substrates especially corrugated boxes and plastics films such as biaxially oriented polypropylene BOPP polyester and polyamide films. Additionally these foams may be used in the construction of diapers and feminine hygiene pads as the liquid absorbent and distribution layer. Today such diapers and feminine hygiene pads are packaged tightly. Foams formed from dispersions disclosed herein may provide significantly lower compression set at 40 C. allowing near full recovery of the original foam thickness a requirement for the end product.

In another aspect dispersions made using higher crystallinity polyolefins may be used as a coating or adhesive where heat resistance is required. Many automotive applications require heat resistance at temperatures of 60 C. and higher.

In addition to the mechanical emulsification of a higher crystallinity polyolefin dispersion blends of different higher crystallinity polyolefins and blends of higher crystallinity polyolefins and other polyolefins and plastics may be produced to enhance certain properties such as adhesion to specific substrates such as paper or glass and heat resistance improve the abrasion resistance of polyolefin films and allow the deposition of harder materials on a substrate.

In another embodiment of the present invention a dispersion of higher crystallinity polyolefins may be used in connection with other dispersions to form a blended dispersion product.

In addition to the applications described above higher crystallinity polyolefin dispersions described herein may be useful in a number of other applications.

Accordingly in one application dispersions of higher crystallinity polyolefins may be useful in cellulose based articles especially having a specific volume of less than 3 cc gm for example paper and board structures incorporating a compound comprising an aqueous polyolefin dispersion resulting in articles having improved properties. In various embodiments the articles may have improved oil and grease resistance improved water resistance controlled coefficients of friction thermal embossability thermal formability improved wet and dry strength or an improved softness among others. Such techniques and compositions are disclosed in U.S. Application Ser. No. 60 750 466 which is expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Thus in one application dispersions of higher crystallinity polyolefins may be useful in providing a cellulose based article having especially those having a specific volume of less than 3 cc gm including a cellulose based composition and an applied compound. The applied compound at the time of application may include a higher crystallinity polyolefin and at least one dispersing agent. The article may have an oil and grease resistance value of at least 9 as measured using the Kit test at an exposure time of 15 seconds.

Thus in one application dispersions of catalytic linear multi block olefins may be useful in providing a cellulose based article especially those having a specific volume of less than 3 cc gm including a cellulose based composition and an applied compound. The applied compound at the time of application may include a higher crystallinity polyolefin and at least one dispersing agent. The cellulose based article may have a water resistance value of less than about 10 g m 120 seconds as measured via the Cobb test.

The Kit test the kit value of samples may be determined using TAPPI T559cm 02. The test was performed flat as described in the TAPPI test. This involves putting five separate drops of oil onto the board s surface and inspecting the board after a specified amount of exposure time 15 seconds to see if any pronounced darkening of the paper appears. A modified Kit test run at elevated temperature s can be useful to distinguish deposited dispersions made using the catalytic linear multi block polymers especially for ethylene based block polymers versus other ethylene based random copolymers. Such elevated temperatures for testing can be as high as about 80 C. but preferably tested around 50 C. Film layers made using deposited dispersions from the catalytic linear ethylenic multi block polymers show higher Kit values at 50 C. than Kit values also at 50 C. for random ethylene polymer based deposited dispersions even at similar overall ethylene polymer density and melt index.

The Cobb test Cobb tests may be performed in accordance with ASTM D3285 93. The exposure time was 2 minutes. The test involves a known volume of water 100 ml being poured onto a specific area of the board s surface 100 cm . The board is weighed before and after the exposure and the difference between the two can then be expressed as the weight per unit area of water absorbed in that given time the lower the Cobb value the better the result. A modified Cobb test run at elevated temperature s can be useful to distinguish deposited dispersions made using higher crystallinity polyolefins. Such elevated temperatures for testing can be as high as about 80 C. but preferably tested around 50 C.

Thus embodiments disclosed herein may relate to cellulose based compositions which are generally referred to as paper and or paperboard products i.e. other than paper towels such as newsprint uncoated groundwood coated groundwood coated free sheet uncoated free sheet packaging and industrial papers linerboard corrugating medium recycled paperboard bleached paperboard writing paper typing paper photo quality paper wallpaper etc. Such compositions can generally be formed in accordance with the present invention from at least one paper web.

For example in one embodiment the paper product can contain a single layered paper web formed from a blend of fibers. In another embodiment the paper product can contain a multi layered paper i.e. stratified web. Furthermore the paper product can also be a single or multi ply product e.g. more than one paper web wherein one or more of the plies may contain a paper web formed according to the present invention. Normally the basis weight of a paper product of the present invention is between about 10 grams per square meter g m to about 525 g m. Normally the specific volume of a paper product in accordance with embodiments of the present invention is between about 0.3 glee to about 2 g cc.

Any of a variety of materials can be used to form the paper products of the present invention. For example the material used to make paper products can include fibers formed by a variety of pulping processes such as kraft pulp sulfite pulp thermomechanical pulp etc.

Papermaking fibers useful in the process of the present invention include any cellulosic fibers that are known to be useful for making cellulosic base sheets. Suitable fibers include virgin softwood and hardwood fibers along with non woody fibers as well as secondary i.e. recycled papermaking fibers and mixtures thereof in all proportions. Non cellulosic synthetic fibers can also be included in the aqueous suspension. Papermaking fibers may be derived from wood using any known pulping process including kraft and sulfite chemical pulps.

Fibers suitable for making paper webs comprise any natural or synthetic cellulosic fibers including but not limited to nonwoody fibers such as cotton abaca kenaf sabai grass flax esparto grass straw jute hemp bagasse milkweed floss fibers and pineapple leaf fibers and woody fibers such as those obtained from deciduous and coniferous trees including softwood fibers such as northern and southern softwood kraft fibers hardwood fibers such as eucalyptus maple birch and aspen. Woody fibers can be prepared in high yield or low yield forms and can be pulped in any known method including kraft sulfite high yield pulping methods and other known pulping methods. Fibers prepared from organosols pulping methods can also be used including the fibers and methods disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 793 898 issued Dec. 27 1988 to Laamanen et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 594 130 issued Jun. 10 1986 to Chang et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 3 585 104. Useful fibers can also be produced by anthraquinone pulping exemplified by U.S. Pat. No. 5 595 628 issued Jan. 21 1997 to Gordon et al.

In one embodiment a portion of the fibers such as up to 50 or less by dry weight or from about 5 to about 30 by dry weight can be synthetic fibers such as rayon polyolefin fibers polyester fibers bicomponent sheath core fibers multi component binder fibers and the like. An exemplary polyethylene fiber is PULPEX available from Hercules Inc. Wilmington DE . Any known bleaching method can be used. Synthetic cellulose fiber types include rayon in all its varieties and other fibers derived from viscose or chemically modified cellulose. Chemically treated natural cellulosic fibers can be used such as mercerized pulps chemically stiffened or crosslinked fibers or sulfonated fibers. For good mechanical properties in using papermaking fibers it can be desirable that the fibers be relatively undamaged and largely unrefined or only lightly refined. While recycled fibers can be used virgin fibers are generally useful for their mechanical properties and lack of contaminants. Mercerized fibers regenerated cellulosic fibers cellulose produced by microbes rayon and other cellulosic material or cellulosic derivatives can be used. Suitable papermaking fibers can also include recycled fibers virgin fibers or mixes thereof In certain embodiments capable of high bulk and good compressive properties the fibers can have a Canadian Standard Freeness of at least 200 more specifically at least 300 more specifically still at least 400 and most specifically at least 500. In some other embodiments portions of the fibers up to about 90 by dry weight may be synthetic fibers.

Other papermaking fibers that can be used in the present disclosure include paper broke or recycled fibers and high yield fibers. High yield pulp fibers are those papermaking fibers produced by pulping processes providing a yield of about 65 or greater more specifically about 75 or greater and still more specifically about 75 to about 95 . Yield is the resulting amount of processed fibers expressed as a percentage of the initial wood mass. Such pulping processes include bleached chemithermomechanical pulp BCTMP chemithermomechanical pulp CTMP pressure pressure thermomechanical pulp PTMP thermomechanical pulp TMP thermomechanical chemical pulp TMCP high yield sulfite pulps and high yield Kraft pulps all of which leave the resulting fibers with high levels of lignin. High yield fibers are well known for their stiffness in both dry and wet states relative to typical chemically pulped fibers.

In some embodiments the pulp fibers may include softwood fibers having an average fiber length of greater than 1 mm and particularly from about 2 mm to 5 mm based on a length weighted average. Such softwood fibers can include but are not limited to northern softwood southern softwood redwood red cedar hemlock pine e.g. southern pines spruce e.g. black spruce combinations thereof and the like. Exemplary commercially available pulp fibers suitable for the present invention include those available from Neenah Paper Inc. under the trade designations LONGLAC 19. 

In some embodiments hardwood fibers such as eucalyptus maple birch aspen and the like can also be used. In certain instances eucalyptus fibers may be particularly desired to increase the softness of the web. Eucalyptus fibers can also enhance the brightness increase the opacity and change the pore structure of the paper to increase the wicking ability of the paper web. Moreover if desired secondary fibers obtained from recycled materials may be used such as fiber pulp from sources such as for example newsprint reclaimed paperboard and office waste. Further other natural fibers can also be used in the present invention such as abaca sabai grass milkweed floss pineapple leaf and the like. In addition in some instances synthetic fibers can also be utilized. Some suitable synthetic fibers can include but are not limited to rayon fibers ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer fibers polyolefin fibers polyesters and the like.

As stated the paper product of the present invention can be formed from one or more paper webs. The paper webs can be single layered or multi layered. For instance in one embodiment the paper product contains a single layered paper web layer that is formed from a blend of fibers. For example in some instances eucalyptus and softwood fibers can be homogeneously blended to form the single layered paper web.

In another embodiment the paper product can contain a multi layered paper web that is formed from a stratified pulp furnish having various principal layers. For example in one embodiment the paper product contains three layers where one of the outer layers includes eucalyptus fibers while the other two layers include northern softwood kraft fibers. In another embodiment one outer layer and the inner layer can contain eucalyptus fibers while the remaining outer layer can contain northern softwood kraft fibers. If desired the three principle layers may also include blends of various types of fibers. For example in one embodiment one of the outer layers can contain a blend of eucalyptus fibers and northern softwood kraft fibers. However it should be understood that the multi layered paper web can include any number of layers and can be made from various types of fibers. For instance in one embodiment the multi layered paper web can be formed from a stratified pulp furnish having only two principal layers.

In accordance with the present invention various properties of a paper product such as described above can be optimized. For instance strength e.g. wet tensile dry tensile tear etc. softness lint level slough level and the like are some examples of properties of the paper product that may be optimized in accordance with the present invention. However it should be understood that each of the properties mentioned above need not be optimized in every instance. For example in certain applications it may be desired to form a paper product that has increased strength without regard to softness.

In this regard in one embodiment of the present invention at least a portion of the fibers of the paper product can be treated with hydrolytic enzymes to increase strength and reduce lint. In particular the hydrolytic enzymes can randomly react with the cellulose chains at or near the surface of the papermaking fibers to create single aldehyde groups on the fiber surface which are part of the fiber. These aldehyde groups become sites for cross linking with exposed hydroxyl groups of other fibers when the fibers are formed and dried into sheets thus increasing sheet strength. In addition by randomly cutting or hydrolyzing the fiber cellulose predominantly at or near the surface of the fiber degradation of the interior of the fiber cell wall is avoided or minimized. Consequently a paper product made from these fibers alone or made from blends of these fibers with untreated pulp fibers show an increase in strength properties such as dry tensile wet tensile tear etc.

Other examples of useful cellulose based compositions useful in the present invention include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 837 970 6 824 650 6 863 940 and in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. US20050192402 and 20040149412 each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Cellulosic webs prepared in accordance with the present invention can be used for a wide variety of applications such as paper and paperboard products i.e. other than paper towels newsprint uncoated groundwood coated groundwood coated free sheet uncoated free sheet packaging and industrial papers linerboard corrugating medium recycled paperboard and bleached paperboard. Webs made according to the present invention can be used in diapers sanitary napkins composite materials molded paper products paper cups paper plates and the like. Materials prepared according to the present invention can also be used in various textile applications particularly in textile webs comprising a blend of cellulosic materials and wool nylon silk or other polyamide or protein based fibers.

The paper products may contain a variety of fiber types both natural and synthetic. In one embodiment the paper products comprises hardwood and softwood fibers. The overall ratio of hardwood pulp fibers to softwood pulp fibers within the product including individual sheets making up the product may vary broadly. The ratio of hardwood pulp fibers to softwood pulp fibers may range from about 9 1 to about 1 9 more specifically from about 9 1 to about 1 4 and most specifically from about 9 1 to about 1 1. In one embodiment of the present invention the hardwood pulp fibers and softwood pulp fibers may be blended prior to forming the paper sheet thereby producing a homogenous distribution of hardwood pulp fibers and softwood pulp fibers in the z direction of the sheet. In another embodiment of the present invention the hardwood pulp fibers and softwood pulp fibers may be layered so as to give a heterogeneous distribution of hardwood pulp fibers and softwood pulp fibers in the z direction of the sheet. In another embodiment the hardwood pulp fibers may be located in at least one of the outer layers of the paper product and or sheets wherein at least one of the inner layers may comprise softwood pulp fibers. In still another embodiment the paper product contains secondary or recycled fibers optionally containing virgin or synthetic fibers.

In addition synthetic fibers may also be utilized in the present invention. The discussion herein regarding pulp fibers is understood to include synthetic fibers. Some suitable polymers that may be used to form the synthetic fibers include but are not limited to polyolefins such as polyethylene polypropylene polybutylene and the like polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate poly glycolic acid PGA poly lactic acid PLA poly malic acid PMLA poly caprolactone PCL poly p dioxanone PDS poly 3 hydroxybutyrate PHB and the like and polyamides such as nylon and the like. Synthetic or natural cellulosic polymers including but not limited to cellulosic esters cellulosic ethers cellulosic nitrates cellulosic acetates cellulosic acetate butyrates ethyl cellulose regenerated celluloses such as viscose rayon and the like cotton flax hemp and mixtures thereof may be used in the present invention. The synthetic fibers may be located in one or all of the layers and sheets comprising the paper product.

Cellulose based articles can be formed by a variety of processes known to those skilled in the art. Machines may be configured to have a forming section a press section a drying section and depending on the article formed optionally a reel. Examples of the details of the process steps and schematic illustrations may be found in Properties of Paper An Introduction 2nd edition W. Scott and J. Abbott TAPPI Press 1995. In a simplified description of the process typically a dilute suspension of pulp fibers is supplied by a head box and deposited via a sluice in a uniform dispersion onto a forming fabric of a conventional papermaking machine. The suspension of pulp fibers may be diluted to any consistency which is typically used in conventional papermaking processes. For example the suspension may contain from about 0.01 percent to about 1.5 percent by weight pulp fibers suspended in water. Water is removed from the suspension of pulp fibers to form a uniform layer of pulp fibers. Other paper making processes paper board manufacturing processes and the like may be utilized with the present invention. For example the processes disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 423 183 may be used.

The pulp fibers may be any high average fiber length pulp low average fiber length pulp or mixtures of the same. The high average fiber length pulps typically have an average fiber length from about 1.5 mm to about 6 mm. An exemplary high average fiber length wood pulp includes one available from the Neenah Paper Inc. under the trade designation LONGLAC 19.

The low average fiber length pulp may be for example certain virgin hardwood pulps and secondary i.e. recycled fiber pulp from sources such as for example newsprint reclaimed paperboard and office waste. The low average fiber length pulps typically have an average fiber length of less than about 1.2 mm for example from 0.7 mm to 1.2 mm.

Mixtures of high average fiber length and low average fiber length pulps may contain a significant proportion of low average fiber length pulps. For example mixtures may contain more than about 50 percent by weight low average fiber length pulp and less than about 50 percent by weight high average fiber length pulp. One exemplary mixture contains 75 percent by weight low average fiber length pulp and about 25 percent high average fiber length pulp.

The pulp fibers used in the present invention may be unrefined or may be beaten to various degrees of refinement. Small amounts of wet strength resins and or resin binders may be added to improve strength and abrasion resistance. Useful binders and wet strength resins include for example KYMENE 557 H available from the Hercules Chemical Company and PAREZ 631 available from American Cyanamid Inc. Cross linking agents and or hydrating agents may also be added to the pulp mixture. Debonding agents may be added to the pulp mixture to reduce the degree of hydrogen bonding if a very open or loose nonwoven pulp fiber web is desired. One exemplary debonding agent is available from the Quaker Chemical Company Conshohocken Pa. under the trade designation QUAKER 2008. The addition of certain debonding agents in the amount of for example 1 percent to 4 percent by weight of the composite also appears to reduce the measured static and dynamic coefficients of friction and improve the abrasion resistance of the continuous filament rich side of the composite fabric. The de bonder is believed to act as a lubricant or friction reducer.

When treating paper webs in accordance with the present disclosure the additive composition containing the higher crystallinity polyolefin dispersion can be applied to the web topically or can be incorporated into the web by being pre mixed with the fibers that are used to form the web. When applied topically the additive composition can be applied to the web when the web is wet or dry. In one embodiment the additive composition may be applied topically to the web during a creping process. For instance in one embodiment the additive composition may be sprayed onto the web or onto a heated dryer drum to adhere the web to the dryer drum. The web can then be creped from the dryer drum. When the additive composition is applied to the web and then adhered to the dryer drum the composition may be uniformly applied over the surface area of the web or may be applied according to a particular pattern.

When topically applied to a paper web the additive composition may be sprayed onto the web extruded onto the web or printed onto the web. When extruded onto the web any suitable extrusion device may be used such as a slot coat extruder or a meltblown dye extruder. When printed onto the web any suitable printing device may be used. For example an inkjet printer or a rotogravure printing device may be used.

The dispersion may be incorporated at any point in the paper manufacturing process. The point during the process at which the dispersion is incorporated into the cellulose based composition may depend upon the desired end properties of the cellulose based product as will be detailed later. Incorporation points may include pre treatment of pulp co application in the wet end of the process post treatment after drying but on the paper machine and topical post treatment. Incorporation of the dispersion of the present invention onto or in the cellulose based structure may be achieved by any of several methods as incorporated by reference and known by those of ordinary skill in the art.

In yet another application a higher crystallinity polyolefin dispersion formed in accordance with the disclosure is suitable for impregnating a fibrous structure. In certain cases a fibrous structure impregnated with such a stiffening composition can provide adequate stiffness elasticity resilience adhesion and shape retention for use in shoe stiffeners such as toe boxes counters and the like. Suitable techniques for impregnation are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 300 993 which is expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.

One skilled in the art will appreciate that a desirable degree or amount of impregnation can range from a partial saturation of the fibrous structure to a complete saturation of the fibrous structure. The desired degree of impregnation can depend upon variables including the nature of the fiber being impregnated and the nature of impregnate for example. One skilled in the art will also appreciate that the intended end properties of the impregnated structure will influence the selection of the specific ingredients fibers and dispersions for example and processing parameters.

In yet another application dispersions of higher crystallinity polyolefins may be useful as toner compositions wherein at least one selected from the group consisting of a colorant and a magnetic pigment is used with the dispersion and wherein the dispersion has an average volume diameter particle size from about 0.3 to about 8.0 microns. Techniques for formulating such toner compositions are discussed in co pending co assigned application U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60 779 126 filed on Mar. 3 2006 which is expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Briefly after forming the dispersion at least a portion of the liquid may be removed to form toner particles. In selected embodiments substantially all of the water may be removed to form base toner particles. In one embodiment drying of the dispersion may be accomplished by spray drying the dispersion. As is known in the art spray drying involves the atomization of a liquid feedstock into a spray of droplets and contacting the droplets with hot air in a drying chamber. The sprays are typically produced by either rotary wheel or nozzle atomizers. Evaporation of moisture from the droplets and formation of dry particles proceed under controlled temperature and airflow conditions. Powder is discharged substantially continuously from the drying chamber. Operating conditions and dryer design are selected according to the drying characteristics of the product and powder specification.

Thus in one embodiment a dispersion may be formed and shipped to another location where the dispersion is subjected to a post treatment process such as spray drying to form a toner powder.

In select embodiments it is advantageous to add auxiliary fine particles to the base toner particles in order to improve the fluidity the electrification stability or the blocking resistance at a high temperature etc. The auxiliary fine particles to be fixed on the surface of the base toner particles may be suitably selected for use among various inorganic or organic fine particles.

As the inorganic fine particles various carbides such as silicon carbide boron carbide titanium carbide zirconium carbide hafnium carbide vanadium carbide tantalum carbide niobium carbide tungsten carbide chromium carbide molybdenum carbide and calcium carbide various nitrides such as boron nitride titanium nitride and zirconium nitride various borides such as zirconium boride various oxides such as titanium oxide calcium oxide magnesium oxide zinc oxide copper oxide aluminum oxide cerium oxide silica and colloidal silica various titanate compounds such as calcium titanate magnesium titanate and strontium titanate phosphate compounds such as calcium phosphate sulfides such as molybdenum disulfide fluorides such as magnesium fluoride and carbon fluoride various metal soaps such as aluminum stearate calcium stearate zinc stearate and magnesium stearate talc bentonite various carbon black and conductive carbon black magnetite and ferrite may for example be employed. As the organic fine particles fine particles of a styrene resin an acrylic resin an epoxy resin or a melamine resin may for example be employed.

Among such auxiliary fine particles silica titanium oxide alumina zinc oxide various carbon black or conductive carbon black may for example be particularly preferably employed. Further such auxiliary fine particles may include the above mentioned inorganic or organic fine particles where the surface of the particles is treated by surface treatment such as hydrophobic treatment by a treating agent such as a silane coupling agent a titanate coupling agent a silicone oil a modified silicone oil a silicone varnish a fluorinated silane coupling agent a fluorinated silicone oil or a coupling agent having amino groups or quaternary ammonium bases. Such treating agents may be used in combination as a mixture of two or more of them.

As a method for adding the auxiliary fine particles to the base toner particles a method is known to add and blend them by means of a high speed stirring machine such as a Henschel mixer. However in order to improve the blocking resistance at a high temperature it is preferred to have the auxiliary fine particles fixed on the surface of the base toner particles. In the present invention fixing means an addition method employing an apparatus capable of exerting a compression sharing stress hereinafter referred to as a compression shearing treatment apparatus or an apparatus capable of melting or softening the surface of the base toner particles hereinafter referred to as a particle surface melting treatment apparatus . By such fixing treatment the auxiliary fine particles may be firmly be fixed to the surface of the base toner particles without substantial pulverization of the base toner particles whereby blocking resistance during the storage at a high temperature may be improved and it is possible to produce a toner which is less likely to bring about fusion to components of a copying machine or a printer even in a continuous copying operation.

The above mentioned compression shearing treatment apparatus is constructed to have a narrow clearance defined by a head surface and a head surface a head surface and a wall surface or a wall surface and a wall surface which are mutually mobile while a distance is maintained so that the particles to be treated are forcibly passed through the clearance whereby a compression stress and a shearing stress will be exerted to the surface of the particles without substantially pulverizing them. As the compression shearing treatment apparatus to be used a mechanofusion apparatus manufactured by Hosokawa Micron K.K. may for example be mentioned.

The above mentioned particle surface melting treatment apparatus is usually constructed so that a mixture of the base toner fine particles and the auxiliary fine particles is instantaneously heated to a temperature of at least the melting initiation temperature by means of for example a hot air stream thereby to have the auxiliary fine particles fixed. As the particle surface melting treatment apparatus to be used a surfacing system manufactured by Nippon Neumatic K.K. may be employed.

In yet another application dispersions using a higher crystallinity polyolefm may be useful as films adhesives or other sealing and or packaging applications. This particular application involves applying a dispersion formulated in accordance with the above disclosure to a substrate. Those having skill in the art will appreciate that any useful substrate may be used. In particular a wide variety of polymer substrates may be used and even more particularly oriented polymers may be used. Such techniques are disclosed for example in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20050271888 which is expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.

In yet another application dispersions using a higher crystallinity polyolefin may be useful in forming long fiber reinforced thermoplastic concentrates. Techniques for forming such concentrates are disclosed in co pending co assigned Ser. No. 60 697 324 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Accordingly the scope of the invention should be limited only by the attached claims.
