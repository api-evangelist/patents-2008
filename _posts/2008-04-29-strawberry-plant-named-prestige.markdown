title: Strawberry plant named ‘PRESTIGE’
abstract: This invention relates to a new and distinct variety of strawberry plant named ‘PRESTIGE’. This new strawberry plant named ‘PRESTIGE’ is primarily adapted to the growing conditions of the central coast of California, and is primarily characterized by its medium to large plant size; medium fruit size; spreading calyx segments; long petiolule length; three to four leaflets/tri-foliate; moderate fruit production with very good flavor; and medium green foliage with medium glossy texture and medium interveinal blistering.

The present invention relates to a new and distinct strawberry variety named PRESTIGE . This new variety is a result of a controlled cross made in 2000 in an ongoing breeding program between strawberry variety designated PS 1269 patented U.S. Plant Pat. No. 10 686 and strawberry variety designated PS 3523 patented U.S. Plant Pat. No. 14 447 . The variety is botanically known as

The seedling resulting from the aforementioned cross was selected from a controlled breeding plot in Monterey County California in the summer of 2002. After its selection the new variety was asexually propagated by stolons in both San Joaquin County California and Siskiyou County California. The new variety was extensively tested over the next several years in fruiting fields in Monterey County California. This propagation has demonstrated that the combination of traits disclosed herein as characterizing the new variety are fixed and remain true to type through successive generations of asexual reproduction.

 PRESTIGE is primarily adapted to the climate and growing conditions of the central coast of California. The nearby Pacific Ocean provides the needed humidity and moderate temperatures to produce a strong vigorous plant and maintain fruit quality during the spring summer and fall production months.

The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be unique characteristics of PRESTIGE which in combination distinguish this strawberry plant as a new and distinct variety 

The strawberry varieties that are believed to be most closely related to the new strawberry variety PRESTIGE are the strawberry variety PS 592 patented U.S. Plant Pat. No. 9 903 and the strawberry variety PS 4634 patented U.S. Plant Pat. No. PP 17 487 . In comparison to the similar strawberry varieties PS 592 and PS 4634 the new strawberry variety PRESTIGE differs by the following combination of characteristics as described in Table 1 

 PRESTIGE has not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The characteristics of the new variety may vary in detail depending upon variations in environmental factors including weather temperature humidity and light intensity day length soil type and location.

The aforementioned photographs together with the following description of the new variety PRESTIGE unless otherwise noted is based on observations taken during the 2007 growing season in Monterey County California. These measurements and ratings were taken from plants of PRESTIGE dug from a high elevation nursery located in Siskiyou County California during the middle of October 2006 and planted approximately 3 weeks later in Monterey County California. The approximate age of the observed plants is 8 to 10 months. Yield observations and fruit quality characteristics are averaged from four years of data collected from the 2004 through 2007 growing seasons. Flower measurements and characteristics are from secondary flowers unless otherwise noted. Fruit characteristics and measurements are from secondary fruit unless otherwise noted.

The following Tables 8 describe fruit plant stolon foliage fruiting truss flower and pest disease characteristics of the new strawberry PRESTIGE in comparison to the similar strawberry variety PS 592 patented U.S. Plant Pat. No. PP 9 903 and strawberry variety PS 4634 patented U.S. Plant Pat. No. PP 17 487 .
