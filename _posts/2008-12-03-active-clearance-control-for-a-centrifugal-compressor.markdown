The present invention relates generally to gas turbine engines having centrifugal compressors and more specifically to control of clearances between an impeller and a shroud of a centrifugal compressor.

Conventional gas turbine engines having centrifugal compressors typically have an axial cold clearance between the impeller and the impeller shroud set such that a rub between them will not occur at the operating conditions that will cause the highest clearance closure which is typically a cold burst. Active clearance control systems have been developed to control radial turbine clearances between tips of axial flow radially extending turbine and compressor blades and shrouds surrounding the blades. Typically these active clearance control systems are thermally activated and use relatively cold or hot air or a combination of both from the fan different compressor stages or compressor discharge air to thermally cool or heat turbine or compressor shrouds or shroud support structures or casings in order to reduce the operating radial clearances. Controlling radial turbine clearances between tips of axial flow radially extending turbine and compressor blades and shrouds surrounding the blades increases fuel efficiency and reduces wear on the blades due to rubs.

It is known in the art to minimize clearance between the blade tips of an impeller rotating within a gas turbine engine and a surrounding blade tip shroud to reduce leakage of a working fluid around the blade tips of centrifugal compressor stages. Several actuation systems for adjusting blade tip clearance during engine operation have been developed. These systems often include complicated linkages contribute significant weight and or require a significant amount of power to operate. Thus there continues to be a demand for advancements in blade clearance technology to decrease impeller tip clearance thus causing an increase in overall compressor efficiency.

A gas turbine engine centrifugal compressor and active control system assembly includes a centrifugal compressor having a plurality of centrifugal compressor blades mounted on an annular centrifugal compressor impeller an annular blade tip shroud adjacent to blade tips of the blades a substantially sealed annular cavity bounded in part by the annular blade tip shroud and an active control system for controlling an annular blade tip clearance between the annular blade tip shroud and the blade tips by controlling a cavity pressure in the cavity.

An exemplary embodiment of the assembly includes valving controlled by an electronic controller for pressurizing and depressurizing the cavity. The valving is operably connected to a source of compressor discharge pressure air for pressurizing the cavity and may include a control pressure valve for pressurizing the cavity and depressurizing the cavity. The control pressure valve may be connected to the source of compressor discharge pressure air and to a vent line. An electronic controller may be controllably connected to the control pressure valve. The electronic controller may be operable for pulsing a solenoid of the control pressure valve many times a second for rapidly cycling the valves between open and closed states using pulse width modulation.

The assembly may further include one or more pressure sensors positioned for measuring the cavity pressure one or more clearance sensors positioned for measuring the blade tip clearance and the pressure and clearance sensors in signal supply communication with the electronic controller.

The assembly may further include the shroud supported by radially spaced apart annular impeller shroud radially outer and inner supports connected to a casing the cavity bounded by the outer and inner supports and the annular blade tip shroud and the radially outer and inner supports attached to radially outer and inner ends of the shroud respectively. The radially outer and inner supports may be connected to the casing by a bolted joint.

The assembly may further include axial stop pads extending radially outwardly from the radially outer end of and distributed circumferentially about the shroud of the stop pads.

An alternative embodiment of the active control system assembly includes a control pressure valve for pressurizing the cavity and a blow off pressure valve for depressurizing the cavity. The control and blow off pressure valves may be inline and connected to a pressure line extending between the cavity and the source of compressor discharge pressure air. An electronic controller may be controllably connected to the control and blow off pressure valves. The electronic controller may be operable for pulsing solenoids of the control and blow off pressure valves many times a second for rapidly cycling the valves between open and closed states using pulse width modulation.

A method for controlling the annular blade tip clearance includes controlling the cavity pressure with the active control system. The method may further include valving a source of compressor discharge pressure air for increasing the cavity pressure in the cavity and using a control pressure valve for the increasing of the cavity pressure in the cavity and for decreasing the cavity pressure in the cavity. The electronic controller may be used for controlling the control pressure valve for the controlling of the cavity pressure by opening and closing the control pressure valve for pressurizing the cavity with the source of compressor discharge pressure air and alternatively closing the control pressure valve for depressurizing the cavity with a pressure sink.

The method may further include pulsing a solenoid in the control pressure valve for opening and closing the control pressure valve many times a second for rapidly cycling the valve between open and closed states for the controlling of the cavity pressure using pulse width modulation for the pulsing of the solenoid. The method may further include measuring the cavity pressure using one or more pressure sensors positioned for measuring the cavity pressure and in signal supply communication with the electronic controller measuring the blade tip clearance using one or more clearance sensors positioned for measuring the blade tip clearance and in signal supply communication with the electronic controller and using output from the pressure and clearance sensors to the electronic controller for further controlling the control pressure valve for the controlling of the cavity pressure.

Illustrated in gas turbine engine with a high pressure gas generator having a single stage centrifugal compressor as a final compressor stage and an active control system for controlling clearances or gaps in the centrifugal compressor . The high pressure gas generator has a high pressure rotor including in downstream flow relationship of a high pressure compressor a combustor and a high pressure turbine . The rotor is rotatably supported about an engine centerline by a forward bearing in a front frame and a rear bearing not shown disposed downstream of turbine in a turbine frame not shown .

In the exemplary embodiment illustrated herein the compressor is a five stage axial compressor followed by the single stage centrifugal compressor having an annular centrifugal compressor impeller . Outlet guide vanes are disposed between the five stage axial compressor and the single stage centrifugal compressor . Compressor discharge pressure CDP air exits the impeller and passes through a diffuser and then through a deswirl cascade into a combustion chamber within the combustor surrounded by a combustor casing where it is conventionally mixed with fuel provided by a plurality of fuel nozzles and ignited in an annular combustion zone bounded by the combustor . Resulting hot combustion gases flow through the turbine causing rotation of the high pressure rotor and continue downstream for further work extraction in a low pressure turbine not shown and final exhaust as is conventionally known. In the exemplary embodiment depicted herein the high pressure turbine includes in downstream serial flow relationship first and second high pressure turbine stages having first and second stage disks . A forward shaft connects the high pressure turbine in rotational driving engagement to the impeller . First and second stage nozzles are directly upstream of the first and second high pressure turbine stages respectively. Disposed radially inwardly from inner wall of combustor casing is annular cavity which extends radially from wall to the forward shaft .

Referring to the compressor discharge pressure CDP air is discharged from the impeller of the centrifugal compressor and used to combust fuel in the combustor and to cool components of turbine subjected to the hot combustion gases namely the first stage nozzle a first stage shroud and the first stage disk . The compressor includes a forward casing and an aft casing . The forward casing generally surrounds the axial compressor and the aft casing generally surrounds the centrifugal compressor and supports the diffuser directly downstream of the centrifugal compressor . The compressor discharge pressure CDP air is discharged from the impeller of the centrifugal compressor directly into the diffuser .

Referring to the impeller includes a plurality of centrifugal compressor blades radially extending from rotor disc portion . Opposite and axially forward of the blades is an annular blade tip shroud . The shroud is adjacent to blade tips of the blades defining an annular blade tip clearance therebetween. The blade tip clearance varies in axial width W in a radial direction R as measured from the engine centerline . It is desirable to minimize the blade tip clearance during the engine operating cycle and avoid or minimize rubs between the shroud and the blade tips of the blades particularly during engine accelerations such as during cold bursts.

To this end the active control system was developed. The shroud is supported by radially spaced apart annular impeller shroud radially outer and inner supports which are both connected by a bolted joint to the aft casing . The radially outer and inner supports are attached such as by brazing to radially outer and inner ends of the shroud respectively. A substantially sealed annular cavity is thus formed between the shroud and the radially outer and inner supports . The radially outer support is substantially thinner and more flexible than the radially inner support and acts as a flexible element that allows the shroud to flex or rotate about the bolted joint and also seals the cavity . An annular stiffener extending between and connected to the radially outer support and the shroud stiffens the assembly with respect to modal response and therefore prevents resonance of the shroud during engine operation. Axial stop pads extend radially outwardly from the radially outer end of and are distributed circumferentially about the shroud . The axial stop pads are designed to prevent accidental rubs between the shroud and the impeller .

The exemplary embodiment of the active control system illustrated in controls a cavity pressure CP in the cavity using valving controlled by an electronic controller to pressurize the cavity with compressor discharge pressure CDP of the CDP air discharged from the impeller and venting the cavity to ambient pressure. The valving utilizes a control pressure valve connected by a pressure line to the combustor as a source of high pressure and a vent line to ambient as a source of low pressure or a low pressure sink. The control pressure valve is illustrated as being inline with an optional blow off valve between the cavity and the combustor . A cavity line connects the cavity and the control pressure valve through the blow off valve and an intermediate line and is used to supply pressure to or vent the cavity . Alternatively a bypass line illustrated in dashed line may be used to bypass the blow off valve to connect cavity line and the control pressure valve . In either embodiment the optional blow off valve remains in a closed position during normal engine operation if it is incorporated in the active control system .

The control pressure valve is used to increase and decrease the cavity pressure CP in the cavity with pressure of the CDP air . The blow off pressure valve is optional and is used blow off the cavity in the event of an active control system failure and is controlled independently. The control and blow off pressure valves illustrated herein are three way solenoid valves having three ports opened and closed by solenoid powered poppets. The ports are connected to the cavity by the cavity line to the pressure of the CDP air in the combustor by the pressure line and to the ambient pressure by the vent line .

Operation of the control and blow off pressure valves are controlled by the electronic controller which can be part of an electronic engine controller such as a full authority digital engine control FADEC . The electronic controller connected to the control and blow off pressure valves and operable for signalling valves to open and close. The electronic controller may use input from one or more pressure sensors positioned for measuring the cavity pressure CP and one or more clearance sensors positioned for measuring the blade tip clearance between the shroud and the blade tips of the blades . The control and blow off pressure valves may be electrically powered by solenoids in the valves as illustrated herein.

The electronic controller pulses the solenoid of the control pressure valve many times a second so as to rapidly cycle between open and closed positions or states. When the control pressure valve is in the open position the cavity is connected to the compressor discharge pressure CDP in the combustor . When the control pressure valve is in the closed position the cavity is connected through the vent line to ambient pressure or some other low pressure source or sink.

Referring to pulse width modulation PWM is used by electronic controller to control pulsing of the solenoid of the control pressure valve many times a second so as to rapidly cycle between open and closed states. Frequency of voltage pulses applied to the solenoids is kept constant during a duty cycle but may be varied during different duty cycles depending on engine operating conditions such as take off landing and cruise. The amount of pressure by which the cavity is pressurized or depressurized is a non linear function of the duty cycle i.e. the ratio of time that current is applied to the solenoid to the period and the pressure differential across the valve. Although pulse width modulation wherein the pulse frequency is held constant and only the pulse width is varied is the exemplary method of operation illustrated herein pulse ratio modulation wherein both pulse width and frequency are variables may also be employed. Thus to pressurize the cavity the pulse width in the open state is greater than the pulse width in the closed sate as illustrated by the 50 net supply and 50 net vent pulses respectively in .

Referring back to raising the cavity pressure CP in the cavity with pressure of the CDP air causes the shroud to move closer to the blade tips of the blades thus decreasing the annular blade tip clearance between the shroud and the blade tips . This happens because a surface averaged pressure on a forward facing surface of the shroud produces greater than a surface averaged pressure over on an aft facing surface of the shroud exposed to a radially increasing impeller pressure of the impeller during engine operation.

Thus the active control system using CDP air pressure will decrease the annular blade tip clearance between the shroud and the blade tips from its non pressure augmented amount. The non pressure augmented amount is the amount of the blade tip clearance when no pressure is either being supplied to or bled from the cavity by the active control system . Alternatively a secondary supply of pressure substantially lower than the impeller pressure can be used to increase the annular blade tip clearance between the shroud and the blade tips from its non pressure augmented amount.

If a problem develops then the control pressure valve is closed and the blow off pressure valve is opened and the cavity is depressurized. The pressure within the cavity pressure CP is lowered by blowing off or bleeding air out of the cavity to a pressure sink or a low pressure source which may be located outside the compressor typically ambient pressure and depressurizing stops when the blow off pressure valve is closed.

An alternative exemplary embodiment of the active control system is illustrated in . The cavity pressure CP in the cavity using the valving is controlled by the electronic controller to pressurize the cavity with the CDP air discharged from the impeller . The valving utilizes a two way supply pressure valve operating in parallel with a two way blow off pressure valve which supplies CDP pressure from a pressure line to the cavity from the combustor . The supply pressure valve is used to increase the cavity pressure CP in the cavity with pressure of the CDP air and the blow off pressure valve is used to decrease the cavity pressure CP in the cavity .

Operation of the supply and blow off pressure valves are controlled by the electronic controller which can be part of an electronic engine controller such as a full authority digital engine control FADEC . The electronic controller connected to the supply and blow off pressure valves and operable for signalling valves to open and close. The electronic controller may use input from one or more pressure sensors positioned for measuring the cavity pressure CP and one or more clearance sensors positioned for measuring the blade tip clearance between the shroud and the blade tips of the blades . The supply and blow off pressure valves may be electrically powered by solenoids in the valves as illustrated herein. The electronic controller pulses the solenoids of the supply and blow off pressure valves many times a second so as to rapidly cycle between open and closed states. When the supply pressure valve is open the cavity is pressurized and the pressure within the cavity pressure CP is increased using CDP air pressure and pressurizing stops when the supply pressure valve is closed. When blow off pressure valve is open the cavity is depressurized and the pressure within the cavity pressure CP is lowered by blowing off or bleeding air out of the cavity to a pressure sink or a low pressure source which may be located outside the compressor typically ambient pressure and depressurizing stops when the blow off pressure valve is closed.

Referring to pulse width modulation PWM is used by electronic controller to control pulsing the solenoids of the control and blow off pressure valves many times a second so as to rapidly cycle between open and closed states. Frequency of voltage pulses applied to the solenoids is kept constant during a duty cycle but may be varied during different duty cycles depending on engine operating conditions such as take off landing and cruise. The amount of pressure by which the cavity is pressurized or depressurized is a non linear function of the duty cycle i.e. the ratio of time that current is applied to the solenoid to the period and the pressure differential across the valve. Although pulse width modulation wherein the pulse frequency is held constant and only the pulse width is varied is the exemplary method of operation illustrated herein pulse ratio modulation wherein both pulse width and frequency are variables may also be employed.
