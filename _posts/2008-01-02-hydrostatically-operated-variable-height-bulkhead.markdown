It is important to protect waterfront properties from damage due to storm surges. Conventionally permanent bulkheads are used for this purpose. For many waterfront property owners the view of the waterway or waves breaking on the beach is highly desirable and high bulkheads restrict this view. Owner preferred low bulkheads require pumps to address wave induced overtopping from storm surges. Thus an alternative inexpensive bulkhead that adjusts vertically using only the mechanism of rising water level is desirable. In particular the adjusting bulkhead should not require operator attention pumping or active control mechanisms for its continued operation.

Refer also to and . In select embodiments of the present invention the float units are formed to include two guide slots permitting the braces to pass through opposing longitudinal sides of the float units . These guide slots allow vertical movement of the float units with changes in water level. In their lowest position select embodiments of the float units rest on the braces . In select embodiments of the present invention the space between the primary and secondary vertical sections is open to water flow either through holes in the secondary vertical section or between the bottom of the secondary section and the bottom of the adjacent water body or both as shown by the arrow . In select embodiments of the present invention the float units are prevented from rising beyond a pre specified design height. In select embodiments of the present invention guides may be included on the vertical sections to improve stability of the float units during a storm surge especially if braces are not needed between the vertical sections .

Refer also to . In select embodiments of the present invention a top plate or cap is attached to the float units . Since the top of a float unit is level with the top of the primary and secondary vertical sections of select embodiments of the present invention a top plate on the float unit may extend over the tops of both the primary and secondary vertical sections to reduce or eliminate fouling by debris and to provide an aesthetically pleasing top surface. In select embodiments of the present invention the top plate may be contiguous with the primary and secondary vertical sections or can overlap the primary and secondary vertical sections by some margin. The top plate may also serve as a stop preventing the float unit from sinking lower into the configuration acting in conjunction with stops provided at the bottom resting point of the float units or alternatively providing the sole stop for the floating unit i.e. serving in place of a stop . A top plate may also be slanted to allow for run off of rain and dirt the slant conforming to the top surface of a float unit .

Select embodiments of the present invention operate as follows. At normal water levels the float units rest on horizontal braces with the top plate resting on the top of the primary and secondary vertical sections. This resting position provides a bulkhead configuration that is low during calm seas resulting in good views and easy waterside access. As the seas get turbulent the water level rises and water enters the chamber between the primary and secondary vertical sections. This causes the float units to float i.e. rise hydrostatically in turn raising the effective height of the configuration . The increased height reduces or eliminates flooding due to wave overtopping. The water filled chamber between the primary and secondary vertical sections acts as a stilling basin thus the float units rise smoothly without excessive displacement due to impacting waves. In select embodiments of the present invention as the float units rise to a pre specified maximum height stop bars or rods engage the horizontal braces preventing excessive vertical extension of the float unit . The float units are held in a raised position for the duration of the rise in water level by the buoyant force of the submerged portion of the float unit . When the stilling basin level drops the float units lower hydrostatically with the still water level returning to their resting position. The float units may be sized to the needs of an individual site and the configuration tailored to control the amount of buoyant force available to lift the float units .

Select embodiments of the present invention as described above may not be water tight e.g. some water may pass through any gaps between neighboring float units . Water and debris barriers may be added to select embodiments of the present invention to provide added protection against elevated still water levels. In select embodiments of the present invention water barriers that seal off the gaps between float units may be attached to the top plate . The water barriers are positioned by the float units as they move vertically. In select embodiments of the present invention water barriers may be attached to the side of each float unit overlapping the gap between a float unit and its neighbor float unit to provide some protection against water and debris intrusion. In select embodiments of the present invention water barriers seals may comprise a flexible material such as neoprene rigid material such as aluminum plate or both. In select embodiments of the present invention water barriers may be enclosed within protective plates not shown separately that are anchored on the dry side of the barrier in order to protect the float units from impact fouling vandalism and the like.

Refer to . An embodiment of the present invention is shown in a schematic form with a dry side wall and a braced wet side wall restraining a vertically mobile float unit in a chamber within the walls . The wet side wall may extend some distance into the floor of the body of water as shown in or it may simply rely on a series of appropriately positioned braces to the dry side wall . The float unit has a bottom plate establishing a flange about the outer perimeter of the float unit . The flange of the bottom plate rests on lower stops thus supporting the float unit in its resting state i.e. when sea conditions are normal as at .

Refer to . As one alternative to the above described example instead of multiple braces and the flange on a bottom plate the float units incorporate two stop rods that pass through holes through the width and near the bottom of each float unit and a single location that may provide a pair of robust horizontal braces for each float unit as shown at . These stop rods limit the vertical travel of the float units when they contact the horizontal braces . The bottom of the float unit may rest on the lower stops or rely solely on a properly fastened top plate to preclude the float unit from dropping to the water level in the chamber .

In select embodiments of the present invention the wet side wall is braced to the dry side wall via a series of braces placed in pre specified locations along the walls in accordance with good engineering practice. Slots in the float units enable the float units to move vertically while also permitting further use of the braces as guides along which the float units move.

In select embodiments of the present invention a top plate cap is provided for each of the float units . This top plate prevents material from entering the chamber deters vandalism if secure fastenings are used and provides an aesthetic finished appearance when viewed from above.

In select embodiments of the present invention the float units are slidably joined via a slot and tab arrangement such that individual float units will move in one plane only with respect to the position of other such float units within the structure variable height bulkhead and not jam one another by skewing in the chamber .

In select embodiments of the present invention fluid e.g. water from a body of water for producing the necessary hydrostatic force may be introduced at the bottom of the wet side vertical section if the wet side vertical section is not buried in the bed of the body of water as seen at arrow in . Alternatively or in combination with the above means entry ways holes are provided in the wet side vertical section to permit fluid typically water to rise hydrostatically within the chamber to the level of the water outside the chamber . As depicted in the area above the shaded area in the chamber shown as A is empty since the water level is normal. However as shown in during storm surges the entire chamber may fill with water shaded area thereby applying the hydrostatic force necessary to raise the float units to their full height h above the dry side vertical section .

The removable upper stops also provide access for installation and maintenance of float units . As shown in access to the primary vertical section for installation of the upper stops may be provided via a trench or well along the structure should the ground level be near the top of the primary vertical section . In select embodiments of the present invention stop rods may be installed to contact a horizontal brace as an alternative to the removable upper stops of . As can be seen in a person at the level of the structure may have a clear view of the body of water a view not otherwise constrained except in a storm surge as depicted in with the float unit deployed because of the higher water level .

Refer to depicting the float unit in a deployed state because of the rise in water level from that at to that at resulting in the subsequent rise in the water level in the chamber . Also note the additional braces below the water level as an alternative embodiment to burying the secondary vertical section in the bottom . Again note that the view from structure is blocked by the float units of the variable height bulkhead only during a storm surge. Also shown in for select embodiments of the present invention is a cover for the trench . The cover may serve two purposes security against vandalism and prevention of debris buildup in the trench . Refer also to . Further in select embodiments of the present invention a locking mechanism operates to prevent vandals from lifting individual float units from the structure . The locking mechanism provides a bar that in normal sea conditions is locked horizontally through a ring in the float unit . However upon rising sea state a float moves vertically in a slot and releases the bar from its normal locked position allowing it to swing in a curve and release the locking mechanism from the ring . In select embodiments of the present invention a keyway is provided for maintenance personnel to release the locking mechanism by a tool not shown separately provided for that purpose.

Refer to . is a perspective view of a select embodiment of the present invention using sheet pile for both the primary vertical section and the secondary vertical section . The position of the slot and tab arrangement approximately centered on the edge of each float unit is apparent as is the position of the removable top stops and the entry ways for supplying the fluid typically water to the chamber to impose the necessary hydrostatic force to raise the float units . To enhance clarity the top plate is not shown except via dashed lines over one float unit . The top plate is affixed to move with the float unit . provides a top view of the embodiment of showing the relative position of the braces the top plate the vertical sections and the float units as slidably connected via the slot and tab arrangement .

Refer to illustrating a single float unit as may be employed in select embodiments of the present invention. A typical T shaped slot and corresponding tab are shown for slidably connecting multiple float units . Refer to for other like arrangements using simple rectangular slots A and corresponding tabs A that allow float units to slide while remaining connected as envisioned by embodiments of the present invention as shown in in which the single robust horizontal brace of is used. In two braces are shown in each of slots for illustrative purposes whereas a single robust brace is shown per slot in . Although braces are shown in rectangular cross section stabilizing the float unit via two slots other arrangements including cylindrical tubular and the like cross sections are envisioned by embodiments of the present invention as well as single slots or more than two slots . The flange integral to the bottom plate is also evident in whereas embodiments represented by using stop bars require no flange. In select embodiments of the present invention the top plate may be fastened via appropriate secure means such as via through bolts as shown at having special heads and the like.

In select embodiments of the present invention sheet pile may be used for both the primary vertical sections and the secondary vertical sections or just for the secondary vertical sections . Other suitable conventional construction materials may be used for either of the vertical sections including treated wood concrete composites and the like.

Refer to depicting a top plate that may be used in select embodiments of the present invention. To further prevent intrusion of debris sand dust and water top plates may be fitted with seals that overlap each float unit . The seals may comprise materials conventionally used for this purpose including any of commercially available composites silicones rubber specialty composites and combinations thereof in particular those materials having both UV resistance and abrasion resistance.

Refer to depicting an alternative geometry to the structure . To provide a self cleaning capacity the secondary vertical section is shorter than the primary vertical section enabling both the slant top float unit and its corresponding top plate to be slanted toward the wet side to provide for washing off the top of the structure during a rain or wind storm. This configuration would also facilitate performance of those embodiments incorporating the seals i.e. preclude pooling of water thereon.

Refer to further illustrating the mechanism of as may be employed to deter vandalism of the float units. The float rides in a slot in the secondary vertical section via the tab . As the fluid in the stilling basin rises the float contacts the lever that compresses a spring inside the mechanism that pulls the locking lever from the ring on the float unit . Upon a reduction in water level as shown at the float releases tension on the spring only after the float unit is positioned such that the ring is located in a proper position for the locking lever to again engage the ring . Other mechanisms for securing the float unit from ready removal by vandals may be envisioned by those skilled in the art and the mechanism of is but one way of carrying out an embodiment of the present invention that is employed to deter vandalism.

Compare the configuration of to that of . There is but one robust horizontal brace as compared to multiple horizontal braces in that of . Further in place of the complex vandal proof mechanism through of the configuration uses a pair of rods inserted near the bottom of the float units and parallel to the vertical sections to act as stop bars to both prevent the float units from floating out of their chambers but also to prevent vandals from taking individual float units . Should the top plate of the configuration be sufficient to hold the float unit above the water level at rest then even the bottom rests would not be necessary in the simple configuration . Also note that the configuration does not require a well or top therefor further reducing costs while also increasing the strength of the configuration at the top where it is needed in the event of a serious storm surge.
