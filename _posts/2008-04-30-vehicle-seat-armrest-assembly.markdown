In carrying our the above object the vehicle seat armrest assembly of the invention includes an armrest and a ratchet mechanism for mounting the armrest on a vehicle seat frame. The ratchet mechanism includes a vertical track for mounting on the seat frame and a linear ratchet plate mounted for vertical movement on the vertical track. The liner ratchet plate has vertically spaced teeth and a connection to the armrest to support the armrest. A pawl locking assembly is mounted by the vertical track and has a locking condition for cooperating with the teeth of the linear ratchet plate to permit vertical adjustment of the armrest from a lowermost position upwardly to successively higher positions until reaching an uppermost position whereupon the pawl locking mechanism is moved to a released condition to permit downward movement of the armrest to its lowermost position. The pawl locking assembly upon movement of the armrest to its lowermost position is moved from its released condition to its locking condition to again permit the upward armrest adjustment.

The vertical track includes a vertical track member and a pressure plate that is mounted by the vertical track member and cooperates therewith to mount the linear ratchet plate for vertical movement. More specifically the vertical track member includes spaced flanges that slidably contact one side of the linear ratchet plate and the pressure plate includes spaced slide portions that slidably contact the other side of the linear ratchet plate. Also a cover is mounted on and extends between the spaced flanges of the vertical track member.

The pawl locking assembly includes a pawl pivotally mounted on the track for movement between locking and released positions with respect to the linear ratchet plate teeth and a spring bias biases the pawl toward a locking position for contacting the teeth of the linear ratchet plate to support the armrest at a selected vertical location against downward movement while allowing upward movement to a higher location. The pawl locking assembly also includes a catch. A lower camming surface on the linear ratchet plate cams the pawl against the spring bias from its locking position to a released position out of contact with the linear ratchet plate teeth where the pawl is held by the catch when the armrest is moved to the uppermost position such that the armrest can then be moved to the lowermost position. An upper camming surface on the linear ratchet plate cams the pawl for release from the catch and movement to its locking position when the armrest is moved to its lowermost position in order to again permit upward adjusting movement of the armrest.

As disclosed the pawl locking assembly includes a spring having one leg that embodies the spring bias and another leg that embodies the catch. Furthermore the linear ratchet plate includes an upper opening within which its vertically spaced teeth are mounted and the liner ratchet plate includes a lower opening that receives a connecting member of the armrest connection. Also the vertical track member the pressure plate and the cover of the vertical track include vertically openings that receive the connection member of the armrest connection while permitting vertical movement thereof as the armrest is moved vertically.

The vehicle seat armrest assembly as disclosed has the armrest constructed to include a housing mounted by the connection to the ratchet mechanism. A track assembly is mounted by the housing and an upper armrest portion is mounted on the housing by the track assembly for adjustable movement along the armrest housing. The track assembly as disclosed includes a detent spring for adjustably positioning the upper armrest portion in a selected position on the housing.

The vehicle seat armrest assembly as disclosed has the connection of the ratchet mechanism to the armrest including a pivotal connection member that pivotally mounts the armrest housing. An adjuster adjusts the pivotal position of the armrest on the ratchet mechanism and the adjuster includes a threaded adjusting member have an knob that is rotated to adjust the pivotal position of the armrest on the ratchet mechanism. The spring mounted on the housing holds the threaded adjustment member against movement after adjustment.

The objects features and advantages of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.

With reference to a vehicle seat armrest assembly constructed in accordance with the present invention is generally indicated by and includes an armrest and a ratchet mechanism that mounts the armrest on a vehicle seat frame for vertical adjusting movement from the lowermost position shown in to successively higher positions until reaching an uppermost position partially shown by phantom representation. When the armrest is in the uppermost position the ratchet mechanism as is hereinafter more fully described releases the armrest for downward movement back to it lowermost position whereupon the ratchet mechanism then again is moved to locked condition to permit the upward adjusting movement to successively higher positions.

The ratchet mechanism as shown in includes a vertical track collectively indicated by for mounting on the seat frame and also includes a linear ratchet plate mounted for vertical movement on the vertical track. This linear ratchet plate as shown in and includes a plurality of vertically spaced teeth and also has a connection to the armrest as is hereinafter more fully described to support the armrest for its vertical movement and for pivotal positioning. The linear ratchet plate has a plurality of vertically spaced teeth and also has its connection embodied by a pivotal connection member for supporting the armrest on the linear ratchet plate as is hereinafter more fully described.

With further reference to and a pawl locking assembly is mounted on the vertical track and has a locking condition shown in and for cooperating with the teeth of the linear ratchet plate to permit vertical adjustment of the armrest from the lowermost position shown in to successively higher positions until reaching the uppermost position as illustrated in whereupon the pawl locking mechanism is moved to a released condition as shown in to permit downward movement of the armrest back to its lowermost position. The pawl locking assembly upon movement of the armrest to its lowermost position is moved from its released condition shown in to its locking condition shown in and to again permit the upward armrest adjustment.

As best shown in the vertical track includes a vertical track member and a pressure plate mounted by the vertical track member and cooperating therewith to mount the linear ratchet plate for vertical movement that through the connection moves the armrest vertically. The vertical track member has attachment openings through which unshown fasteners can be inserted to mount the track assembly on the associated vehicle seat frame. The vertical track member as shown in has a generally flattened U shaped configuration and includes spaced flanges that extend toward each other and slidably contact one side of the linear ratchet plate at its opposite edges . Furthermore the pressure plate has spaced slide portions that slidably contact the other side of the linear ratchet plate to provide a rattle free mounting for the vertical movement as previously described. In addition a cover is mounted on the flanges of the vertical track member . Lower and upper rivets shown in are received within openings in the pressure plate and openings in the cover and function to limit vertical movement of the linear ratchet plate without overloading the pawl locking assembly .

As shown in and the pawl locking assembly includes a pawl pivotally mounted by a headed pin that is received in an opening in the pressure plate . Pawl as shown in has a locking portion and is pivotally moved between the locking position of and and the released position of for controlling the armrest vertical movement. This locking portion has release and locking surfaces and for controlling the locking or released positioning of the pawl . In addition the pawl has a catch portion utilized to hold the pawl in the released position of as described below.

A formed leaf spring best shown in is supported as illustrated by mounting projection on the pressure plate and has one leg that provides a spring bias for biasing the pawl toward its locking position shown in and . Spring has another leg forming a curved catch that engages the pawl catch portion to hold the pawl in the release position shown in .

The linear ratchet plate shown in and includes an opening that received the pawl locking assembly and defines the vertically spaced teeth utilized in the armrest positioning. The linear ratchet plate opening also includes lower and upper camming surfaces and . When the armrest is moved to its uppermost position as shown in the lower camming surface contacts the release surface of the pawl locking portion and pivots the pawl from its locking position to its released position shown in where the catch engages the catch portion of the pawl and holds the pawl in this released position so that the pawl locking assembly is in its released condition. The armrest can then be moved downwardly from the uppermost position shown in to the lowermost position shown in where the upper camming surface of the linear ratchet plate contacts the release surface of the pawl locking portion to pivot the pawl to its locking position out of engagement with the spring catch and the spring bias then biases the pawl for its ratcheting movement with the vertically spaced teeth to permit upward adjustment of the armrest to successively higher positions until again reaching its uppermost position.

As shown in the linear ratchet plate also has a lower opening that receives the pivotal pin of connection for the vertical movement of the armrest with the linear ratchet plate. This pivotal connection member also extends through vertical openings and in the vertical track member pressure plate and cover respectively so as to permit the vertical armrest adjustment. In addition the pivotal connection member of connection is restrained from pivoting in any suitable manner such as by welding to the linear ratchet plate or by suitable formations in any of the openings and flats on the connection member to prevent its rotation with respect to the ratchet mechanism while permitting the vertical movement.

With reference to the armrest includes a housing that is mounted by the pivotal connection member of connection for the vertical adjusting movement as previously described. An upper armrest portion of armrest is supported by a track assembly collectively indicated by in for adjustable movement along the armrest housing. More specifically the track assembly includes a housing track member and an upper armrest portion track member that provide the support for adjustable movement. A detent spring mounted by the track member is received within detent openings of the track member to provide positioning at a plurality of locations.

With reference to the armrest housing has spaced support portions that receive the pivotal connection member of connection and mounts the armrest for pivotal movement. An adjuster generally indicated by adjusts the pivotal position of the armrest on the ratchet mechanism that controls the vertical positioning as previously described. As illustrated in this adjustment from a horizontal reference line is downward about 25 to a reference line or upward about 40 to a reference line . Of course different adjustment can also be utilized as appropriate for the particular armrest and its usage. In addition the armrest can also be pivoted to a nonuse or storage position that is generally vertical but slightly rearwardly inclined as shown by reference line .

As previously mentioned the pivotal connection member of connection is restrained against rotational movement by the ratchet mechanism while supporting the armrest for the pivotal movement described above. A vertical pin extends through the pivotal connection member and cooperates with the adjuster to control the armrest pivoting.

Adjuster includes a threaded adjusting member and is rotatably supported along the elongated direction of the armrest by a support web and a nut fixed in a suitable manner on the armrest housing. A knob at the opposite end of the armrest housing from the pivotal connection member permits manual rotation of the threaded adjustment member whose end contacts the vertical pin . As such rotation of the knob in one direction or the other pivots the armrest upwardly or downwardly between the positions of reference lines and shown in . Also a leaf spring mounted on the armrest is biased against the threaded adjustment member against movement after adjustment. Furthermore a stop pin contacts the vertical pin when the armrest is pivoted to the nonuse position to limit the rearwardly inclined movement.

While embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described it is not intended that these embodiments illustrate and describe all possible forms of the invention. Rather the words used in the specification are words of description rather than limitation and it is understood that various changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
