This application is a US National Phase Patent Application of PCT Application No. PCT US2008 052744 filed 1 Feb. 2008 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 899 565 filed Feb. 5 2007. Both of which are herein incorporated in their entirety by reference.

The present invention was made under Contract Nos. NBCH 0300099 and NBCH 3060004 awarded by the US Army and the United States Government has certain rights in this invention.

In the prior art a large area cone shaped structure has been used to support the pixel above the readout integrated circuit and to also provide electrical interconnect between the pixel and the integrated circuit.

The performance of microbolometer pixels may be degraded by parts of the pixel structure that are necessary but do not contribute to the image signal. One example of this is the pixel contact structure that both physically supports the pixel and provides electrical interconnect from the suspended pixel to the integrated circuit over which the pixel is suspended. Historically the pixel contact structure is formed as a large sloped cone shaped structure which takes significant area away from the active sensing portion of the pixel. This is especially significant as pixel sizes are reduced.

The prior art method and structure results in a large fraction of the pixel area being used to support the pixel. This support area may not provide a signal and thus may be considered wasted space in the pixel. This large area also may not scale well and the contact structure represents an even larger fraction of the pixel area as the pixel size is reduced.

According to embodiments of the present invention microbolometer performance may be improved by replacing the large sloped cone shaped structure with a small vertically sided for example cylindrical post. This post structure can provide both mechanical support to suspend the pixel over the integrated read out circuit and provide electrical interconnect between the pixel and the integrated circuit. These support posts can be fabricated using a novel sequence of standard filling techniques found in silicon chip processing.

Embodiments of the process used to manufacture the pixel of this invention include the steps of providing a substrate depositing a sacrificial layer forming vias through the sacrificial layer filling the vias with metal removing excess material forming a microbolometer pixel structure over the filled vias and removing the sacrificial layer leaving a post supported pixel.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the process of the present invention can provide support posts and electrical contacts less than 2 microns wide and less than 4 square microns in area. The reduced area of the new method allows the area formerly used by the larger contact support structures to be used for active sensing areas of the pixels which improves the performance of current technology and enables it to be scaled to pixel sizes for next generation products.

An embodiment of the invention provides a method for manufacturing at least one microbolometer pixel comprising the steps of providing a substrate with at least one readout integrated circuit pad operatively connected to at least one readout integrated circuit depositing a sacrificial layer over the substrate forming at least one via through the sacrificial layer to the at least one readout integrated circuit pad filling the via with metal and polishing the metal to the surface of the sacrificial layer forming at least one microbolometer pixel layer over the filled via and the sacrificial layer and removing the sacrificial layer to leave at least one post supported microbolometer pixel. Embodiments include aluminum tungsten and plated metals. Embodiments also employ a chemical mechanical polishing step. Other embodiments include an organic material or dielectric material for the sacrificial layer. In further embodiments the via is formed by photo patterning and etching. Embodiments may also provide a cross section of the via of about 0.2 to 2 microns.

Yet another embodiment includes a pixel support structure comprising a post having substantially parallel sides disposed between a substrate and microbolometer pixel. It can further comprise a circuit pad disposed between the post and the substrate. Another embodiment includes a readout integrated circuit disposed on the substrate in electrical contact with the circuit pad.

A further embodiment is an infrared microbolometer sensor system comprising a focal plane array FPA comprising a plurality of pixels each having a plurality of posts having substantially parallel sides disposed between a substrate and a microbolometer pixel wherein a circuit pad is disposed between the post and the substrate. A readout integrated circuit is disposed on the substrate in electrical contact with the circuit pad. In other embodiments the post has a width of about 0.3 microns the focal plane array FPA has a fill factor of about 72 percent the frame rate is about 60 hertz and the embodiment comprises nitride. In embodiments the nitride has a thickness of about 1 500 to 2 000 angstroms. For further embodiments the system operates in a wavelength band within about 7 to 14 microns and the focal plane array FPA dimensions are 640 by 480 pixels.

The features and advantages described herein are not all inclusive and in particular many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings specification and claims. Moreover it should be noted that the language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes and not to limit the scope of the inventive subject matter.

A process for manufacturing a microbolometer pixel contact according to the present invention is described follows.

A sacrificial layer is deposited over a read out integrated circuit. A via hole is formed in the sacrificial layer. The via is then filled with metal. Excess metal over the via is removed leaving the via hole filled flush to the top with the fill metal and excess metal removed. The micromechanical pixel structure is then formed as normal over the sacrificial layer. Finally the sacrificial layer is removed to leave the pixel structure supported and electrically connected by the metal post created from the filled via.

Referring specifically to the structure A of a sacrificial layer is deposited over substrate with readout integrated circuit and metal pads that connect to the integrated circuit. The sacrificial layer may for example be a dielectric such as silicon dioxide or organic such as polyimide.

In configuration B vias are formed through the sacrificial layer to the readout integrated circuit in the substrate. This may employ standard integrated circuit IC processing techniques such as for example photo patterning and etching. The vias are for example about 0.5 to 2.0 microns.

Referring to configuration D of at least one microbolometer pixel layer is formed over the metal filled vias and sacrificial layer . The micro mechanical pixel structure is formed as is known in the art over the sacrificial layer with the pixel structure attached physically and electrically to the top of the metal in the filled via .

In configuration E the sacrificial layer is removed leaving a post supported pixel structure . The pixel structure is supported and electrically connected by the metal posts formed from the filled vias. The post is now a free standing metal stud supporting the pixel structure and electrically connecting the read out integrated circuit to the pixel structure through metal pads .

This process was used to produce imaging demonstrations including using standard 640 480 readout integrated circuits.

In summary pixel contacts of the present invention were incorporated in 17 m microbolometer focal plane arrays FPAs and demonstrated in standard production infrared cameras where they produced the presented imagery.

It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of this disclosure. It is intended that the scope of the invention be limited not by this detailed description but rather by the claims appended hereto.
