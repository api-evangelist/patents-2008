This application is a continuation in part of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 021 263 filed on Jan. 28 2008 and entitled Associating a Granting Matrix with an Analytic Platform which claims the benefit of the following U.S. provisional applications App. No. 60 886 798 filed on Jan. 26 2007 and entitled A Method of Aggregating Data App. No. 60 886 801 filed on Jan. 26 2007 and entitled Utilizing Aggregated Data. 

This invention relates to methods and systems for analyzing data and more particularly to methods and systems for aggregating projecting and releasing data.

Currently there exists a large variety of data sources such as census data or movement data received from point of sale terminals sample data received from manual surveys panel data obtained from the inputs of consumers who are members of panels fact data relating to products sales and many other facts associated with the sales and marketing efforts of an enterprise and dimension data relating to dimensions along which an enterprise wishes to understand data such as in order to analyze consumer behaviors to predict likely outcomes of decisions relating to an enterprise s activities and to project from sample sets of data to a larger universe. Conventional methods of synthesizing aggregating and exploring such a universe of data comprise techniques such as OLAP which fix aggregation points along the dimensions of the universe in order to reduce the size and complexity of unified information sets such as OLAP stars. Exploration of the unified information sets can involve run time queries and query time projections both of which are constrained in current methods by a priori decisions that must be made to project and aggregate the universe of data. In practice going back and changing the a priori decisions can lift these constraints but this requires an arduous and computationally complex restructuring and reprocessing of data.

According to current business practices unified information sets and results drawn from such information sets can be released to third parties according to so called releasability rules. Theses rules might apply to any and all of the data from which the unified information sets are drawn the dimensions or points or ranges along the dimensions the third party or members or sub organizations of the third party and so on. Given this there can be a complex interaction between the data the dimensions the third party the releasability rules the levels along the dimensions at which aggregations are performed the information that is drawn from the unified information sets and so on. In practice configuring a system to apply the releasability rules is an error prone process that requires extensive manual set up and results in a brittle mechanism that cannot adapt to on the fly changes in data dimensions third parties rules aggregations projections user queries and so on.

Various projection methodologies are known in the art. Still other projection methodologies are subjects of the present invention. In any case different projection methodologies provide outputs that have different statistical qualities. Analysts are interested in specifying the statistical qualities of the outputs at query time. In practice however the universe of data and the projection methodologies that are applied to it are what drive the statistical qualities. Existing methods allow an analyst to choose a projection methodology and thereby affect the statistical qualities of the output but this does not satisfy the analyst s desire to directly dictate the statistical qualities.

Information systems are a significant bottle neck for market analysis activities. The architecture of information systems is often not designed to provide on demand flexible access integration at a very granular level or many other critical capabilities necessary to support growth. Thus information systems are counter productive to growth. Hundreds of market and consumer databases make it very difficult to manage or integrate data. For example there may be a separate database for each data source hierarchy and other data characteristics relevant to market analysis. Different market views and product hierarchies proliferate among manufacturers and retailers. Restatements of data hierarchies waste precious time and are very expensive. Navigation from among views of data such as from global views to regional to neighborhood to store views is virtually impossible because there are different hierarchies used to store data from global to region to neighborhood to store level data. Analyses and insights often take weeks or months or they are never produced. Insights are often sub optimal because of silo driven narrowly defined ad hoc analysis projects. Reflecting the ad hoc nature of these analytic projects are the analytic tools and infrastructure developed to support them. Currently market analysis business intelligence and the like often use rigid data cubes that may include hundreds of databases that are impossible to integrate. These systems may include hundreds of views hierarchies clusters and so forth each of which is associated with its own rigid data cube. This may make it almost impossible to navigate from global uses that are used for example to develop overall company strategy down to specific program implementation or customer driven uses. These ad hoc analytic tools and infrastructure are fragmented and disconnected.

In sum there are many problems associated with the data used for market analysis and there is a need for a flexible extendable analytic platform the architecture for which is designed to support a broad array of evolving market analysis needs. Furthermore there is a need for better business intelligence in order to accelerate revenue growth make business intelligence more customer driven to gain insights about markets in a more timely fashion and a need for data projection and release methods and systems that provide improved dimensional flexibility reduced query time computational complexity automatic selection and blending of projection methodologies and flexibly applied releasability rules.

Other fact data sources may include custom shelf audit files shipment data files media data files explanatory data e.g. data regarding weather attitudinal data or usage data. Dimension data sources may include information relating to any dimensions along which an enterprise wishes to collect data such as dimensions relating to products sold e.g. attribute data relating to the types of products that are sold such as data about UPC codes product hierarchies categories brands sub brands SKUs and the like venue data e.g. store chain region country etc. time data e.g. day week quad week quarter 12 week etc. geographic data including breakdowns of stores by city state region country or other geographic groupings consumer or customer data e.g. household individual demographics household groupings etc. and other dimension data sources . While embodiments disclosed herein relate primarily to the collection of sales and marketing related facts and the handling of dimensions related to the sales and marketing activities of an enterprise it should be understood that the methods and systems disclosed herein may be applied to facts of other types and to the handling of dimensions of other types such as facts and dimensions related to manufacturing activities financial activities information technology activities media activities supply chain management activities accounting activities political activities contracting activities and many others.

In an embodiment the analytic platform comprises a combination of data technologies methods and delivery mechanisms brought together by an analytic engine. The analytic platform may provide a novel approach to managing and integrating market and enterprise information and enabling predictive analytics. The analytic platform may leverage approaches to representing and storing the base data so that it may be consumed and delivered in real time with flexibility and open integration. This representation of the data when combined with the analytic methods and techniques and a delivery infrastructure may minimize the processing time and cost and maximize the performance and value for the end user. This technique may be applied to problems where there may be a need to access integrated views across multiple data sources where there may be a large multi dimensional data repository against which there may be a need to rapidly and accurately handle dynamic dimensionality requests with appropriate aggregations and projections where there may be highly personalized and flexible real time reporting analysis and forecasting capabilities required where there may be a need to tie seamlessly and on the fly with other enterprise applications via web services such as to receive a request with specific dimensionality apply appropriate calculation methods perform and deliver an outcome e.g. dataset coefficient etc. and the like.

The analytic platform may provide innovative solutions to application partners including on demand pricing insights emerging category insights product launch management loyalty insights daily data out of stock insights assortment planning on demand audit groups neighborhood insights shopper insights health and wellness insights consumer tracking and targeting and the like.

A decision framework may enable new revenue and competitive advantages to application partners by brand building product innovation consumer centric retail execution consumer and shopper relationship management and the like. Predictive planning and optimization solutions automated analytics and insight solutions and on demand business performance reporting may be drawn from a plurality of sources such as InfoScan total C scan daily data panel data retailer direct data SAP consumer segmentation consumer demographics FSP loyalty data data provided directly for customers or the like.

The analytic platform may have advantages over more traditional federation consolidation approaches requiring fewer updates in a smaller portion of the process. The analytic platform may support greater insight to users and provide users with more innovative applications. The analytic platform may provide a unified reporting and solutions framework providing on demand and scheduled reports in a user dashboard with summary views and graphical dial indicators as well as flexible formatting options. Benefits and products of the analytic platform may include non additive measures for custom product groupings elimination of restatements to save significant time and effort cross category visibility to spot emerging trends provide a total market picture for faster competitor analysis provide granular data on demand to view detailed retail performance provide attribute driven analysis for market insights and the like.

The analytic capabilities of the present invention may provide for on demand projection on demand aggregation multi source master data management and the like. On demand projection may be derived directly for all possible geographies store and demographic attributes per geography or category with built in dynamic releasability controls and the like. On demand aggregation may provide both additive and non additive measures provide custom groups provide cross category or geography analytics and the like. Multi source master data management may provide management of dimension member catalogue and hierarchy attributes processing of raw fact data that may reduce harmonization work to attribute matching product and store attributes stored relationally with data that may be extended independently of fact data and used to create additional dimensions and the like.

In addition the analytic platform may provide flexibility while maintaining a structured user approach. Flexibility may be realized with multiple hierarchies applied to the same database the ability to create new custom hierarchies and views rapid addition of new measures and dimensions and the like. The user may be provided a structured approach through publishing and subscribing reports to a broader user base by enabling multiple user classes with different privileges providing security access and the like. The user may also be provided with increased performance and ease of use through leading edge hardware and software and web application for integrated analysis.

In embodiments the data available within a fact data source and a dimension data source may be linked such as through the use of a key. For example key based fusion of fact and dimension data may occur by using a key such as using the Abilitec Key software product offered by Acxiom in order to fuse multiple sources of data. For example such a key can be used to relate loyalty card data e.g. Grocery Store loyalty card Grocery Store loyalty card and Convenience Store loyalty card that are available for a single customer so that the fact data from multiple sources can be used as a fused data source for analysis on desirable dimensions. For example an analyst might wish to view time series trends in the dollar sales allotted by the customer to each store within a given product category.

In embodiments the data loading facility may comprise any of a wide range of data loading facilities including or using suitable connectors bridges adaptors extraction engines transformation engines loading engines data filtering facilities data cleansing facilities data integration facilities or the like of the type known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In various embodiments there are many situations where a store will provide POS data and causal information relating to its store. For example the POS data may be automatically transmitted to the facts database after the sales information has been collected at the stores POS terminals. The same store may also provide information about how it promoted certain products its store or the like. This data may be stored in another database however this causal information may provide one with insight on recent sales activities so it may be used in later sales assessments or forecasts. Similarly a manufacturer may load product attribute data into yet another database and this data may also be accessible for sales assessment or projection analysis. For example when making such analysis one may be interested in knowing what categories of products sold well or what brand sold well. In this case the causal store information may be aggregated with the POS data and dimension data corresponding to the products referred to in the POS data. With this aggregation of information one can make an analysis on any of the related data.

Referring still to data that is obtained by the data loading facility may be transferred to a plurality of facilities within the analytic platform including the data mart . In embodiments the data loading facility may contain one or more interfaces by which the data loaded by the data loading facility may interact with or be used by other facilities within the platform or external to the platform. Interfaces to the data loading facility may include human readable user interfaces application programming interfaces APIs registries or similar facilities suitable for providing interfaces to services in a services oriented architecture connectors bridges adaptors bindings protocols message brokers extraction facilities transformation facilities loading facilities and other data integration facilities suitable for allowing various other entities to interact with the data loading facility .

These interfaces may comprise interfaces to the platform as a whole or may be interfaces associated directly with the data mart facility itself such as for access from other components of the platform or for access by external entities directly to the data mart facility . The interfaces may support interactions with the data mart facility by applications solutions reporting facilities analyses facilities services each of which is describe in greater detail herein or other entities external to or internal to an enterprise.

In certain optional embodiments the security facility may be any hardware or software implementation process procedure or protocol that may be used to block limit filter or alter access to the data mart facility and or any of the facilities within the data mart facility by a human operator a group of operators an organization software program bot virus or some other entity or program. The security facility may include a firewall an anti virus facility a facility for managing permission to store manipulate and or retrieve data or metadata a conditional access facility a logging facility a tracking facility a reporting facility an asset management facility an intrusion detection facility an intrusion prevention facility or other suitable security facility.

Still referring to the analytic platform may include an analytic engine . The analytic engine may be used to build and deploy analytic applications or solutions or undertake analytic methods based upon the use of a plurality of data sources and data types. Among other things the analytic engine may perform a wide range of calculations and data manipulation steps necessary to apply models such as mathematical and economic models to sets of data including fact data dimension data and metadata. The analytic engine may be associated with an interface such as any of the interfaces described herein.

The analytic engine may interact with a model storage facility which may be any facility for generating models used in the analysis of sets of data such as economic models econometric models forecasting models decision support models estimation models projection models and many others. In embodiments output from the analytic engine may be used to condition or refine models in the model storage thus there may be a feedback loop between the two where calculations in the analytic engine are used to refine models managed by the model storage facility .

In embodiments a security facility of the analytic engine may be the same or similar to the security facility associated with the data mart facility as described herein. Alternatively the security facility associated with the analytic engine may have features and rules that are specifically designed to operate within the analytic engine .

As illustrated in the analytic platform may contain a master data management hub MDMH . In embodiments the MDMH may serve as a central facility for handling dimension data used within the analytic platform such as data about products stores venues geographies time periods and the like as well as various other dimensions relating to or associated with the data and metadata types in the data sources the data loading facility the data mart facility the analytic engine the model storage facility or various applications solutions reporting facilities analytic facilities or services that interact with the analytic platform . The MDMH may in embodiments include a security facility an interface a data loader a data manipulation and structuring facility and one or more staging tables . The data loader may be used to receive data. Data may enter the MDMH from various sources such as from the data mart after the data mart completes its intended processing of the information and data that it received as described herein. Data may also enter the MDMH through a user interface such as an API or a human user interface web browser or some other interface of any of the types disclosed herein or in the documents incorporated by reference herein. The user interface may be deployed on a client device such as a PDA personal computer laptop computer cellular phone or some other client device capable of handling data. In embodiments the staging tables may be included in the MDMH .

In embodiments a matching facility may be associated with the MDMH . The matching facility may receive an input data hierarchy within the MDMH and analyze the characteristics of the hierarchy and select a set of attributes that are salient to a particular analytic interest e.g. product selection by a type of consumer product sales by a type of venue and so forth . The matching facility may select primary attributes match attributes associate attributes block attributes and prioritize the attributes. The matching facility may associate each attribute with a weight and define a set of probabilistic weights. The probabilistic weights may be the probability of a match or a non match or thresholds of a match or non match that is associated with an analytic purpose e.g. product purchase . The probabilistic weights may then be used in an algorithm that is run within a probabilistic matching engine e.g. IBM QualityStage . The output of the matching engine may provide information on for example other products which are appropriate to include in a data hierarchy the untapped market i.e. other venues in which a product is probabilistically more likely to sell well and so forth. In embodiments the matching facility may be used to generate projections of what types of products people customers retailers stores store departments etc. are similar in nature and therefore they may be appropriate to combine in a projection or an assessment.

As illustrated in the analytic platform may include a projection facility . A projection facility may be used to produce projections whereby a partial data set such as data from a subset of stores of a chain is projected to a universe such as all of the stores in a chain by applying appropriate weights to the data in the partial data set. A wide range of potential projection methodologies exist including cell based methodologies store matrix methodologies iterative proportional fitting methodologies virtual census methodologies and others. The methodologies can be used to generate projection factors. As to any given projection there is typically a tradeoff among various statistical quality measurements associated with that type of projection. Some projections are more accurate than others while some are more consistent have less spillage are more closely calibrated or have other attributes that make them relatively more or less desirable depending on how the output of the projection is likely to be used. In embodiments of the platform the projection facility takes dimension information from the MDMH or from another source and provides a set of projection weightings along the applicable dimensions typically reflected in a matrix of projection weights which can be applied at the data mart facility to a partial data set in order to render a projected data set. The projection facility may have an interface of any of the types disclosed herein.

As shown in an interface may be included in the analytic platform . In embodiments data may be transferred to the MDMH of the platform using a user interface . The interface may be a web browser operating over the Internet or within an intranet or other network it may be an analytic engine an application plug in or some other user interface that is capable of handling data. The interface may be human readable or may consist of one or more application programming interfaces or it may include various connectors adaptors bridges services transformation facilities extraction facilities loading facilities bindings couplings or other data integration facilities including any such facilities described herein or in documents incorporated by reference herein.

As illustrated in the platform may interact with a variety of applications solutions reporting facilities analytic facilities and services such as web services or with other platforms or systems of an enterprise or external to an enterprise. Any such applications solutions reporting facilities analytic facilities and services may interact with the platform in a variety of ways such as providing input to the platform such as data metadata dimension information models projections or the like taking output from the platform such as data metadata projection information information about similarities analytic output output from calculations or the like modifying the platform including in a feedback or iterative loop being modified by the platform again optionally in a feedback or iterative loop or the like.

In embodiments one or more applications or solutions may interact with the platform via an interface . Applications and solutions may include applications and solutions consisting of a combination of hardware software and methods among other components that relate to planning the sales and marketing activities of an enterprise decision support applications financial reporting applications applications relating to strategic planning enterprise dashboard applications supply chain management applications inventory management and ordering applications manufacturing applications customer relationship management applications information technology applications applications relating to purchasing applications relating to pricing promotion positioning placement and products and a wide range of other applications and solutions.

In embodiments applications and solutions may include analytic output that is organized around a topic area. For example the organizing principle of an application or a solution may be a new product introduction. Manufacturers may release thousands of new products each year. It may be useful for an analytic platform to be able to group analysis around the topic area such as new products and organize a bundle of analyses and workflows that are presented as an application or solution . Applications and solutions may incorporate planning information forecasting information what if. scenario capability and other analytic features. Applications and solutions may be associated with web services that enable users within a client s organization to access and work with the applications and solutions .

In embodiments the analytic platform may facilitate delivering information to external applications . This may include providing data or analytic results to certain classes of applications . For example and without limitation an application may include enterprise resource planning backbone applications such as SAP including those applications focused on Marketing Sales Operations Planning and Supply Chain Management. In another example an application may include business intelligence applications including those applications that may apply data mining techniques. In another example an application may include customer relationship management applications including customer sales force applications . In another example an application may include specialty applications such as a price or SKU optimization application. The analytic platform may facilitate supply chain efficiency applications . For example and without limitation an application may include supply chain models based on sales out POS FSP rather than sales in Shipments . In another example an application may include RFID based supply chain management. In another example an application may include a retailer co op to enable partnership with a distributor who may manage collective stock and distribution services. The analytic platform may be applied to industries characterized by large multi dimensional data structures. This may include industries such as telecommunications elections and polling and the like. The analytic platform may be applied to opportunities to vend large amounts of data through a portal with the possibility to deliver highly customized views for individual users with effectively controlled user accessibility rights. This may include collaborative groups such as insurance brokers real estate agents and the like. The analytic platform may be applied to applications requiring self monitoring of critical coefficients and parameters. Such applications may rely on constant updating of statistical models such as financial models with real time flows of data and ongoing re calibration and optimization. The analytic platform may be applied to applications that require breaking apart and recombining geographies and territories at will.

In embodiments a dimensional compression facility may be associated with the data mart . The dimensional compression facility may perform operations procedures calculations data manipulations and the like which are in part designed to compress a dataset using techniques such as a causal bitmap fake. A causal bitmap fake facility may be associated with the data mart . A causal bitmap may refer to a collection of various attributes in a data set that are associated with causal facts such as facts about whether a product was discounted the nature of the display for a product whether a product was a subject of a special promotion whether the product was present in a store at all and many others. It is possible to analyze and store a pre aggregated set of data reflecting all possible permutations and combinations of the attributes potentially present in the causal bitmap however the resulting dataset may be very large and burdensome when components of the platform perform calculations resulting in slow run times. Also the resulting aggregated data set may contain many combinations and permutations for which there is no analytic interest. The causal bitmap fake facility may be used to reduce the number of permutations and combinations down to a data set that only includes those that are of analytic interest. Thus the causal bitmap fake may include creation of an intermediate representation of permutations and combinations of attributes of a causal bitmap where permutations and combinations are pre selected for their analytic interest in order to reduce the number of permutations and combinations that are stored for purposes of further analysis or calculation. The causal bitmap fake compression technique may improve query performance and reduce processing time.

Causal Bitmap Fake may be an intermediate table for use as a bridge table in data analysis the bridge table containing only those causal permutations of the fact data that are of interest. It will be appreciated from the following disclosure that the causal bitmap fake may reduce the number rows in the bridge table by a significant factor increasing the speed with which aggregation or pre aggregation queries may be applied with respect to the table and thereby increasing the range and flexibility of queries that may be applied in or near real time to the fact data or an aggregation or pre aggregation thereof In essence the causal bitmap fake may involve utilizing and or producing a bitmap that encodes combinations of causal data. In embodiments the causal data may relate to merchandising activity and may without limitation encode an item feature display price reduction special pack special feature enhanced feature special display special price reduction special census and so on. Instead of generating a bridge table that encodes all possible permutations of the bitmap such a table may contain half a million or more rows in practice the causal bitmap fake utilizes and or produces a bridge table containing only the permutations of interest the permutations that represent combinations of merchandising activity that are probable or possible or the like. In practice such bridge tables may contain tens or hundreds of rows. As a result an aggregation query or other queries that involves a cross join between permutations of causal data and other facts or dimensions may involve far fewer calculations and result in a much smaller result set than would have been the case if all permutations of causal data were considered. In practice it may be possible to recalculate the bridge table when the permutations of causal data in question become known and or when the permutations in question change. By doing this the bridge table may only contain the permutations in question and so calculating aggregations which may involve processing the entire bridge table may still be done rapidly as compared with an approach that considers a bridge table that contains all possible permutations.

An aspect of the present invention relates to dimensional compression. A data or dimensional compression and aggregations of data may be done prior to in anticipation of and or following a query. Referring to a data mart facility may allow storage of data and metadata about facts including sales facts causal facts and the like and dimension data as well as other relevant data and metadata. In embodiments the data mart facility may compress the data and or create summaries in order to facilitate faster processing by other of the applications within the platform . Further the data mart may include a dimensional compression facility a causal bitmap facility located within the dimensional compression facility . The dimensional compression facility may perform operations procedures calculations data manipulations and the like which are in part designed to compress a dataset using techniques such as a causal bitmap fake. The causal bitmap may refer to a collection of various attributes in a data set that may be associated with causal facts such as facts about whether a product was discounted the nature of the display for a product whether a product was a subject of a special promotion whether the product was present in a store at all and many others. The causal bitmap fake compression technique may improve query performance and reduce processing time.

In embodiments referring to systems and methods may involve using a platform as disclosed herein for applications described herein where the systems and methods involve receiving a causal fact dataset including facts relating to items perceived to cause actions wherein the causal fact dataset includes a data attribute that is associated with a causal fact datum . It may also involve pre aggregating a plurality of the combinations of a plurality of causal fact data and associated data attributes in a causal bitmap . It may also involve selecting a subset of the pre aggregated combinations based on suitability of a combination for the analytic purpose . It may also involve storing the subset of pre aggregated combinations to facilitate querying of the subset .
