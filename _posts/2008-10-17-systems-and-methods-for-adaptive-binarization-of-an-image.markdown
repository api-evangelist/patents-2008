The patent applications below including the present patent application are filed concurrently and share a common title and disclosure each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety 

In the area of digital image processing and automated reading of text on digital images the images often get thresholded i.e. binarized from a grayscale image to a binary image. Image binarization converts an image of up to 256 gray levels to a black and white image. Frequently binarization is used as a pre processor before optical character recognition OCR or intelligent character recognition ICR . In fact most OCR packages on the market work only on bi level black white images. The simplest way to use image binarization is to choose a threshold value and classify all pixels with values above this threshold as white and all other pixels as black. The problem then is how to select the correct threshold. In many cases finding one threshold compatible to the entire image is very difficult and in many cases even impossible.

For example in the banking industry areas of interest to be automatically read from a digital image of a personal check may include text in the magnetic ink character recognition MICR line of the check or the handwritten amount on the check. Often people put checks in their pockets which causes fold lines on the check. These fold lines often come up as gray areas around objects of interest such as the MICR line of the check the handwritten amount on the check the payee etc. When OCR or ICR software fails to read these areas a person must look at the check and manually key in these amounts. Also this may cause difficulty in converting the check image to a binary image to be sent as an image cash letter for regulatory compliance. This results in more money being spent on people to manually review bad check images due to poor binarization conversion for certain check images.

However the program s can be implemented in assembly or machine language if desired. In any case the language may be a compiled or interpreted language and combined with hardware implementations.

Although exemplary embodiments may refer to utilizing aspects of the embodiments in the context of one or more stand alone computer systems the embodiments are not so limited but rather may be implemented in connection with any computing environment such as a network or distributed computing environment. Still further aspects of the embodiments may be implemented in or across a plurality of processing chips or devices and storage may similarly be effected across a plurality of devices. Such devices might include personal computers network servers handheld devices supercomputers or computers integrated into other systems such as automobiles and airplanes.

Referring next to shown is an exemplary networked computing environment in which many computerized processes may be implemented to perform the processes described below. For example parallel computing may be part of such a networked environment with various clients on the network of using and or implementing processes for binarization of an image. One of ordinary skill in the art can appreciate that networks can connect any computer or other client or server device or in a distributed computing environment. In this regard any computer system or environment having any number of processing memory or storage units and any number of applications and processes occurring simultaneously is considered suitable for use in connection with the systems and methods provided.

Distributed computing provides sharing of computer resources and services by exchange between computing devices and systems. These resources and services include the exchange of information cache storage and disk storage for files. Distributed computing takes advantage of network connectivity allowing clients to leverage their collective power to benefit the entire enterprise. In this regard a variety of devices may have applications objects or resources that may implicate the processes described herein.

This network may itself comprise other computing entities that provide services to the system of and may itself represent multiple interconnected networks. In accordance with aspects of the embodiments each entity and may contain discrete functional program modules that might make use of an API or other object software firmware and or hardware to request services of one or more of the other entities and .

It can also be appreciated that an object such as may be hosted on another computing device . Thus although the physical environment depicted may show the connected devices as computers such illustration is merely exemplary and the physical environment may alternatively be depicted or described comprising various digital devices such as PDAs televisions MP3 players etc. software objects such as interfaces COM objects and the like.

There are a variety of systems components and network configurations that support distributed computing environments. For example computing systems may be connected together by wired or wireless systems by local networks or widely distributed networks. Currently many networks are coupled to the Internet which provides an infrastructure for widely distributed computing and encompasses many different networks. Any such infrastructures whether coupled to the Internet or not may be used in conjunction with the systems and methods provided.

A network infrastructure may enable a host of network topologies such as client server peer to peer or hybrid architectures. The client is a member of a class or group that uses the services of another class or group to which it is not related. In computing a client is a process i.e. roughly a set of instructions or tasks that requests a service provided by another program. The client process utilizes the requested service without having to know any working details about the other program or the service itself. In a client server architecture particularly a networked system a client is usually a computer that accesses shared network resources provided by another computer e.g. a server. In the example of any entity and can be considered a client a server or both depending on the circumstances.

A server is typically though not necessarily a remote computer system accessible over a remote or local network such as the Internet. The client process may be active in a first computer system and the server process may be active in a second computer system communicating with one another over a communications medium thus providing distributed functionality and allowing multiple clients to take advantage of the information gathering capabilities of the server. Any software objects may be distributed across multiple computing devices or objects.

Client s and server s communicate with one another utilizing the functionality provided by protocol layer s . For example HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP is a common protocol that is used in conjunction with the World Wide Web WWW or the Web. Typically a computer network address such as an Internet Protocol IP address or other reference such as a Universal Resource Locator URL can be used to identify the server or client computers to each other. The network address can be referred to as a URL address. Communication can be provided over a communications medium e.g. client s and server s may be coupled to one another via TCP IP connection s for high capacity communication.

In light of the diverse computing environments that may be built according to the general framework provided in and the further diversification that can occur in computing in a network environment such as that of the systems and methods provided herein cannot be construed as limited in any way to a particular computing architecture. Instead the embodiments should be construed in breadth and scope in accordance with the appended claims.

Referring next to shown are a flow chart illustrating an example overall process for binarization of an image and a flow chart showing an example image to binarize and an example sub image of the image before binarization and after binarization. First an entire grayscale image is acquired . The example image shown in is that of a personal check. The image may be acquired by use of a scanner such as a home scanner or digital camera for example. Then the number of tiles sub images that the image will be broken down into is calculated and the image is broken down into those sub images. An example sub image of the example image before binarization is shown on . For example the example sub image was taken at pt of the check image with a width of 100 and height of 50. The number of sub images may vary. However the more sub images that are used generally the better the resulting binarized image will be. For each sub image a histogram is then generated . Referring next additionally to shown is an example histogram chart of a sub image of an image to binarize. The X axis is the gray value and the Y axis is the number of counts of gray.

Thresholding values for image binarization are then determined using statistical analysis of the histogram . The image is then binarized by using the determined threshold values for each sub image to binarize the entire image. An example of a resulting binarized sub image is shown in . Once the image is binarized then further processing of the image may be performed such as optical character recognition etc. For example once the check image is binarized information such as the magnetic ink character recognition MICR characters and the written amount of the check may be more easily recognized and read from the image .

Referring next to shown is a flow chart illustrating an example process for determining threshold values for binarization of an image. First the point having the highest Y value counts of gray on the histogram is found. This point is called second high for the present example since it was noticed that there is a pattern among check images that there are usually at least two peaks. However that that is not always the case. Then the process proceeds to find the point on the histogram having second highest Y value. This point is called first high for the present example. In theory first high is the first high value on the left of the histogram before the second high. The indexed gray value is also tracked for these high values first high and second high.

First high is found by going from left to right on the histogram and comparing the number of counts Y of each indexed value X to the previous value until the reaching a right X limit. This is started with a maximum value number of gray level counts being the gray level count Y at point 0 0 of the histogram. 0 0 point of the histogram may be also known as the number of gray value counts for gray value zero. The right X limit going from left to right is set to the Mode M unless the second high X value is less than the Mode M . In which case the right traversing limit becomes second high. The first high gray index X value is then obtained. For discrete distributions the mode is the value with the greatest frequency and for continuous distributions it is the point where the probability density is at a maximum. It is possible for a distribution to have two or more modes.

Next the lowest Y value traversing from left to right called first min is found on the histogram. Also the lowest Y value traversing from right to left called second min is found . The process for finding first min and second min is similar in procedure to finding first high and second high with the exception that the process looks for the minimum value traversing from left to right on the histogram bounded by the first high and the mode M looking for the lesser Y number of the next value. The resulting point found is called first min. first min may be set to 0 by default. If nothing is found the index gray value is at point 0 0 or the gray value count for gray value zero black . The process then finds second min but this time traversing from right to left on the histogram bounded by first min and second high and starting at second high. The process determined whether the next number is smaller than the current number at hand to find the minimum value. This results in second min.

first min and second min are then adjusted in special cases. One case is that sometimes first min and second min are the same number. In this case the process checks if the second min is greater than a Boundary B . Boundaries B and B are calculated such that B is the boundary of data encompassing most of the histogram past a certain noticeable magnitude of order in gray value counts and B is the boundary of the histogram such that noticeable magnitudes of order converge to tiny count or zero from the histogram as it approaches 255. It is conceivable that the image boundaries may be 0 and 255 if there exists a full gray value usage for a given image. This is unlikely. If the image tiled into pieces it most likely result in a subset of the full 255 gray values that contain gray value counts. If the second min is greater than a Boundary B which most likely is the case second min is reset to be the result of the difference of second min minus my standard deviation times a scaling constant k . In this case a recommended scaling constant is k 0.3. Thus the adjusted second min would be second min Q 0.3 . The first min then becomes boundary B . The next special case is when first min is equal to a number greater than zero and second min returns empty or by default is 0. In this case second min now becomes first min and first min is set. Then the process subtracts the standard deviation multiplying by a scaling constant k. In this case a recommended scaling constant is k 1.

Thresholding values are then determined using first min and second min for the lower and higher boundaries. To do this an image processing clamp method is called with input as the boundary gray level values first min and second min. The clamp function may be defined as 

Known binarization methods may then be used with the resulting image of the clamp process as input. The resulting image is a binarized generally black and white pixel image. Thus the overall image is binarized based on the uniqueness of each of the sub images processed. The current sub image thresholding values are based on the processes described above to find the values to improve the image quality for the next stages of image processing.
