The following Australian provisional patent applications are hereby incorporated by cross reference. For the purposes of location and identification US patent applications identified by their US patent application serial numbers USSN or patent numbers are listed alongside the Australian applications from which the US patent applications claim the right of priority.

The present invention relates to the field of inkjet printing and in particular discloses an inverted radial back curling thermoelastic ink jet printing mechanism.

Many different types of printing mechanisms have been invented a large number of which are presently in use. The known forms of printers have a variety of methods for marking the print media with a relevant marking media. Commonly used forms of printing include offset printing laser printing and copying devices dot matrix type impact printers thermal paper printers film recorders thermal wax printers dye sublimation printers and ink jet printers both of the drop on demand and continuous flow type. Each type of printer has its own advantages and problems when considering cost speed quality reliability simplicity of construction and operation etc.

In recent years the field of ink jet printing wherein each individual pixel of ink is derived from one or more ink nozzles has become increasingly popular primarily due to its inexpensive and versatile nature.

Many different techniques of ink jet printing have been invented. For a survey of the field reference is made to an article by J Moore Non Impact Printing Introduction and Historical Perspective Output Hard Copy Devices Editors R Dubeck and S Sherr pages 207 220 1988 .

Ink Jet printers themselves come in many different forms. The utilization of a continuous stream of ink in ink jet printing appears to date back to at least 1929 wherein U.S. Pat. No. 1 941 001 by Hansell discloses a simple form of continuous stream electro static ink jet printing.

U.S. Pat. No. 3 596 275 by Sweet also discloses a process of a continuous ink jet printing including a step wherein the ink jet stream is modulated by a high frequency electro static field so as to cause drop separation. This technique is still utilized by several manufacturers including Elmjet and Scitex see also U.S. Pat. No. 3 373 437 by Sweet et al .

Piezoelectric ink jet printers are also one form of commonly utilized ink jet printing device. Piezoelectric systems are disclosed by Kyser et. al. in U.S. Pat. No. 3 946 398 1970 which utilizes a diaphragm mode of operation by Zolten in U.S. Pat. No. 3 683 212 1970 which discloses a squeeze mode form of operation of a piezoelectric crystal Stemme in U.S. Pat. No. 3 747 120 1972 which discloses a bend mode of piezoelectric operation Howkins in U.S. Pat. No. 4 459 601 which discloses a piezoelectric push mode actuation of the ink jet stream and Fischbeck in U.S. Pat. No. 4 584 590 which discloses a shear mode type of piezoelectric transducer element.

Recently thermal ink jet printing has become an extremely popular form of ink jet printing. The ink jet printing techniques include those disclosed by Endo et al in GB 2007162 1979 and Vaught et al in U.S. Pat. No. 4 490 728. Both the aforementioned references disclose ink jet printing techniques which rely on the activation of an electrothermal actuator which results in the creation of a bubble in a constricted space such as a nozzle which thereby causes the ejection of ink from an aperture connected to the confined space onto a relevant print media. Printing devices utilizing the electro thermal actuator are manufactured by manufacturers such as Canon and Hewlett Packard.

As can be seen from the foregoing many different types of printing technologies are available. Ideally a printing technology should have a number of desirable attributes. These include inexpensive construction and operation high speed operation safe and continuous long term operation etc. Each technology may have its own advantages and disadvantages in the areas of cost speed quality reliability power usage simplicity of construction and operation durability and consumables.

According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided an inkjet printhead chip that comprises

a plurality of nozzle arrangements that are positioned on the substrate each nozzle arrangement including

Each actuator may include an actuator arm that is connected to the drive circuitry layer and extends towards the ink ejection port. A heating circuit may be embedded in the actuator arm to receive the electrical signal from the drive circuitry layer. The actuator arm may be of a material that has a coefficient of thermal expansion sufficient to permit the material to perform work as a result of thermal expansion and contraction. The heating circuit may be positioned so that the actuator arm is subjected to differential thermal expansion and contraction to displace the actuator arm towards and away from the respective ink supply channel.

Each actuator arm may be of polytetrafluoroethylene while each heating circuit may be one of the materials in a group including gold and copper.

Each actuator arm may include an actuating portion that is connected to the drive circuitry layer. An ink displacement member may be positioned on the actuating portion to extend towards the ink ejection port.

Each roof structure may include a rim that defines the ink ejection port the rim being supported above the respective ink inlet channel with support arms that extend from the rim to the drive circuitry layer. The actuator arms may be interposed between consecutive support arms.

According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided a nozzle arrangement for an ink jet printhead the arrangement comprising a nozzle chamber defined in a wafer substrate for the storage of ink to be ejected an ink ejection port having a rim formed on one wall of the chamber and a series of actuators attached to the wafer substrate and forming a portion of the wall of the nozzle chamber adjacent the rim the actuator paddles further being actuated in unison so as to eject ink from the nozzle chamber via the ink ejection nozzle.

According to a third aspect of the invention there is provided an ink jet nozzle arrangement comprising 

an actuator for effecting ejection of ink from the chamber through the ink ejection port on demand the actuator being formed in the first wall of the nozzle chamber 

wherein said actuator extends substantially from said ink ejection port to other walls defining the nozzle chamber.

The actuators can include a surface which bends inwards away from the centre of the nozzle chamber upon actuation. The actuators are preferably actuated by means of a thermal actuator device. The thermal actuator device may comprise a conductive resistive heating element encased within a material having a high coefficient of thermal expansion. The element can be serpentine to allow for substantially unhindered expansion of the material. The actuators are preferably arranged radially around the nozzle rim.

The actuators can form a membrane between the nozzle chamber and an external atmosphere of the arrangement and the actuators bend away from the external atmosphere to cause an increase in pressure within the nozzle chamber thereby initiating a consequential ejection of ink from the nozzle chamber. The actuators can bend away from a central axis of the nozzle chamber.

The nozzle arrangement can be formed on the wafer substrate utilizing micro electro mechanical techniques and further can comprise an ink supply channel in communication with the nozzle chamber. The ink supply channel may be etched through the wafer. The nozzle arrangement may include a series of struts which support the nozzle rim.

The arrangement can be formed adjacent to neighbouring arrangements so as to form a pagewidth printhead.

In the preferred embodiment ink is ejected out of a nozzle chamber via an ink ejection port using a series of radially positioned thermal actuator devices that are arranged about the ink ejection port and are activated to pressurize the ink within the nozzle chamber thereby causing the ejection of ink through the ejection port.

Turning now to and there is illustrated the basic operational principles of the preferred embodiment. illustrates a single nozzle arrangement in its quiescent state. The arrangement includes a nozzle chamber which is normally filled with ink so as to form a meniscus in an ink ejection port . The nozzle chamber is formed within a wafer . The nozzle chamber is supplied with ink via an ink supply channel which is etched through the wafer with a highly isotropic plasma etching system. A suitable etcher can be the Advance Silicon Etch ASE system available from Surface Technology Systems of the United Kingdom.

A top of the nozzle arrangement includes a series of radially positioned actuators . These actuators comprise a polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE layer and an internal serpentine copper core . Upon heating of the copper core the surrounding PTFE expands rapidly resulting in a generally downward movement of the actuators . Hence when it is desired to eject ink from the ink ejection port a current is passed through the actuators which results in them bending generally downwards as illustrated in . The downward bending movement of the actuators results in a substantial increase in pressure within the nozzle chamber . The increase in pressure in the nozzle chamber results in an expansion of the meniscus as illustrated in .

The actuators are activated only briefly and subsequently deactivated. Consequently the situation is as illustrated in with the actuators returning to their original positions. This results in a general inflow of ink back into the nozzle chamber and a necking and breaking of the meniscus resulting in the ejection of a drop . The necking and breaking of the meniscus is a consequence of the forward momentum of the ink associated with drop and the backward pressure experienced as a result of the return of the actuators to their original positions. The return of the actuators also results in a general inflow of ink from the channel as a result of surface tension effects and eventually the state returns to the quiescent position as illustrated in .

In there is illustrated a side perspective view of one embodiment of a nozzle arrangement constructed in accordance with the principles previously outlined. The nozzle chamber is formed with an isotropic surface etch of the wafer . The wafer can include a CMOS layer including all the required power and drive circuits. Further the actuators each have a leaf or petal formation which extends towards a nozzle rim defining the ejection port . The normally inner end of each leaf or petal formation is displaceable with respect to the nozzle rim . Each activator has an internal copper core defining the element . The core winds in a serpentine manner to provide for substantially unhindered expansion of the actuators . The operation of the actuators is as illustrated in and such that upon activation the actuators bend as previously described resulting in a displacement of each petal formation away from the nozzle rim and into the nozzle chamber . The ink supply channel can be created via a deep silicon back edge of the wafer utilizing a plasma etcher or the like. The copper or aluminium core can provide a complete circuit. A central arm which can include both metal and PTFE portions provides the main structural support for the actuators .

Turning now to to one form of manufacture of the nozzle arrangement in accordance with the principles of the preferred embodiment is shown. The nozzle arrangement is preferably manufactured using microelectromechanical MEMS techniques and can include the following construction techniques 

As shown initially in the initial processing starting material is a standard semi conductor wafer having a complete CMOS level to a first level of metal. The first level of metal includes portions which are utilized for providing power to the thermal actuators .

The first step as illustrated in is to etch a nozzle region down to the silicon wafer utilizing an appropriate mask.

Next as illustrated in a 2 m layer of polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE is deposited and etched so as to define vias for interconnecting multiple levels.

Next as illustrated in the second level metal layer is deposited masked and etched to define a heater structure . The heater structure includes via interconnected with a lower aluminium layer.

Next as illustrated in a further 2 m layer of PTFE is deposited and etched to the depth of 1 m utilizing a nozzle rim mask to define the nozzle rim in addition to ink flow guide rails which generally restrain any wicking along the surface of the PTFE layer. The guide rails surround small thin slots and as such surface tension effects are a lot higher around these slots which in turn results in minimal outflow of ink during operation.

Next as illustrated in the PTFE is etched utilizing a nozzle and actuator mask to define a port portion and slots and .

Next as illustrated in the wafer is crystallographically etched on a plane utilizing a standard crystallographic etchant such as KOH. The etching forms a chamber directly below the port portion .

In the ink supply channel can be etched from the back of the wafer utilizing a highly anisotropic etcher such as the STS etcher from Silicon Technology Systems of United Kingdom. An array of ink jet nozzles can be formed simultaneously with a portion of an array being illustrated in . A portion of the printhead is formed simultaneously and diced by the STS etching process. The array shown provides for four column printing with each separate column attached to a different colour ink supply channel being supplied from the back of the wafer. Bond pads provide for electrical control of the ejection mechanism.

In this manner large pagewidth printheads can be fabricated so as to provide for a drop on demand ink ejection mechanism.

One form of detailed manufacturing process which can be used to fabricate monolithic ink jet printheads operating in accordance with the principles taught by the present embodiment can proceed utilizing the following steps 

1. Using a double sided polished wafer complete a 0.5 micron one poly 2 metal CMOS process . This step is shown in . For clarity these diagrams may not be to scale and may not represent a cross section though any single plane of the nozzle. is a key to representations of various materials in these manufacturing diagrams and those of other cross referenced ink jet configurations.

2. Etch the CMOS oxide layers down to silicon or second level metal using Mask . This mask defines the nozzle cavity and the edge of the chips. This step is shown in .

3. Deposit a thin layer not shown of a hydrophilic polymer and treat the surface of this polymer for PTFE adherence.

5. Etch the PTFE and CMOS oxide layers to second level metal using Mask . This mask defines the contact vias for the heater electrodes. This step is shown in .

6. Deposit and pattern 0.5 microns of gold using a lift off process using Mask . This mask defines the heater pattern. This step is shown in .

8. Etch 1 micron of PTFE using Mask . This mask defines the nozzle rim and the rim at the edge of the nozzle chamber. This step is shown in .

9. Etch both layers of PTFE and the thin hydrophilic layer down to silicon using Mask . This mask defines a gap at inner edges of the actuators and the edge of the chips. It also forms the mask for a subsequent crystallographic etch. This step is shown in .

10. Crystallographically etch the exposed silicon using KOH. This etch stops on crystallographic planes forming an inverted square pyramid with sidewall angles of 54.74 degrees. This step is shown in .

11. Back etch through the silicon wafer with for example an ASE Advanced Silicon Etcher from Surface Technology Systems using Mask . This mask defines the ink inlets which are etched through the wafer. The wafer is also diced by this etch. This step is shown in .

12. Mount the printheads in their packaging which may be a molded plastic former incorporating ink channels which supply the appropriate color ink to the ink inlets at the back of the wafer.

13. Connect the printheads to their interconnect systems. For a low profile connection with minimum disruption of airflow TAB may be used. Wire bonding may also be used if the printer is to be operated with sufficient clearance to the paper.

The presently disclosed ink jet printing technology is potentially suited to a wide range of printing systems including color and monochrome office printers short run digital printers high speed digital printers offset press supplemental printers low cost scanning printers high speed pagewidth printers notebook computers with inbuilt pagewidth printers portable color and monochrome printers color and monochrome copiers color and monochrome facsimile machines combined printer facsimile and copying machines label printers large format plotters photograph copiers printers for digital photographic minilabs video printers PHOTO CD PHOTO CD is a registered trade mark of the Eastman Kodak Company printers portable printers for PDAs wallpaper printers indoor sign printers billboard printers fabric printers camera printers and fault tolerant commercial printer arrays.

It would be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that numerous variations and or modifications may be made to the present invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present embodiments are therefore to be considered in all respects to be illustrative and not restrictive.

The embodiments of the invention use an ink jet printer type device. Of course many different devices could be used. However presently popular ink jet printing technologies are unlikely to be suitable.

The most significant problem with thermal ink jet is power consumption. This is approximately 100 times that required for high speed and stems from the energy inefficient means of drop ejection. This involves the rapid boiling of water to produce a vapor bubble which expels the ink. Water has a very high heat capacity and must be superheated in thermal ink jet applications. This leads to an efficiency of around 0.02 from electricity input to drop momentum and increased surface area out.

The most significant problem with piezoelectric ink jet is size and cost. Piezoelectric crystals have a very small deflection at reasonable drive voltages and therefore require a large area for each nozzle. Also each piezoelectric actuator must be connected to its drive circuit on a separate substrate. This is not a significant problem at the current limit of around 300 nozzles per printhead but is a major impediment to the fabrication of pagewidth printheads with 19 200 nozzles.

Ideally the ink jet technologies used meet the stringent requirements of in camera digital color printing and other high quality high speed low cost printing applications. To meet the requirements of digital photography new ink jet technologies have been created. The target features include 

All of these features can be met or exceeded by the ink jet systems described below with differing levels of difficulty. Forty five different ink jet technologies have been developed by the Assignee to give a wide range of choices for high volume manufacture. These technologies form part of separate applications assigned to the present Assignee as set out in the table below under the heading Cross References to Related Applications.

The ink jet designs shown here are suitable for a wide range of digital printing systems from battery powered one time use digital cameras through to desktop and network printers and through to commercial printing systems.

For ease of manufacture using standard process equipment the printhead is designed to be a monolithic 0.5 micron CMOS chip with MEMS post processing. For color photographic applications the printhead is 100 mm long with a width which depends upon the ink jet type. The smallest printhead designed is IJ38 which is 0.35 mm wide giving a chip area of 35 square mm. The printheads each contain 19 200 nozzles plus data and control circuitry.

Ink is supplied to the back of the printhead by injection molded plastic ink channels. The molding requires 50 micron features which can be created using a lithographically micromachined insert in a standard injection molding tool. Ink flows through holes etched through the wafer to the nozzle chambers fabricated on the front surface of the wafer. The printhead is connected to the camera circuitry by tape automated bonding.

Eleven important characteristics of the fundamental operation of individual ink jet nozzles have been identified. These characteristics are largely orthogonal and so can be elucidated as an eleven dimensional matrix. Most of the eleven axes of this matrix include entries developed by the present assignee.

The complete eleven dimensional table represented by these axes contains 36.9 billion possible configurations of ink jet nozzle. While not all of the possible combinations result in a viable ink jet technology many million configurations are viable. It is clearly impractical to elucidate all of the possible configurations. Instead certain ink jet types have been investigated in detail. These are designated IJ01 to IJ45 above which matches the docket numbers in the table under the heading Cross References to Related Applications.

Other ink jet configurations can readily be derived from these forty five examples by substituting alternative configurations along one or more of the 11 axes. Most of the IJ01 to IJ45 examples can be made into ink jet printheads with characteristics superior to any currently available ink jet technology.

Where there are prior art examples known to the inventor one or more of these examples are listed in the examples column of the tables below. The IJ01 to IJ45 series are also listed in the examples column. In some cases print technology may be listed more than once in a table where it shares characteristics with more than one entry.

Suitable applications for the ink jet technologies include Home printers Office network printers Short run digital printers Commercial print systems Fabric printers Pocket printers Internet WWW printers Video printers Medical imaging Wide format printers Notebook PC printers Fax machines Industrial printing systems Photocopiers Photographic minilabs etc.

The information associated with the aforementioned 11 dimensional matrix are set out in the following tables.
