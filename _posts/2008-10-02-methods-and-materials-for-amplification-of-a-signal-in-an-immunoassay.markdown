This disclosure was made with Government support under contract no. DE FG02 05ER84326. The Government has certain rights in the present disclosure.

The present disclosure relates generally to ultrafine particles comprising a core region that comprises a signal amplifying molecule and a shell region that surrounds the core region and comprises at least one antibody affixed to its surface specific for at least one antigen or biomaterial. Alternatively the ultrafine particles may entrap the signal amplifying molecule within its matrix and may also have antibodies affixed to its surface for molecular recognition. The ultrafine particles of the present disclosure may be used in assays for the detection including quantification of at least one antigen present in a biological sample.

The enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA is a technique commonly used to detect disease markers in body fluids of humans and animals J. R. Crowther 1995 Elisa Theory and Practice Totowa N.J. Humana Press . Such disease markers generally referred to as antigens are identified via capture on a surface with the aid of a surface bound antibody that is highly selective toward molecular recognition and formation of a chemical complex with the said antigen followed by a quantitative chemical analysis sequence.

In an ELISA antigen that is captured by a specific antibody in the form of a surface bound complex may be detected and quantified by means of an analytical chemistry protocol see e.g. . For example a micro well plate array may be used with a primary antibody attached to the surface of the plate that selectively recognizes and attaches to the antigen . The signal amplification sequence may start by selectively attaching a secondary antibody which is said to be enzyme linked i.e. has an enzyme e.g. horseradish peroxidase attached to it and that recognizes the exposed portions of the antigen molecule that are left free after antigen attachment to the surface bound primary antibody. The enzyme may be a catalyst capable of converting substrates into detectable products e.g. colored products . Thus a solution containing an adequate substrate may be added to the micro wells having the surface bound polymolecular complex consisting of species through . After an incubation period the amount of captured antigen may be determined by quantifying the amount of converted substrate.

Despite the fact that enzymes for example horseradish peroxidase are capable of converting roughly 1 000 000 substrate molecules into their color signal emitting products per second there are at least two limitations in the current art. First the synthesis of the secondary antibody enzyme complex may be laborious costly or simply be impractical or impossible to carry out in certain cases. Second a secondary antibody enzyme complex only carries one signal amplifying molecule e.g. an enzyme per single surface captured antigen molecule. Furthermore chemical interferences can affect the biochemical reaction. As such the ratio of signal amplifying molecule to antigen e.g. the stoichiometric signal amplifying molecule antigen ratio is one and results in an intrinsic biochemical limit for signal amplification. It is thus desirable to devise an ELISA antigen detection system that does not rely on the biochemical synthesis of a secondary antibody enzyme complex.

In another embodiment the present disclosure provides immunoassay kits for detection of one or more antigens in a biological sample.

Additional features and advantages are described herein and will be apparent from the following Detailed Description and the figures.

Ultrafine particles are provided that comprise a matrix component wherein the matrix component includes a signal amplifying molecule embedded therein. The particles may also include at least one antibody specific for the antigen or biomaterial affixed to its surface. Alternatively the ultrafine particle may include a shell component that has one or more antibodies specific for one or more antigens of interest affixed and or embedded in its surface and a core component that carries a signal amplifying molecule. Surprisingly it has been discovered that these ultrafine particles are capable of making antibody enzyme ratios greater than one. The ultrafine particles can be used to indirectly bind a signal amplifying molecule to an antigen without compromising the ability of a secondary antibody to bind the surface bound primary antibody antigen complex. Notably these ultrafine particles may be used to amplify one or more signals produced in an immunoassay.

The present disclosure provides ultrafine particles useful for the detection of one or more antigens in a biological sample. The particles may contain a signal amplifying molecule embedded within the particle and may have at least one antibody affixed to its surface that is specific for at least one antigen. Alternatively the ultrafine particles may comprise a core region that comprises a signal amplifying molecule and a shell region that surrounds the core region and comprises at least one antibody affixed to its surface specific for one or more antigens. The particles may comprise any shape known including but not limited to substantially spheroidal substantially tubular substantially ellipsoidal or combinations thereof. However the skilled artisan will immediately appreciate that the particles may have any shape or may even be irregularly shaped. Further the particles may not be independent particles but may link to each other as beads in a continuous chain like structure. The particles may also form clusters of at least two particles linked together. Such ultrafine particles may be used to amplify one or more signals produced in an immunoassay.

In an embodiment referred to herein as Embodiment 1 the ultrafine particle has distinctive core and shell regions as illustrated in . The core may be a solution comprising an enzyme e.g. horseradish peroxidase or any other signal amplifying chemical molecule or combinations thereof. The shell has at least one secondary antibody embedded and or attached to its surface. Optionally the shell may contain magnetic nanoparticles embedded in its matrix. In the secondary antibody located at the shell of the ultrafine particle need not be in molecular proximity and or chemically attached to a signal amplifying molecule such as but not limited to horseradish peroxidase. The core shell ultrafine particle of Embodiment 1 may be designed for antigen capture and subsequent attachment to the surface bound primary antibody of an ELISA analysis sequence. The shell may be designed to release the core contents after contact with the solution containing the signal generating substrate. The core shell ultrafine particle may also be designed to have a stoichiometric ratio of core encapsulated signal amplifying molecule whether or not of enzymatic origin to shell embedded and or shell surface attached secondary antibody much larger than one unlike standard secondary antibody signal amplifying molecular complexes.

In another embodiment referred to herein as Embodiment 2 the ultrafine particles do not have distinctive core and shell regions. Rather the signal amplifying molecule whether or not of enzymatic origin are entrapped or matrix encapsulated within the major component of the particles. The particles may have at least one type of embedded and or surface attached secondary antibody and they may also be designed to have a stoichiometric ratio of matrix encapsulated signal amplifying molecule whether or not of enzymatic origin to embedded and or surface attached secondary antibody much larger than one unlike the standard secondary antibody signal amplifying molecular complexes in the conventional ELISA sequence shown in . Optionally the particles may contain magnetic nanoparticles quantum dots or combinations thereof embedded in their matrix. In Embodiment 2 the sequence of capture detection and quantification of antigen follows procedures similar to those described in . Furthermore just as in Embodiment 1 the amplifying molecule content may be released via ultrafine particle dissolution after contact with the solution having the substrate for electromagnetic radiation change. Since signal detection may not be limited to visual color changes the ultrafine particles may contain features which provide electromagnetic signaling such as but not limited to magnetic radioactive UV IR and ultrasound sensitive materials.

In yet another embodiment referred to herein as Embodiment 3 the ultrafine particles are designed in the form of core shell particles with the shell made porous and not necessarily dissolvable in the solution having the substrate for signal change generation. The shell may have at least one secondary antibody embedded and or attached to its surface for antigen capture and subsequent attachment of the ultrafine particle to the surface bound primary antibody anchored onto the concave up surface of the micro well see e.g. . Optionally the particles may contain magnetic nanoparticles quantum dots or combinations thereof. The porosity of the shell such as its average pore diameter is designed so as to allow passage of the signal generating molecule into the core of the particle where the signal amplifying molecule reside after contact with its solutions and also to allow for the resulting signal generating product or products to diffuse out of the particles. One requirement for such porous shell particles is that signal amplifying molecule such as but not limited to horseradish peroxidase be large enough to be unable to diffuse out of the ultrafine particles through the shell pores for shelf life and storage purposes. Therefore in Embodiment 3 and unlike Embodiments 1 and 2 there is no need for total or partial dissolution of the ultrafine particles to unleash the action of signal amplifying molecules onto signal generating molecules.

In another embodiment referred to herein as Embodiment 4 the ultrafine particles are designed not to have well defined core and shell regions. As in Embodiment 2 the signal amplifying molecule is matrix encapsulated within the ultrafine particle. In Embodiment 4 the matrix of the ultrafine particle may be made porous and insoluble in the liquids of the micro wells. The porosity of the matrix may be designed so as to permit transport of signal generating substrates and their products in and out of the ultrafine particles but not release of the signal amplifying molecule. The use of ultrafine particles in Embodiment 4 would be essentially the same as that of ultrafine particles in Embodiment 3.

Ultrafine particles may also be prepared as described above but without the signal amplifying molecule. Instead by way of nonlimiting example a core shell or matrix encapsulated signal emitting molecule may replace a signal amplifying molecule including for example horseradish peroxidase. On attachment of such ultrafine particle to the surface bound primary antibody antigen complex detection of a signal does not require addition of a signal generating substrate because the surface bound particles themselves would already yield a signal.

Ultrafine particles may be designed by any method known in the art. Such methods include but not limited to two fluid electrospray Larsen et al. 2003 125 1154 1155 emulsion polymerization Schork et al. 2005 175 129 255 emulsion evaporation Lorenceau et al. 2005 21 9183 9186 coacervation Calvo et al. 1997 63 125 132 and spray drying Tewa Tagne et al. 2007 30 124 135 .

The present disclosure provides assays for detecting an antigen in a biological sample. In an exemplary method a biological sample is contacted with one or more antigens with one or more ultrafine particles comprising a core region and a shell region wherein the core region comprises a signal amplifying molecule and the shell region that surrounds the core region comprises at least one secondary antibody affixed to its surface that is specific for the one or more antigens. The methods further include adding a signal generating molecule to the contacted sample that reacts with the one or more signal amplifying molecules to generate a signal and detecting the signal produced by the signal generating molecule reaction with the signal amplifying molecule.

The term detecting is used in the broadest sense to include both qualitative and quantitative measurements of a target molecule. In one aspect the detecting method as described herein is used to identify the mere presence of an antigen in a biological sample. In another aspect the method is used to test whether an antigen in a sample is at a detectable level. In yet another aspect the method can be used to quantify the amount of an antigen in a sample and further to compare the an antigen levels from different samples.

An ELISA sequence for capturing detecting and quantifying the desired antigen using an ultrafine particle is depicted in . The process starts by contacting the ultrafine particles with a fluid sample containing the antigen . Since the ultrafine particles have the secondary antibody at their surface as shown in a substantial fraction of the antigen in the fluid sample may be captured by the ultrafine particles. The ultrafine particle antigen adducts are then separated out of the fluid sample. As a nonlimiting example if the ultrafine particles are made magnetically responsive such as by loading them with magnetic nanoparticles a magnetic rod may be used to remove them from the fluid sample. Other ultrafine particle separation methods such as but not limited to centrifugation and filtration may be used. If for example the magnetic rod is sheathed with a glass rod the ultrafine particle antigen adducts may be released into the contents of micro wells having surface bound primary antibodies by rinsing the glass rod sheath with a liquid after the magnetic rod had been removed from it. Ultrafine particle antigen adducts collected via centrifugation or filtration can also be released into the contents of micro wells having surface bound primary antibodies. The surface bound primary antibodies capture the ultrafine particle antigen adducts in a fashion similar to conventional sandwich ELISA.

The signal amplification process starts by adding a solution of a signal generating molecule to the micro wells. If the signal amplifying molecule carried by the ultrafine particles is an enzyme oxidation catalyst such as horseradish peroxidase the signal generating molecule may be 3 3 5 5 tetramethylbenzidine. Other signal generating molecules may include chromogens or fluorogens such as but not limited to 2 2 Azinodi 3 Ethyl Benzthiazoline Sulfonic Acid ABST . To detect and amplify a signal the chemical action of the signal amplifying molecule upon the signal generating molecule needs to be unleashed. In Embodiment 1 the signal amplifying molecule is in the core of the ultrafine particle. If in this embodiment both ultrafine particle shell and solution of the signal generating molecule are formulated so as to effect dissolution of the shell during the so called incubation period the ultrafine particle core contents are released into the liquid volume of the micro wells. In this embodiment the amount of signal amplifying molecule in the core of the ultrafine particles is made as large as possible and as permitted by solubility of the said signal amplifying molecule in the core fluid and or by the ultrafine particle manufacturing parameters. Furthermore in this embodiment the stoichiometric ratio of signal amplifying molecule in the core of the ultrafine particles to secondary antibody contained in the shell of the ultrafine particles is made as much larger than unity as permitted by the ultrafine particle manufacturing method. Upon release of the signal amplifying molecule into the liquid in the micro wells the signal generation and amplification processes are initiated.

Examples of enzyme signal amplifying molecule substrate signal generating molecule combinations include for example i Horseradish peroxidase HRPO with hydrogen peroxidase as a substrate wherein the hydrogen peroxidase oxidizes a dye precursor e.g. orthophenylene diamine OPD or 3 3 5 5 tetramethyl benzidine hydrochloride TMB ii alkaline phosphatase AP with para nitrophenyl phosphate as chromogenic substrate and iii D galactosidase D Gal with a chromogenic substrate e.g. p nitrophenyl D galactosidase fluorogenic substrate 4 methylumbelliferyl p galactosidase or combinations thereof. Numerous other enzyme substrate combinations are available to those skilled in the art see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 275 149 and 4 318 980 . Other signal generating molecules may include chromogens or fluorogens such as but not limited to 2 2 Azinodi 3 Ethyl Benzthiazoline Sulfonic Acid ABST .

The solid phase used for immobilization may be any inert support or carrier that is essentially water insoluble and useful in immunometric assays including supports in the form of e.g. surfaces particles porous matrices etc. Examples of commonly used supports include small sheets Sephadex polyvinyl chloride plastic beads and assay plates or test tubes manufactured from polyethylene polypropylene polystyrene and the like including 96 well microtiter plates as well as particulate materials such as filter paper agarose cross linked dextran and other polysaccharides. Alternatively reactive water insoluble matrices such as cyanogen bromide activated carbohydrates and the reactive substrates described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 969 287 3 691 016 4 195 128 4 247 642 4 229 537 and 4 330 440 are suitably employed for capture reagent immobilization In a preferred embodiment the immobilized capture reagents are coated on a microtiter plate and in particular the preferred solid phase used is a multi well microtiter plate that can be used to analyze several samples at one time. The most preferred is a microtest 96 well ELISA plate such as that sold as Nune Maxisorb or Immulon.

The solid phase may be coated with the pre mixed capture reagents as defined above which may be linked by a non covalent or covalent interaction or physical linkage as desired techniques for attachment include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 376 110 and the references cited therein. If covalent the plate or other solid phase may be incubated with a cross linking agent together with the capture reagent under conditions well known in the art such as for one hour at room temperature.

Commonly used cross linking agents for attaching the pre mixed capture reagents to the solid phase substrate include e.g. 1 1 bis diazoacetyl 2 phenylethane glutaraldehyde N hydroxysuccinimide esters for example esters with 4 azidosalicylic acid homobifunctional imidoesters including disuccinimidyl esters such as 3 3 dithiobis succinimidylpropionate and bifunctional maleimides such as bis N maleimido 1 8 octane. Derivatizing agents such as methyl 3 p azidophenyl dithio propioimidate yield photoactivatable intermediates capable of forming cross links in the presence of light.

If plates are utilized e.g. 96 well plates they are coated with the mixture of capture reagents typically diluted in a buffer such as 0.05 M sodium carbonate by incubation for at least about 10 hours more preferably at least overnight at temperatures of about 4 20 C. more preferably about 4 8 C. and at a pH of about 8 12 more preferably about 9 10 and most preferably about 9.6. If shorter coating times 1 2 hours are desired one can use 96 well plates with nitrocellulose filter bottoms Millipore MULTISCREEN or coat at 37 C. The plates may be stacked and coated long in advance of the assay itself and then the assay can be carried out simultaneously on several samples in a manual semi automatic or automatic fashion such as by using robotics.

The coated plates may then be treated with a blocking agent that binds non specifically to and saturates the binding sites to prevent unwanted binding of the free ligand to the excess sites on the wells of the plate. Examples of appropriate blocking agents for this purpose include e.g. gelatin bovine serum albumin egg albumin casein and non fat milk. The blocking treatment typically takes place under conditions of ambient temperatures for about 1 4 hours preferably about 1.5 to 3 hours.

A biological sample to be analyzed may be diluted at about 5 15 preferably about 10 by volume. Buffers that may be used for dilution for this purpose include a PBS containing 0.5 BSA 0.05 TWEEN 20 detergent P20 0.05 PROCLIN 300 antibiotic 5 mM EDTA 0.25 Chaps surfactant 0.2 beta gamma globulin and 0.35M NaCl b PBS containing 0.5 BSA 0.05 P20 and 0.05 PROCLIN 300 pH 7 c PBS containing 0.5 BSA 0.05 P20 0.05 PROCLIN 300 5 mM EDTA and 0.35 M NaCl pH 6.35 d PBS containing 0.5 BSA 0.05 P20 0.05 PROCLIN 300 5 mM EDTA 0.2 beta gamma globulin and 0.35 M NaCl and e PBS containing 0.5 BSA 0.05 P20 0.05 PROCLIN 300 5 mM EDTA 0.25 Chaps and 0.35 M NaCl Buffer.

The conditions for incubation of one or more antigens and one or more antibodies specific for the antigens are selected to maximize sensitivity of the assay and to minimize dissociation. The incubation may be accomplished at fairly constant temperatures ranging from about 0 C. to about 40 C. preferably from about 36 to 38 C. to obtain a less variable lower coefficient of variant CV than at e.g. room temperature. The time for incubation depends primarily on the temperature being generally no greater than about 10 hours to avoid an insensitive assay. The incubation time may be from about 0.5 to 3 hours and more preferably 1.5 3 hours at 36 38 C. to maximize binding of to capture reagents. The duration of incubation may be longer if a protease inhibitor is added to prevent proteases in the biological fluid from degrading the one or more antigens of interest.

Examples of suitable signal amplifying molecules include for example moieties that may be detected directly such as fluorochrome chemiluminscent and radioactive labels as well as moieties such as enzymes that must be reacted or derivatized to be detected. Examples of such labels include the radioisotopes P C I H and I fluorophores such as rare earth chelates or fluorescein and its derivatives rhodamine and its derivatives dansyl umbelliferone luceriferases e.g. firefly luciferase and bacterial luciferase U.S. Pat. No. 4 737 456 luciferin 2 3 dihydrophthalazinediones horseradish peroxidase HRP alkaline phosphiatase galactosidase glucoamylase lysozyme saccharide oxidases e.g. glucose oxidase galactose oxidase and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase heterocyclic oxidases such as uricase and xanthine oxidase coupled with an enzyme that employs hydrogen peroxide to oxidize a dye precursor such as HPP lactoperoxidase or microperoxidase biotin avidin biotin streptavidin biotin Streptavidin galactosidase with MUG spin labels bacteriophage labels stable free radicals and the like.

The amount of one or more antigens of interest may be determined by removing excess unbound nanoparticles through washing and then measuring the amount of the label using a detection method appropriate to the label and correlating the measured amount with the amount of one or more antigens of interest in the biological sample. For example in the case of enzymes the amount of color developed and measured will be a direct measurement of the amount of one or more antigens of interest present. Specifically if HRP is the label the color is detected using the substrate OPD at 490 nm absorbance.

Immunoassays may be used for screening a subject for a disease or disorder characterized by the expression of an antigen. The method may include obtaining a biological sample from the subject and contacting the biological sample with one or more ultrafine particles. The particles may contain a signal amplifying molecule embedded within the particle and may have at least one antibody affixed to its surface that is specific for at least one antigen. Alternatively the particles may include a core region and a shell region. The core region includes a signal amplifying molecule and the shell region that surrounds the core region includes at least one secondary antibody affixed to its surface that is specific for the one or more antigens. The methods may further include adding a signal generating molecule to the contacted biological sample that reacts with the signal amplifying molecule to generate a signal and detecting the signal produced by the signal generating molecule reaction with the signal amplifying molecule. The detection is performed on a subject having the disease or disorder at the time the antigen is detected. Such diseases or disorders may include cancer.

Articles of manufacture including for example kits are provided by the present disclosure. The articles of manufacture may include a container and a label or package insert on or associated with the container. Suitable containers include for example bottles vials or syringes.

The label or package insert may include directions for performing an immunoassay.

The kit may further include a solid support for the capture reagents which may be provided as a separate element or on which an antibody specific for one or more antigens of interest are immobilized.

The components of the kit will be provided in predetermined ratios with the relative amounts of the various reagents suitably varied to provide for concentrations in solution of the reagents that substantially maximize the sensitivity of the assay. Particularly the reagents may be provided as dry powders usually lyophilized including excipients which on dissolution will provide for a reagent solution having the appropriate concentration for combining with the sample to be tested.

Without further description it is believed that one of ordinary skill in the art may using the preceding description and the following illustrative examples make and utilize the agents of the present disclosure and practice the claimed methods. The following working examples are provided to facilitate the practice of the present disclosure and are not to be construed as limiting in any way the remainder of the disclosure.

This example demonstrates the encapsulation of a signal amplifying molecule in a biopolymeric core shell capsule functionalized with antibodies using electrohydrodynamic forces.

In an exemplary method encapsulation of horseradish peroxidase HRP in a capsule is designed following the teachings of Embodiment 1. The core fluid solution may be prepared by dissolving HRP in buffer solutions such as PBS buffer for example 10 mM pH 7.4. The shell solution may be prepared by dissolving poly lactide co glycolide or PLGA with a molecular weight between 10 kDa and 500 kDa in ethyl acetate. The lactide content in PLGA ranges between 0.1 and 99 wt . A pegylated secondary antibody dissolved in a mixture of ethyl acetate and dimethyl sulfoxide with a volume ratio 1 1 is added to the PLGA solution. The weight percent content of PLGA in the shell solution may be between 0.01 to 10 wt . By way of nonlimiting example the pegylated secondary antibody can be from an antibody of CA 125 or from a cluster of differentiation such as but not limited to CD 19 and or CD 20. It is thus understood that the term secondary antibody applies to CA 125 CD 19 CD 20 and to any other antibody whether or not of proteinaceous origin.

Core shell capsules with an average diameter between 0.050 m and 50 m may be madeby two fluid electrospray. In one example of two fluid electrospray the core and shell fluids are made to pass through an inner tube and an outer tube respectively and arranged coaxially.

Characteristic internal diameters of the outer and inner tubes are in the range of 0.1 to 3.0 millimeters. Representative separation between the two tube assembly and the collector surface are 1 to 100 cm. To make core shell capsules in the 0.050 50 m range using the core and shell solutions described above in this Example applied voltages in the 1 to 20 kV range are also necessary and fluid flow rates for the core and shell liquids between 0.005 0.50 mL h and 0.03 3.0 mL h respectively are also necessary. Core shell capsules with a HRP loading between 0.01 and 20 by weight of the added polymer may be made by the method described above in this Example by adjusting the concentration of the core fluid solution. Capsules with a secondary antibody loading between 5 and 100 g per mg of the added polymer may be made by adjusting the concentration of the shell fluid solution.

A solution containing rhodamine 6G dissolved in ethanol may be added to the PLGA solution to afford a final concentration of the chromophore between 0.1 and 100 mg mL. A pegylated secondary antibody dissolved in a mixture of ethyl acetate and dimethyl sulfoxide with a volume ratio 1 1 is added to the PLGA solution. Particles with a secondary antibody loading between 5 and 100 g per mg of the added polymer may be made adjusting its concentration in solution. Particles with an average diameter between 0.050 m and 50 m may be made by adjusting process variables as known in the art such as single fluid electrospray. Single fluid electrospray is based on a single tube rather than two. Characteristic internal diameter of the single electrospray tube may be in the range of 0.1 to 3.0 millimeters. Representative separation between the tube and the collector surface may be 1 to 100 cm. To make particles in the 0.050 50 m range using the solution described above applied voltages in the 1 to 20 kV range are also necessary and fluid flow rate of the solution between 0.003 3.0 mL h is also necessary.

This aqueous solution may be added to the solution prepared above in this Example under constant mixing and emulsified via sonication for 1 hour. The emulsion is then poured in an aqueous solution of poly vinyl alcohol between 1 and 10 wt with a molecular weight between 5 kDa and 60 kDa under constant mixing and it is emulsified via sonication for 1 hour.
