title: Same frequency satellite terrestrial radio broadcast
abstract: A satellite broadcasts radio programs to mobile and fixed receivers at various locations. Ground stations supplement the satellite broadcasts in areas where the satellite signal may be shadowed. Likewise, the satellite signal supplements the terrestrial transmissions in areas with marginal terrestrial signal strength. Ground stations and a satellite transmit the same digital symbol stream over a same frequency spectrum. The symbol streams arrive in each service area of the ground stations with a relative delay that is within a window for which a receiver is adapted to decode efficiently. Spectral efficiency is achieved by allowing the ground stations to share the same frequencies as the satellites.

This application claims the priority and benefit of U.S. provisional patent application 60 924 672 entitled SAME FREQUENCY SATELLITE TERRESTRIAL RADIO BROADCAST filed May 25 2007 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The technology is related to providing satellite terrestrial spatial diversity transmissions on a same frequency by using timing and synchronization arrangements.

Two satellite terrestrial radio systems currently serve the USA Sirius Radio Sirius and XM Radio XM . Each is allocated a 12.5 MHz frequency spectrum by the Federal Communications Commission FCC as illustrated in . Sirius divides its spectrum into three equal portions each of which is slightly less than 4.2 MHz. Two portions are allocated to two satellites and one portion is allocated to terrestrial ground based repeaters. XM divides its spectrum into three portions as well but allocates a greater portion to the terrestrial repeaters as compared to the satellites.

In both Sirius and XM fixed or mobile receivers receive the desired program by three paths two satellite paths and one ground path by using receivers capable of tuning to multiple respective frequencies and connected in a diversity configuration. A reception of any one signal alone guarantees reception of the desired program. Division of the spectrum between the three paths reduces the amount of programming that can be transmitted since the same program must be carried by three frequency signals two satellite and one terrestrial to guarantee reception via a reception of a single signal. This also increases the complexity of the receivers since they must be able to tune to multiple frequency signals in search of a program. The increase in complexity also increases the price of the receivers.

To increase broadcast capacity using multiple transmitters it is desirable to use the entirety of the available spectrum instead of dividing the spectrum into multiple portions and repeating the broadcast program information in each portion. In one or more non limiting example embodiments that maximizes the transmission capacity a digital wireless broadcast system includes a plurality of ground stations and a satellite.

Each ground station wirelessly transmits to a corresponding service area a digital symbol stream over a frequency spectrum. The satellite also wirelessly transmits the same digital symbol stream over the same frequency spectrum to the plurality of service areas. Within each service area the digital symbol stream from the corresponding ground station and from the satellite arrive within a predetermined time period of each other. The predetermined time period is a relative delay between the digital symbol stream from the satellite and from the ground station that is within a range for which the receiver is capable of decoding the digital symbol stream. The relative delay may be measured in symbol periods. It is preferred that a timing of transmission from one ground station be independently controllable from a timing of transmission from another ground station.

It is preferred that the digital symbol stream from the ground station be timed nominally to arrive in advance of the digital symbol stream from the satellite within the service area. To accomplish this programming information related to the symbol stream should be available to the plurality of ground stations prior to the satellite transmitting the symbol stream to the service areas. In a non limiting example embodiment the corresponding programming information is provided to the ground stations from the satellite over a different frequency spectrum or is available from a source other than the satellite.

A ground station can transmit the digital symbol stream omnidirectionally in azimuth. Another ground station can transmit the stream in a shaped pattern so as to have varied shapes for the service area. The service area is preferred to be shaped asymmetrically elongated in a direction away from the satellite. Non limiting example shapes include an elongated hexagon a compressed hexagon and a rectangle. The service area can be divided into a plurality of sectors. It is preferred that the ground station be such that a timing of the digital symbol stream transmitted to one sector is independently controllable relative to a timing of the digital symbol stream transmitted to another sector. The sizes and or shapes of the sectors closer to the satellite can be different from the sectors further from the satellite within the service area. At borders between services areas the digital symbols from the respective ground stations are timed to arrive within a small specified number of modulation periods of each other.

In a non limiting example embodiment another second satellite transmits the digital symbol stream to the service areas using another second frequency spectrum. It is preferred that the ground station also be able to transmit the digital symbol stream using the same second frequency spectrum in addition to the using the first frequency spectrum. The ground station can be the same ground station mentioned in connection with the first satellite or can be a different ground station thus providing both ground station and satellite diversity. The digital symbol stream over the second frequency spectrum from the ground station and the second satellite arrive to the receiver in the service area within the predetermined time period of each other.

Another non limiting example embodiment of a digital wireless broadcast system includes first and second satellites and both satellites transmit a digital symbol stream over a frequency spectrum to a service area. The digital symbol stream from the first and second satellites arrive to a receiver in the service area within a predetermined time period of each other. Where there are multiple service areas the first and second satellites can transmit the digital symbol stream to each area using a frequency spectrum or time slot corresponding to the service area in order to reduce the size of the service area and thus the maximum delay differential that the receiver must handle. Alternatively the first and second satellites can be used to transmit the digital symbol stream to each area using different directed beams different time slots and or different polarizations corresponding to each service area.

A non limiting example of a digital wireless broadcast method is disclosed. The method includes transmitting a digital symbol stream using both a plurality of ground stations and a satellite over a same frequency spectrum. The digital symbol stream from each ground station is synchronized to arrive within a predetermined time period of the satellite signal received in a corresponding service area. The predetermined time period is a relative delay between the digital symbol stream from the satellite and from the ground station that is within a range for which the receiver is capable of decoding the digital symbol stream. The relative delay may be measured in symbol periods.

It is preferred that the digital symbol stream from the ground station be timed nominally to arrive in advance of the digital symbol stream from the satellite within the service area. The method can also includes providing programming information corresponding to the digital symbol stream to the ground station from the satellite over a different frequency spectrum or from a source other than the satellite.

The digital symbol stream from a ground station can be transmitted omnidirectionally in azimuth or in a shaped pattern so as to have varied shapes for the service area. A service area can be shaped to be asymmetrical elongated in a direction away from the satellite. Also the service area can be divided into a plurality of sectors. The digital symbol stream transmitted to at least one sector can be independently controlled relative to a timing of the digital symbol stream transmitted to another sector of the service area. The sizes and or shapes of the sectors closer to the satellite can be different from the sectors further from the satellite within the service area. At borders between services areas the digital symbols from the respective ground stations are timed to arrive within one modulation period of each other.

In another non limiting example method the digital symbol stream can be transmitted using a second satellite over a second frequency spectrum. The same second frequency spectrum can also be used by a ground station to transmit the digital symbol stream. The ground station can be the same ground station as mentioned to be operating in the first frequency spectrum in connection with the first satellite or can be a different ground station The digital symbol stream over the second frequency spectrum from the ground station and the second satellite arrive to the receiver in the service within the predetermined time period of each other.

Another non limiting example of a digital wireless broadcast method includes transmitting the digital symbol stream from first and second satellites over a same frequency spectrum to a service area. The digital symbol stream from the first and second satellites arrive to a receiver in the service area within the predetermined time period of each other. Where there are multiple service areas the first and second satellites are used to transmit the digital symbol stream to each area using a frequency spectrum or time slot corresponding to the service area. Alternatively the first and second satellites are used to transmit the digital symbol stream to each area using different directed beams different time slots and or different polarizations corresponding to each service area.

In the following description for purposes of explanation and not limitation specific details are set forth such as particular architectures interfaces techniques and so on to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced in other embodiments that depart from these specific details. That is those skilled in the art will be able to devise various arrangements which although not explicitly described or shown herein embody the principles of the invention and are included within its spirit and scope.

In some instances detailed descriptions of well known devices circuits and methods are omitted so as not to obscure the description of the present invention with unnecessary detail. All statements herein reciting principles aspects and embodiments of the invention as well as specific examples thereof are intended to encompass both structural and functional equivalents thereof. Additionally it is intended that such equivalents include both currently known equivalents as well as equivalents developed in the future i.e. any elements developed that perform the same function regardless of structure.

Thus for example it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that block diagrams herein can represent conceptual views of illustrative circuitry embodying the principles of the technology. Similarly it will be appreciated that any flow charts state transition diagrams pseudocode and the like represent various processes which may be substantially represented in computer readable medium and so executed by a computer or processor whether or not such computer or processor is explicitly shown.

The functions of the various elements including functional blocks labeled or described as processors or controllers may be provided through the use of dedicated hardware as well as hardware capable of executing software in association with appropriate software.

Moreover explicit use of the term Processor or controller should not be construed to refer exclusively to hardware capable of executing software and may include without limitation digital signal processor DSP hardware read only memory ROM for storing software random access memory RAM and non volatile storage.

In this scenario spatial diversity can be used to decode the digital symbol stream. The amount of relative delay which can be measured in symbol periods between the satellite and terrestrial signals should be within a tolerance range of the receiver for an efficient decoding to take place. For example the relative delay would preferably be within a number of symbols delay spread for which an equalizer using Maximum Likelihood Sequence Estimation MLSE can be adapted e.g. in the region of 5 symbol periods. This will be further explained below.

For simplicity of explanation the system in includes a single satellite and a single ground station . However systems with multiple satellites and or multiple ground stations with corresponding multiple services areas are contemplated. Also contemplated are systems with multiple receivers within the system as a whole and also within any particular service areas.

The satellite is assumed to be geostationary. As such the length of the line segment KL which can represent a diameter of the service area is assumed to be much smaller than the height of the satellite . Then can be taken as the angle of elevation of the satellite as seen from anywhere within the service area without sacrificing much accuracy. Point O defines a location directly under the ground station .

For the purposes of this disclosure points left are assumed to be closer to the satellite relative to points right . Then point K is nearer to the satellite than point O by an amount substantially equal to r cos where r is a radius of the service area . Point L is further from the satellite than point O by an amount also substantially equal to r cos . Also for the purposes of this disclosure points above and below describe points i.e. locations within a service area that lie on one side or the other of the azimuthal line defined by the satellite and the ground station. In the service area is divided to portions above and below by the line segment KOL.

If the ground station transmits the same terrestrial signal around all degrees of azimuth i.e. transmits omnidirectionally the relative time delay between the satellite and terrestrial signals will be different at different points within the service area with extremes occurring at points K and L. The ground station can be controlled to time the terrestrial signal transmission such that the terrestrial signal is synchronized with the satellite signal for receivers at point O i.e. the relative delay of the digital symbol streams from the ground station and from the satellite is substantially zero at point O. When this occurs the satellite signal will be advanced relative to the terrestrial signal at point K by an amount

To make the relative timing differences between the satellite and terrestrial signals at points K and L same in magnitude and substantially equal to

To provide the timing advance the ground station can receive programming information for transmission to the receivers from a programming source other than the satellite as illustrated in . Examples include receiving the programming information from the source over a microwave link a terrestrial cable a fiber etc. In another embodiment the ground station can receive the programming information carried over a separate channel different frequency spectrum from the satellite in advance of the satellite transmitting the symbol stream intended for the receivers .

In digital communication systems equalizers can be used to process multiple copies of a same symbol stream delayed relative to each other received at a receiver. In the realm of cell phones the signal copies can arise through echoes or reflections from large objects or by deliberately transmitting the signal from multiple sites. To achieve a diversity benefit a small time shift of the signals is more advantageous than signals that are perfectly synchronized at the receiver.

In the context of a satellite terrestrial broadcast system the equalizer in the receiver is preferred to function with the greatest timing difference encountered over the service area namely

A typical equalizer of reasonable complexity as used in cell phones conforming to the Global System for Mobile communications GSM standard has the capability to handle signals with relative delays up to 5 modulation symbols. In GSM the modulation symbols are of 3.69 uS duration so a 5 symbol delay is 18.46 uS or 5538 meters at the speed of light c.

If the terrestrial signal is advanced by 5 symbol periods relative to the satellite signal at the ground station point O then at some distance to the left on the order of 5 Km the ground signal will be delayed by 5 symbol periods relative to the satellite signal but still with a relative delay within the 5 symbol periods to which the equalizer can adapt. This will also occur a some point a much greater distance to the right of point O. Thus the radius of the service area can be of the order of 5 Km towards the satellite and greater away from the satellite resulting in a service area adequate for many coverage situations such as an urban area.

It is also desired that on the edge of service areas of two ground stations each ground station synchronized similarly to the satellite signal at respective sites the receiver should receive signals from both ground stations within the same equalizer delay spread and as explained further below may be assisted by using a different ground station timing advance for signals broadcast in the direction away from the satellite as compared to signals broadcast in directions toward the satellite.

In a non limiting example embodiment individual programs music talk etc. are transmitted each on its own frequency channel carrier . Each carrier may be transmitted both from the satellite and from the ground station . Preferably the terrestrial signal is time advanced relative to the satellite signal as it would be received at point O in . This minimizes the relative delay between the satellite and terrestrial signals as experienced by receivers at the edge of the service area .

At the left edge of the service area point K the terrestrial signal is advanced relative to the satellite signal by an amount

Note that the rate of differential delay decays at a smaller rate to the right of the ground station in the direction away from the satellite than to the left. If the service area is limited only by the differential delay it can be seen that the differential delay is asymmetrical extending much further to the right away from the satellite than to the left toward the satellite relative to the ground station .

In a non limiting embodiment this asymmetrical phenomena is exploited by providing a ground station service area a cell that is asymmetrical with terrestrial signals having more energy in the direction away from the satellite and less energy in the direction towards the satellite. This is illustrated in which illustrate side and top views respectively of a service area . The service area is elongated to the right relative to the ground station . More energy in the direction away from the satellite provides a longer useful range. This can be accomplished by the ground station beaming the terrestrial signal in a shaped pattern which can be accomplished using one or more antennas.

In a non limiting alternative the service area of the ground station can be divided into sectors. illustrates a geometry of an example service area divided into first second and third sectors and as viewed from above. The service area can be accomplished with a ground station located at point O having three antennas for example with each antenna covering a nominal beam width of substantially 120 degrees and covering substantially a 120 degree sector of azimuth. Any number of sectors or antennas are contemplated.

Sectors can be represented as having a hexagonal shape as illustrated in . Taking the first sector as an example the distance from the ground station from point O to the furthest vertex F of the hexagon is twice the distance to the nearer vertices A and H. The sector antenna pattern only need radiate approximately 1 16of the energy towards the nearer vertices A and H which lie at 60 degrees relative to a center of the sector as compared with the sector center toward F due to the 4power of distance terrestrial propagation law. Accordingly the antenna patterns can be tailored to be nominally 12 dB down at 60 degrees and their 3 dB beam widths can be on the order of 30 degrees.

The radiated terrestrial signal can be different for each sector. For example the terrestrial signal transmitted to the first sector can be independent of the terrestrial signal transmitted to the second or the third sector or both. The terrestrial signals can vary in timing or strength or both.

Referring back to moving towards the satellite from the ground station the satellite signal becomes time advanced while the terrestrial signal becomes delayed. Moving away the satellite from the ground station both the satellite and terrestrial signals become time delayed. As a result the relative differential delay between the satellite and terrestrial signals declines at a faster rate when moving towards the satellite to the left than when moving away from the satellite to the right from the ground station at point O.

At certain points negative differential timing values below the center line in occur. This indicates that the satellite signal is actually time advanced relative to the terrestrial signal at certain locations within the service area . With the three sector geometry illustrated in this happens at vertices E and E corresponding to curve E in and at vertices F and F corresponding to curve F in . This indicates that along line segments defined by points O E and O F in the first sector and points O E and O F in the second sector some portion of the line segments are such that the terrestrial signal is delayed relative to the satellite signal. Since the line segments are within the service area served by the ground station then there are some locations within the service area in which the terrestrial signal is delayed relative to the satellite signal.

At all other vertices the terrestrial signal is received in advance or substantially at the same time relative to the satellite signal such as at vertices H and H D and D and B corresponding to curves H D and B respectively in .

Further complicating the situation is that the terrestrial signal propagation can be characterized by multi path reflections where echoes of the signal are received over a longer than the line of sight path. If the satellite signal is time advanced relative to the line of sight path the total delay spread from earliest ray to latest ray would be greater than the terrestrial delay spread which can be undesirable

To lessen the likelihood of the total delay spread exceeding the terrestrial delay spread it is preferred that the satellite signal not be advanced relative to the terrestrial signal i.e. the differential should be brought within the positive differential timing region above the centerline in . That is the symbol stream from the ground station is preferred to nominally arrive ahead of or at least not behind the symbol stream from the satellite in the service area. One way to achieve this is to increase the amount of timing advance of the ground station signal to bring vertices E E F and F into the positive differential timing region by advancing the timing by an amount greater than

Another way avoid the potentially undesirable situation is to use alternative cell geometries so that points vertices E E F and F are moved in a direction further away from the satellite to the right . The result is that in general the portions of the cell to the left of the ground station is shortened as compared to the portions to the right. Of course combinations of adjusting both timing advances and cell geometries are contemplated.

The cell borders cells through where each cell is served by a respective ground station . The shapes of cells are all similar but this is not a requirement. Embodiments in which the cell shapes and or sizes are different are contemplated. Within each cell the digital symbol streams transmitted from the ground station and the satellite arrive within the predetermined time period i.e. the receiver s tolerance range of each other. This can be accomplished by independently controlling the transmission times of some or all ground stations.

In the cell it is assumed that the corresponding ground station serving the cell is located at point where the three sectors meet. That is the geometry of the cell is elongated along the azimuthal line defined by points A and B. As seen the sectors of the cell lying in a direction away from the satellite relative to the ground station relative to point O are of different sizes and or shapes from the sectors of the cell lying in a direction toward the satellite. Taking the cell as an example the third sector is a different shape and size from the first and second sectors and . In general the sectors lying to the right i.e. right firing of the ground station can be longer and occupy a larger portion of the service area when compared to the sectors lying to the left i.e. left firing of the ground station.

While not strictly necessary the center of the cell can lie along a line on the azimuth defined by the satellite and the ground station. For example in the center of the cell lies somewhere on the line segment defined by points O and B within the sector .

The sector of the cell is a parallelogram e.g. a rhombus defined by vertices A F H and O. The sector is also a parallelogram defined by vertices A F H and O. The sector is a hexagon defined by vertices H D B D and O. The sides of the hexagon of the sector need not all be of equal length.

In the points O which are commensurate with locations of the ground stations serve as a vertex for each of the sectors. The sector covers a larger portion of the service area than either sector or and can cover a larger portion than a combination of the two sectors.

In points E F E and F in the sectors and are now located to the right of point A. Compare with . Then if the terrestrial signal received at point A is advanced relative to the satellite signal then it is guaranteed that the terrestrial signal will be advanced relative to the satellite signal at all points within sectors and . This is illustrated in which clearly indicates that the curves E corresponding to points E and B in and F corresponding to vertices F and F both never fall below curve A corresponding to the vertex A .

In the cell geometry illustrated in the timing advance for sectors and can be substantially the same or even identical. In an example non limiting embodiment the sectors and can be merged into a single 240 degree sector using an appropriate antenna pattern. This can reduce the complexity and cost of the ground station serving the cell by reducing the number of transmitters and antenna sets from three to two. As mentioned above the timing advance of the terrestrial signal transmitted to the sector can be different from that of the sectors and as illustrated in . See curves H D and B as compared to curves A F F and G.

Other modified cell shapes and patterns can be used. For example illustrates a non limiting example of a pattern of cells each served by ground stations where the right firing hexagonal sectors are elongated to the right while the left firing hexagonal sectors are compressed. illustrates yet another non limiting alternative using rectangular sectors each served by ground stations that are of different lengths to the right and to the left of the ground stations respectively.

In addition to the illustrated non limiting examples any geometry that is generally elongated in the direction away from the satellite and compressed in the direction toward the satellite relative to the ground station is contemplated. In addition the shapes of the cells the service areas need not be identical. It is contemplated that the sizes and or the shapes of the cells can be different.

One of many advantages of maintaining separate right and left firing sectors is that the transmit timing can be chosen independently for each sector so as to achieve optimum terrestrial and satellite signal timing alignments for multiple diversity. For example shows that the timing advance of the right firing sector can be reduced so that points H D and B experience substantially zero timing differential between the terrestrial and the satellite signal.

Moreover at vertex A in the timing of the terrestrials signals received from the left firing sectors and from the ground station can be made approximately the same as timing of the terrestrial signals received from the right firing sectors of ground stations and when an account is taken of the difference in timing advance of those ground stations to align them with the satellite timing at their locations in a like manner. As a result vertex A can receive triple diversity terrestrial signals as well as the satellite signal. Similarly vertex B can also receive triple diversity terrestrial signals from ground stations and . In fact any or all vertices A F D B D and F can receive multiple diversity terrestrial signals.

To make such diversity as effective as possible the timing advance of ground stations such as and which would normally be the same can be offset slightly so that a border point such as F receives the two terrestrial signals with a small symbol timing difference. For example if the offset is 0.5 modulation symbol periods then there would be one symbol timing difference at the border point.

Such a deliberate timing difference is desirable when an equalizer is used to demodulate a multi path signal. One type of equalizer which provides this desirable characteristic is the Viterbi Maximum Likelihood Sequence Estimator MLSE . There are many other types of equalizers known and there are also many published refinements to the MLSE equalizer which may be advantageously employed.

It is also desirable to provide diversity satellite signals for receivers that are out of range of any ground station. In an example non limiting embodiment as illustrated in the service area is out of range of any ground stations. In this case first and second satellites and can provide the same digital symbol stream using respective parts of the frequency spectrum to avoid the need for accurate timing synchronization as in the case of XM and Sirius satellite systems.

However in an alternative non limiting embodiment the first and second satellites can transmit using the same frequency spectrum to any receiver within the service area . The service area is preferred to be small enough such that the amount of relative delay measured in symbol periods between the digital symbol stream from the satellites and within the service area is within a tolerance range of the receiver for an efficient decoding to take place.

It is difficult to synchronize the transmissions of two satellites so that their signals are received with a small relative timing difference over an entire continent. To overcome this difficulty the satellite spectrum can be divided into multiple portions to provide two satellite diversity. This is illustrated in which includes two satellites and and two service areas and . The frequency spectrum is divided into portions and i.e. into carriers and and both carriers are transmitted by both satellites. The timings of digital symbol transmissions using carrier of the spectrum can be independently controlled relative to the timing using carrier for one or both satellites. It is also possible to divide a transmission period into timeslots instead of dividing a frequency spectrum and to adjust the relative timing of the modulations from each satellite on a timeslot by timeslot basis allocating each timeslot to the respective service area.

Yet another non limiting alternative is to transmit from each satellite in the same frequency spectrum over the entire continent but using different polarizations for example Right Hand Circular and Left Hand Circular polarization. Despite a 6 mS relative timing difference that can arise at extremely different locations over a continent such as Miami versus Seattle or San Diego versus New York a dual polarization diversity receiver used with a diversity equalizer can resolve the transmitted information. Any number of satellites and any number of service areas are also contemplated.

Multiple frequencies can also be used on the ground stations to provide frequency diversity transmissions as well as terrestrial satellite spatial diversity for each satellite signal as already described above. This is illustrated in that illustrates a non limiting example digital wireless broadcast system with multiple satellites serving a service area with a ground station. The system includes first and second satellites and providing respective satellite signals to the service area . The first satellite provides a digital symbol stream over a first frequency spectrum spectrum and the second satellite provides the same digital symbol stream over a second frequency spectrum spectrum where the first and second spectrums are different.

The ground station can transmit two terrestrial signals as well. The first terrestrial signal is carried over the same frequency spectrum as the first satellite spectrum and the second terrestrial signal is carried over the same frequency spectrum as the second satellite spectrum . Thus the spectral utilization of the above disclosed scheme can be improved by a factor 1.5 compared to the existing satellite radio systems.

It is also possible to split ground station into two stations and which transmit using first and second spectrum respectively as illustrated in . The terrestrial signal transmitted in the first spectrum has its timing related to the satellite transmission received in the first spectrum in its service area. Similarly the terrestrial signal transmitted in the second spectrum has a timing related to the satellite transmission received in the second spectrum its respective coverage area.

The differential delay between signals received from a west coast satellite and an east coast satellite can be as much as 6 mS which is over 1600 symbols at the GSM symbol rate. A scheme published by Alamouti can be used to provide diversity transmissions with large delay difference between them. When each transmission is also subject to multi path propagation an extension of the Alamouti scheme to multi path channels can be used. This was published by Erik Lindskog and Arogyaswami Paulraj in A transmit Diversity Scheme for Channels with Intersymbol Interference 0 7803 6286 1 00 2000 IEEE pp 307 311 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.

To cope with 6 mS timing difference a block of known symbols 6 mS long is used with the Alamouti or Lindskog Pauljaj scheme. For the block of known symbols which may be used for channel estimation to represent an overhead of less than 10 the block of data symbols lying between blocks of known sync symbols should be of the order of 60 mS long. It is preferred that the channel remains constant over such block periods.

For mobile receivers the channel is unlikely to be constant over such long block periods. For frequencies in S band and vehicle speeds of 60 mph the block length is preferably less than 0.5 mS. In an example non. limiting embodiment the delay difference between two satellites is reduced by dividing the continent into smaller regions using multiple satellite beams. This is exemplified in which illustrates a non limiting example digital wireless broadcast system with a satellite providing satellite signals to two service areas and . A first satellite signal to the first service area is provided via a first beam beam and a second satellite signal to the second service area is provided via a second beam beam . The first and second satellite beam signals may or may not use the same frequency spectrum. Further the timings of the first and second beam signals may be independent of each other.
