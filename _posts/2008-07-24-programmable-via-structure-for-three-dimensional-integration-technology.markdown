This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 393 270 filed Mar. 30 2006 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 545 667 the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

This invention was made with U.S. Government support under Government Contract No. N66001 04 C 8032 awarded by the Defense Advance Research Projects Agency DARPA . The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.

The present invention relates generally to field programmable circuits as related to three dimensional integration and more particularly to a programmable via structure suitable for use in three dimensional integration technology.

Traditionally application specific integrated circuit ASIC devices have been used in the integrated circuit IC industry to reduce cost enhance performance or meet space constraints. The generic class of ASIC devices falls under a variety of sub classes such as custom ASICs standard cell ASICs Gate Array and Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA wherein the degree of user allowed customization varies.

In recent years there has been a move away from custom semi custom and Gate Array ICs toward field programmable components whose function is determined not when the integrated circuit is fabricated but by an end user in the field prior to use. Off the shelf FPGA products greatly simplify the design cycle and are fully customized by the user. These products offer user friendly software to fit custom logic into the device through programmability and the capability to tweak and optimize designs to improve silicon performance. While such programmability is expensive in terms of silicon real estate it reduces design cycle time time to solution TTS and upfront non recurring engineering NRE costs to the designer.

Reconfigurable circuits such as FPGAs are also anticipated to play a significant role in the new Three Dimensional Integration 3DI technology currently under development. In planar circuit technologies i.e. the individual circuit elements are formed on a single planar substrate an FPGA as shown in is characterized by a set of simple configurable logic blocks arranged in an array with interspersed switches that can rearrange the interconnections between the logic blocks .

In contrast 3DI structures such as shown in consist of multiple semiconductor layers DL DL etc. that are interconnected in a vertical direction. In a multilayer logic network this three dimensionality may be exploited to increase density without reducing feature size and reduce the line of flight interconnect path between logic elements. Optimal communication efficiency can thus be achieved in this context by introducing reconfigurable interconnects. Reconfigurable interconnects also offer the possibility for multi use chips thereby enabling compatibility with different communication protocols. Moreover technologically disparate multilayer structures can form unique single chip combinations such as logic memory logic optical communications and logic sensors for example. In these types of multicomponent multilayer systems reconfigurable connections are therefore needed to provide the controllable logic functionality memory element repair and data encryption etc.

Existing field programmable logic and memory repair technology utilizes several methods to physically make break the connections between logic blocks unfortunately none of these existing methods provides a fully adequate solution to the requirements of a 3DI application. For instance a laser fusible link is an early approach but has now replaced by electrical techniques entirely internal to the chip. Electromigration fuses such as those in IBM s eFUSE technology for rerouting chip logic are also currently in use. However an electromigration fuse takes up a large circuit area and requires a high current to blow the fuse. Moreover the process is one shot i.e. once the fuse is blown it cannot thereafter be returned to a conducting state. Further the distribution of eFuse characteristics is relatively broad requiring that the state of each fuse be sensed by a discriminating circuit with the digital result stored in a latch.

Another existing approach for FPGA is the use of flash bits to control a pass transistor for each interconnection. A flash bit takes up space in the logic level is formed by a process that is incompatible with standard CMOS processing and requires a special high voltage to charge the gate oxide. As compared to a laser blown fuse or an eFuse the flash approach is considered limited multi shot technique e.g. about 20 000 reversals .

An anti fuse approach used for some DRAM repair typically involves a very thin dielectric material such as silicon dioxide or the sandwich combination silicon oxide nitride oxide ONO between two conductors. The anti fuse is programmed by applying a relatively high voltage through the conducting terminals thus causing dielectric breakdown in the dielectric. As a result the resistance of the anti fuse permanently changes from high to low. Accordingly this represents another example of a one shot technique one that requires a high voltage.

The controllable link technologies described above do not have optimal properties for programmable logic applications in 3DI or even for planar applications for that matter . In particular a dependency on the use of high voltages whether for gate charging in flash bit applications or for dielectric antifuses is undesirable. In the case of flash bits their presence in the logic level real estate may cause process incompatibilities as described above. Electromigration fuses driven by relatively high current are large area require undesirably high power and require an additional discriminator and latch circuitry. Furthermore devices incorporating static RAM latches are subject to soft error arising from alpha particles or cosmic rays which in a 3DI application may also have the effect of randomly altering the logic configuration. With the exception of flash bit technology which has limited multi shot capability conventional fuse based approaches are one shot.

Accordingly it would therefore be desirable to be able to configure a programmable link for a 3DI application that does not require high current or voltage to program that is compatible with standard CMOS processing at the device level that avoids the need for an SRAM latch to minimize space and avoid soft errors and that is reprogrammable for a significant number of multiple instances i.e. not single shot .

The foregoing discussed drawbacks and deficiencies of the prior art are overcome or alleviated by a programmable link structure for use in three dimensional integration 3DI semiconductor devices. In an exemplary embodiment the structure includes a via filled at least in part with a phase change material PCM and a heating device proximate the PCM. The heating device is configured to switch the conductivity of a transformable portion of the PCM between a lower resistance crystalline state and a higher resistance amorphous state. Thereby the via defines a programmable link between an input connection located at one end thereof and an output connection located at another end thereof.

In another embodiment a method for programming a programmable link structure of a three dimensional integration 3DI semiconductor devices includes passing a current through a heating device the heating device proximate a via filled at least in part with a phase change material PCM the via thereby defining a programmable link between an input connection located at one end thereof and an output connection located at another end thereof. The heating device is configured to switch the conductivity of a transformable portion of said PCM between a lower resistance crystalline state and a higher resistance amorphous state.

Disclosed herein is a programmable via structure suitable for use in 3DI technology. Briefly stated a phase change material PCM is incorporated into a programmable via structure wherein the conductivity of the via is altered by a thermal SET or RESET process that changes the crystal properties of the PCM and therefore the conductivity of the same. Thus configured the PCM based programmable vias provide such desirable advantages as for example spatial compactness the elimination of a need for latches multiple shot reprogrammability immunity from soft errors and the elimination of the need for high voltage current power switching capability. Such advantages in turn provide improved function and lower costs in 3D applications. As will be further appreciated the advantages of PCM programmable vias are not necessarily limited to 3DI structures but rather the PCM programmable links may also be used in planar silicon environments so as to provide an alternative to FPGA.

As described in further detail a PCM programmable via is formed within the metal layers of a semiconductor device and may have a standard via cross section for the particular node e.g. about 0.2 m 0.2 m . The PCM via material may be switched between resistive and conductive states by using an external heating element operated in a programmed heat cycle. The power requirement for switching of the PCM from a non conductive amorphous state to a conductive crystalline state and vice versa is within available line voltage supplies. In addition because the on and off impedances are suitable for direct interfacing with logic inputs no latch devices are required. Furthermore the PCM via structure may be reprogrammed a very large number of times e.g. PCM memory elements test up to on the order of about 10cycles .

In one embodiment the phase change material PCM is a ternary alloy of germanium Ge antimony Sb and tellurium Te hereinafter referred to as GST with an exemplary composition of GeSbTe however other compositions such as GeSb including substitution addition of other elements are also possible for the PCM. Table I below illustrates a comparison of resistivity specific heat and thermal conductivity of various insulative conductive and phase change materials associated with via level materials in a semiconductor device 

At room temperature and up to moderately elevated temperatures the PCM material is stable in two phases a crystalline phase which is a moderately good conductor of electricity and an amorphous phase which is insulating as shown in Table I. Thus in the crystalline phase the state of a PCM link is on while in the amorphous phase the state is off. The phases are switched from one to another by one of two thermal cycling operations as illustrated in . More specifically the thermal cycling includes a RESET pulse for converting the PCM from crystalline to amorphous form and a SET pulse for converting the PCM from amorphous to crystalline form. During the RESET pulse the temperature of the PCM is raised above its melting temperature T followed by a rapid quench over a short time t. As a result of the rapid quench the disordered arrangement of atoms of the PCM due to the melt is retained. Thus the PCM is left in an amorphous high resistive state after the RESET pulse. During the SET pulse the PCM is annealed at a lower temperature with respect to the melting temperature and for a longer time twith respect to t. This process enables the amorphous form to crystallize into a lower resistive state.

As also indicated above the ternary GST alloy is nitrogen doped in order to raise the crystallization temperature thereof so that the material remains bistable at an operating temperature of approximately 85 95 C. In other words it is undesirable for the GST alloy to be susceptible to phase change once programmed where the circuit is operating at temperatures normally designed for. is a graph illustrating the resistivity of the various states amorphous amorphous rocksalt hex crystalline of GeSbTe as a function of nitrogen doping. As GeSbalso has a more elevated crystallization temperature than undoped GeSbTe this PCM material need not be doped.

Referring generally now to several possible embodiments of a programmable via structure incorporating a PCM are illustrated. As indicated above the vias therein may have the standard cross section a aat a particular node e.g. a 0.2 m or lower and may be comprised wholly or partly of phase change material PCM . A heater used to implement the SET and RESET operations includes a thin layer e.g. thickness on the order of about t 20 nm of a refractory material such as TaSiN which has a relatively high resistivity on the order of about 400 cm depending on composition and a relatively low thermal conductivity on the order of about 0.01 0.02 J K cm sec . Heating is accomplished by passing a pulse of current through the heater in the horizontal plane. During RESET quench from melt a thin region of the PCM adjacent to the heater surface is melted and transformed to the amorphous phase. This thin region corresponds to the transformable part of the via material.

As particularly shown in and a first embodiment of a programmable via structure includes a heater deposited as a film e.g. TaSiN on an insulator material such as SiOfor example . The heater material preferably has a thermal conductivity on the order of about 0.01 0.02 J K cm sec or lower and forms a planar interface with the bottom of a PCM via . In this geometry the transformable part of the via material forms a very thin layer e.g. having thickness on the order of about t 4 nm or larger adjacent to the heater surface. When the via is in the off state the resistance of the thin layer constitutes the off resistance of the via. When the via is in the on state the whole length of the via plus a part of the heater forms the on resistance. These resistances are key to the via function and are estimated below.

In the first embodiment of and the heater power supply current path is through metal contacts disposed on opposite sides of the heater with respect to the PCM interface. Such a design permits a TaSiN lead length external to the PCM material of one half the via width. As also shown in the embodiment of and the programmable via structure provides a programmable link between an input connection IP located at an upper metal level M and an output connection OP located at a lower metal level M thus enabling a programmable configuration between distinct semiconductor layers in a 3D structure. In this instance the heater contacts are disposed at an intermediate metal level M between M and M. A conventional via e.g. filled with tungsten is used to connect M to M.

In most cases except for a later embodiment presented hereinafter and a variant of the heater circuit is assumed to be isolated and floating when the heater is not operative. Its effect on the via during logic operation is thus a small parasitic capacitance. As illustrated in a later embodiment if it becomes desirable to electrically insulate the heater from the via a very thin intervening oxide layer may be included therebetween e.g. having a thickness on the order of about 5 nm .

The insulating layer on top of the transformable section of PCM and between the input and output contacts is selected so as to have a low thermal conductivity e.g. 0.002 0.007 J K cm sec for satisfactory operation. One suitable material in this regard is NBLOK nitrogen doped silicon carbide .

For each of the above described embodiments using both the geometry of the designs and the material properties shown in Table I the on and off resistances of the embodiments may be estimated approximately as shown in Table II below 

The above approximations further take into account a via square cross section with dimension a 0.2 m a total via height h 0.2 m a thickness of transformable PCM layer t 4.0 nm or larger and a spacing between vias d 0.2 m.

The on and off resistance requirements are appreciated upon consideration of a logic configuration such as shown in . In this example the PCM elements in lines A and B are in the amorphous high resistance configuration while the PCM element in line C is in the crystalline low resistance state. The inverter in line C drives the output inverter at line D through the on PCM link which must have a low enough resistance to support a correct logic state and timing. The PCM on link resistances in Table I are on the order of about 1 K as is required to satisfy this condition in CMOS logic. However in a performance related path where the PCM via on resistance is such as to degrade performance a buffer not shown may be inserted.

In evaluating the off link resistance it is assumed that inverter outputs A and B are logically low and that inverter output C is high. In this case inverter is through line D driving two off PCM vias in parallel. This should be a light load in order to maintain CMOS functionality. It is also desirable for this path to draw as small a parasitic current as possible. The relatively high off resistances indicated in Table I should ensure these conditions adequately. Thus the programmable via designs along with the chosen materials should be embeddable in CMOS logic without requiring additional latches. Timing studies may be performed in order to take into account the parasitic capacitance of the heater circuits except for the embodiment of where the capacitance of the thin oxide layer is relevant.

Referring once again to the programmable via structures of exemplary processing operations for forming the same are now discussed. Generally each begins with a substrate material such as silicon. A thermally and electrically insulating layer such as SiO for example about 200 nm in thickness is then deposited. The thermal conductivity of the insulating layer is preferably in the range of about 0.01 0.02 J K cm sec or less and the material should be temperature stable in the device operating range.

In the embodiment of the bottom contact layer M e.g. W or Cu is deposited on top of a thermally and electrically insulating layer e.g. SiO . After patterning the M layer an oxide is deposited. The SiOis patterned to align via V e.g. about 0.2 0.2 m with the M level which again represents the metallization level for the heater. The contact vias at M may be filled with a suitable metal such a tungsten for example. Following a suitable planarizing step a refractory metal H layer e.g. about 20 nm in thickness is deposited. This refractory metal layer e.g. TaSiN NiCr or doped CrO is then patterned as an external heater. Another planarization CMP step may be utilized to insure a flat interface between the subsequently formed PCM and the heater layer H. The heater formation is followed by a deposition of SiOwhich is patterned to make a via e.g. about 0.2 0.2 m to be filled with PCM including suitable adhesion and capping layers at the opposite ends of the PCM plug such as Ti TiN . The top metallization layer M is then deposited and patterned to make contacts to the filled vias. In this structure the V contact vias are configured to connect to the bottom logic layer in the 3DI scheme.

In the embodiment of the metallization level M is deposited directly on top of SiO without first building the M and V levels . This is followed by formation of the heater H level where the interface for the next step should be planar. The oxide is then deposited and patterned with vias to be filled with PCM with capping layers and thereafter the operations are repeated to create conventional metallic vias with both types of vias contacting the M level. The embodiments in are configured to minimize the length of the heater leads so as to optimize power requirements. It will be noted that the specific details of the heater driving circuits are omitted for purposes of simplicity.

In the embodiment of the process flow is substantially the same as for . However one difference is that the V via of is filled with PCM including the appropriate capping layers. PCM via V which is built after the planarization step following the deposition of the H heater layer is connected to the V via underneath the heater. At this point a CMP step is used to control the flatness of the interface between PCM and the next layer H and thus to control morphology of the melt front. This process will result in a symmetrical PCM via structure interrupted by a heater in the middle thereof. After filling the V via with PCM and suitable top capping layers contact is made to the M contact level.

In the embodiment of the process flow is substantially the same as that for except that both vias atop the heater level are PCM filled. The processing for the embodiment shown in is somewhat similar to that of although a thin insulating layer O may additionally be needed to electrically separate the H heater layer from the PCM to ensure a desired ON OFF ratio . The distinguishing feature of the embodiment is the thin e.g. about 5 nm PCM layer that forms a fully transformable PCM element bridging two crystalline PCM vias. This thin layer is first blanket deposited and patterned over a larger area encompassing the two vias in the programmable structure. A SiOlayer is then deposited and patterned with vias to be filled with PCM as described previously.

In the embodiment of there are alternating PCM and heater material levels PCM H PCM as is shown in . In this instance however following the M level formation the subsequent level formation is as follows M SiO heater H and SiO. Then the vias are formed by pattering and etching the entire SiO H SiOstack followed by filling with the PCM. The top metallization M level e.g. using tungsten will follow as described above. In this structure an insulating lining on the vias may be desirable to electrically isolate the heater from the PCM as stated above.

Alternatively tungsten only may be used in the contact vias and the metal lines are fabricated by damascene processing using copper. For example the process flow for the embodiment of would involve first oxide deposition patterning and RIE of the M layer M plating and CMP followed by defining the H layer then another oxide deposition deep multi level RIE PCM fill and CMP.

In the embodiments of the primary heat propagation direction is normal to the film plane along the direction z. For illustration purposes diffusive heat propagation is first considered as a purely one dimensional process in the z direction. Three dimensional simulations presented in a later section give a more accurate measure of the power requirements. For a semi infinite medium of heat conductivity K and specific heat C per unit volume being heated at its surface located at z 0 starting at time t 0 the equation obeyed by temperature T z t is the diffusion equation 

where z square root over 4Dt Tis ambient temperature and Tis the temperature rise at switch off. The temperature evolution at the surface z 0 is given by 

where A is heater surface area in the xy plane. Thermal properties of some of the key materials are given in Table I above.

Application of this formula to an area of 0.2 0.2 m a 0.2 m T 700 C and t 2.0 ns including the Table I parameters gives for heater powers into a semi infinite medium W 0.35 mW for GST W 1.1 mW for SiO the relative magnitudes of Wand Wtrack the KC product which is much smaller for GST than for SiO .

In considering the design of the embodiments it is assumed for purposes of simplicity that the heater relatively rapidly equilibrates with the medium. For example the internal heater heat diffusion time

with 20 nm and assuming C 2 JKcm gives 0.1 ns which is very short compared with other times of interest. However this will not necessarily be the case in all situations 3D simulations confirm this fast equilibrium in a more realistic geometry. Estimated heat loss in the TaSiN 0.1 m leads with a maximum temperature drop of 700 C. along the length would be about 60 W per lead. However in practice the leads also heat up to nearly T making the heat loss from the leads relatively low compared with the heater power. Hence an approximate analysis may be made based on treating the heater as a sheet source of power with uniform power per unit area.

Proceeding on this assumption the heater powers emitted from each side of the heater strip are summed to obtain the total heater power. In the structure of the effective heater strip length is taken as 2.0a. The values shown below in Table IIIa are then obtained for the required heater power for the designs of the embodiments in .

In the embodiment of the heat is dissipated partly into oxide on both sides and partly into GST on both sides. The heater length is again taken as 2a giving the result indicated in Table IIIa. A more accurate result is given in the section on 3D simulations where this case is considered. The power required during the melt phase is 1.9 mW for a heater slab measuring 0.2 0.2 0.01875 cubic microns.

In the embodiment of the estimate is similar to that for except that there are two PCM vias and thus the heater length is taken as 4a with a corresponding increase in heat lost to oxide. In the estimate is similar to . An estimate for the embodiment of is given in a following section where the 3D simulations of this case are presented the result is 2.8 mW during the melt phase for a heater slab measuring 0.2 0.2 0.01875 cubic microns.

By way of comparison the results shown in Table IIIb below are those corresponding to a via of width 0.1 m and to a TaSiN heater composition with a resistivity about 10 times than indicated in Table I with a PCM resistivity of about 0.25 times that in Table I to maintain the on and off impedances in Table II. Alternatively retaining the Table I PCM material the PCM portion of the via may be reduced in height to about 50 nm and filling the remaining portion with conventional conductor material e.g. tungsten thus keeping the same on with a higher off resistance. These modified resistivity values lie within the range achievable by composition control.

The heater voltage may in some cases require the option of using the available I O line power supplies e.g. 2 3 V . Current is also a significant consideration because it controls the width of the driving FET which is typically larger than the via itself. Here the smaller via dimensions Table IIIb combined with a higher resistivity heater material is advantageous in this respect to the larger vias used in Table IIIa.

In considering scaling at constant programming power supply voltage and at fixed technology the power needed to drive a via of diameter a scales as a where for the current I C constant I Ca.

The transistor width is typically the controlling dimension of the device w a hence the total device dimension scales as a. There is thus a strong motivation based on minimizing total programmable via device area to make the via as small as possible since device dimension goes as its square. Individual designs will also need to be optimized to the precise line voltage so as to minimize current and hence device dimension.

For an analysis of the programming of the PCM vias certain additional factors that are taken into account in addition to heat diffusion include latent heat of melting of the PCM as well as the kinetics of the propagating front corresponding to the melt interface. This is done through a numerical approach for heat and melt front propagation within the GST layer. First a one dimensional model of a basic melt front is described because of its mathematical simplicity. In the following subsection three dimensional simulations of two designs are described.

Including latent heat conservation of energy modifies the diffusion equation for temperature T z t in the GST subscripts G refer to GST to 

The equation for the melt fraction dynamics is based on modified Wilson Frenkel kinetics with friction described by the Vogel Fulcher form appropriate for fragile glasses and is given as 

in which Vis a characteristic velocity Eis the activation energy for the transition from the amorphous to the crystalline phase Sis the melt entropy Tis the melt temperature Tis a glass temperature and temperatures are measured from absolute zero. Only propagation of the melt front x not homogeneous nucleation is taken into account due to the relatively long nucleation time s even in thick films of some materials though it may be faster in others anticipated in nanometer thickness films relative to the ns time scales of interest in RESET a fast SET process is also assumed here although time scales may be more extended in optimal engineering operation . In practice numerical requirements dictate certain modifications to the basic procedure.

It will be noted that low temperature crystallization rates obey Arrhenius kinetics A exp E kT where Eis a low temperature activation energy of order 2 3 eV. This analysis is an appropriate one for considering archival storage lifetime.

The boundary condition at the PCM surface for RESET is obtained from the approximate analysis of the previous subsection the temperature profile being extended beyond the turn off time tusing the shift theorem to give a profile qualitatively like that in 

In this equation t tand T T Tin the notation of Table IV. The parameters in Table IV are partly based on an experimental study of laser annealed spot crystallization kinetics in rotating PCM coated disks. The maximum recrystallization front velocity is 2.2 m s.

The results of the simulation with the foregoing parameters are shown in which illustrates a plot of the melt front location vs. time in the quench and anneal steps. The anneal temperature is set at the maximum recrystallization velocity thus the recrystallization time is relatively short.

The latent heat is relatively low and thus for approximation purposes it may be neglected completely though simulations have also been successfully implemented in which significant latent heat values have been included . illustrates graphical results of a study for zero latent heat of the engineering envelope for the amorphization process. This is significant since both heater power and turn off time need to be adjusted to the PCM material characteristics. The Table IV parameters are used except that three velocity prefactors 500 900 and 1300 mswere used and parameterized by the maximum recrystallization front velocities and the heater power and turn off time were varied continuously. Amorphization is deemed possible where the long time amorphous layer thickness exceeded 2.5 nm. Amorphization with increasingly thick layers occurs above the parabola like curves in . Lines of constant heater power are defined by the dashed lines. As is illustrated faster velocities require higher heater powers raising the PCM to a higher temperature along with shorter times. For a given velocity there is typically a minimum power and a minimum temperature below which amorphization does not occur. A narrow range of turn off times is appropriate for a given velocity and maximum temperature T.

Three dimensional simulations of PCM encased in oxide with a metal heater were run to determine the geometry and time scale for the melt quench and anneal processes. In particular a snapshot from a simulation with a solid slab of heating material in the separating plane between two PCM oxide composites embodiment of was compared with a snapshot of the melting phase of another model with a ring of heating material and an oxide shell surrounding a continuous PCM volume embodiment of . The results for the ring heater are similar to those for the slab heater with slight differences in the shape of the melt front. These simulations also matched the results of the 1D simulations for the same 1D geometry. With the full 3D configuration of the heater and PCM material the simulations confirm that the design performs as intended. The 3D simulations also provide a better power estimate for the operation of the via as they involve no simplifying assumptions about the geometry the boundary conditions or 3D heat diffusion.

The physical constants introduced in the previous section were used along with 3D versions of the equations which are in dimensionless form 

Here T T C K and L are the dimensionless specific heat thermal conductivity and latent heat of fusion t and are dimensionless time and gradient fis the melt fraction and V is the speed of the melt front 

The temperature is controlled by the time and position dependent heat input H. The rate of change of fat any point depends on the distance between that point and the nearest melt front surface. The width of the melt front is taken to be r T Tis the normalized glass transition temperature. Dimensionless constants V and were determined from the physical constants given in the previous sections.

The calculation is straightforward using finite differences for the derivatives with a rectilinear grid of cells and fare cell centered quantities. The melt front is defined by the central points of all the cell walls that straddle cell volumes where f0.5. The nearest distance between a cell position and the melt front is determined by first finding the three nearest points on the melt front. These three points define a plane and the perpendicular distance between the cell position and the plane is determined by vector trigonometry.

For both the slab and ring heater models the PCM is on the inside of an oxide shell. The PCM outer dimensions are 100 100 131.25 nm while the outer dimensions of the oxide shell are 200 200 231.25 nm. Smaller samples were also simulated they show the same behavior but have shorter timescales for all the phase changes.

The temperature structure inside the model is much smoother than the melt structure which has sharp fronts separating the different phases. To resolve fwithout doing unnecessary calculations for the simulation uses a fine grid for fand a coarse grid for . For temperature the simulations in the ring case use a grid measuring 32 32 37 cells with PCM in the central 16 16 21 cells. The heater measures 32 32 3 cells with the central 16 16 3 cut out and filled with PCM connected to the rest of the PCM. In the slab case the heater bifurcates the PCM by occupying the horizontal midplane in 32 32 3 cells. In all cases the PCM has a grid for melt fraction f which is 4 times finer than the temperature grid.

The heating function H is taken to be a constant for three intervals of time. During the melting phase H is large enough to make the peak temperature in the heating zone increase to about 1.5. In the quench phase H 0 so the material returns to room temperature. In the anneal phase H comes back on for 200 ns but with a value slightly smaller than in the melt phase now making the peak equilibrate to around 0.98.

The simulations indicate that the PCM in our configurations develop melted holes in the center during the SET phase thereby changing the electrical conductivity from top to bottom as required by the device. The PCM is quenched when the heating rate is dropped suddenly and it anneals when the temperature is raised to just below the melting temperature.

The power required to melt the PCM in the ring simulation was 2.8 mW for a heater measuring 0.2 0.2 0.01875 cubic microns the power for the slab simulation was slightly less 1.9 mW for the same dimensions. The slab required less power than the ring because the slab has a greater area in contact with the PCM.

Finally the considerations for selection of an appropriate PCM are summarized below. As was alluded to previously suitable PCM materials include not only Ge Sb and Te but also other elements such as Ag In Sn for example as well as dopants such as N. Generally speaking desirable PCM properties include archival stability at about 85 95 C. which tends to improve with Ge content. In addition crystallization front speed may be on the order of about V

As indicated above the on off ratio is preferably high while the on resistance depending upon the particular structural embodiment preferably utilizes a high conductance material such as GeSb e.g. . For other designs however the off resistance requirements dictates the use of a lower conductance material.

While the invention has been described with reference to a preferred embodiment or embodiments it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof. Therefore it is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiment disclosed as the best mode contemplated for carrying out this invention but that the invention will include all embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims.
