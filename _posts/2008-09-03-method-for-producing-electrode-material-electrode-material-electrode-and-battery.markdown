The International Application was published in Japanese on 11 Mar. 2010 as WO 2010 026627.

The present invention relates to a method for producing an electrode material an electrode material an electrode and a battery and particularly to a method for producing an electrode material suitable for a positive electrode material for a battery and furthermore a positive electrode material for a lithium ion battery an electrode material produced by the above method a positive electrode formed using the above electrode material and a battery including the above positive electrode.

In recent years as a battery expected to be miniaturized weight reduced and capacity increased a non aqueous electrolyte based secondary battery such as a lithium ion battery has been suggested and provided for practical uses.

The lithium ion battery includes a positive electrode and a negative electrode which are capable of reversibly extracting and inserting lithium ions and a non aqueous electrolyte.

As a negative electrode material of a lithium ion battery a Li containing metal oxide capable of reversibly extracting and inserting lithium ions such as in general a carbon based material or a lithium titanium oxide LiTiO is used as a negative electrode active material.

On the other hand as a positive electrode material of a lithium ion battery a Li containing metal oxide capable of reversibly extracting and inserting lithium ions such as lithium iron phosphate LiFePO or an electrode material mixture including a binder or the like is used as a positive electrode active material. In addition the positive electrode of a lithium ion battery is formed by coating the electrode material mixture on the surface of a metal foil called a collector.

Compared with conventional secondary batteries such as lead batteries nickel cadmium batteries nickel hydrogen batteries and the like lithium ion batteries are used as power supplies for portable electronic devices such as mobile phones and notebook type personal computers due to the light weight small size and high energy thereof. In addition recently lithium ion batteries has been studied as high output power supplies for electric vehicles hybrid vehicles electric power tools and the like and in order to be used as high output power supplies for them the batteries need to have high speed charging and discharging characteristics. However an electrode active material for example an electrode material including a Li containing metal oxide capable of reversibly extracting and inserting lithium ions has a problem of low electronic conductivity.

Therefore as a method to improve the electronic conductivity of an electrode material it is disclosed that for example a plurality of primary particles consisting of an empirical formula of LiABPO herein A is at least one selected from Cr Mn Fe Co Ni and Cu B is at least one selected from Mg Ca Sr Ba Ti Zn B Al Ga In Si Ge Sc Y and rare earth elements and 0 x

However in the method in which a plurality of primary particles consisting of the above empirical formula of LiABPOare collected so as to form a secondary particle and carbon is interposed between the primary particles the carbon content needs to be high to provide sufficient electronic conductivity. As a result there are problems in that the amount of the electrode active material in an electrode material of LiABPO which is an electrode active material and carbon which is an electrical conductivity assisting agent that provides electronic conductivity and furthermore the amount of the electrode active material in an electrode material mixture including the electrode material a binder and the like decrease and a battery having a high discharge capacity and a sufficient charge and discharge rate performance during a high speed charge and discharge process cannot be produced.

The present invention has been made in consideration of such problems and the object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing an electrode material capable of realizing a high discharge capacity and a sufficient charge and discharge rate performance at a high speed charge and discharge rate an electrode material an electrode and a battery.

As a result of thorough studies to solve the above problems the inventors of the present invention have found that an electrode material capable of realizing a sufficient charge and discharge rate performance can be produced by collecting a plurality of primary particles of an electrode active material so as to form a secondary particle coating the surface of the primary particles with thin film like carbon and interposing the carbon between the primary particles thereby increasing the electron supplying capacity thereof and have completed the present invention. That is the inventors of the present invention have found that by using a mixture of plural kinds of organic compounds having different shapes even with the same amount of carbon an electrode material exhibiting a uniquely high electrical conductivity can be obtained and have completed the present invention.

According to the method for producing an electrode material according to the present invention it is possible to provide an electrode material capable of realizing a high discharge capacity and a sufficient charge and discharge rate performance during a high speed charge and discharge process since the electrode material is produced by spraying and drying a slurry including an electrode active material or the precursor of an electrode active material and organic compounds selected respectively from at least two groups of the following group A group B and group C so as to produce a granule and firing the granule in a non oxidizing atmosphere at a temperature of from 500 C. to 1000 C.

The embodiments of the method for producing an electrode material the electrode material the electrode and the battery according to the present invention will be described.

Here the embodiments are to describe the present invention in detail to make the gist of the present invention more easily understood and unless otherwise described do not limit the present invention.

The first embodiment of the method for producing an electrode material according to the present invention is a method that synthesizes an electrode material by spraying and drying a slurry including an electrode active material and organic compounds selected respectively from at least two groups of the following group A group B and group C so as to produce a granule and firing the granule in a non oxidizing atmosphere at a temperature of from 500 C. to 1000 C.

Here organic compounds belonging to each of the group A group B and group C are one or two or more selected from each group.

The organic compounds of the group A can include polyvinyl alcohol polyvinyl pyrrolidone cellulose starch gelatin carboxymethyl cellulose methyl cellulose hydroxymethyl cellulose hydroxyethyl cellulose polyacrylic acid polystyrene sulfonic acid polyacrylamide polyvinyl acetate and the like. Among these organic compounds polyvinyl alcohol and polyacrylic acid are preferred since they can form a preferable carbon film with the addition of a small amount due to the excellent film forming properties thereof.

The organic compounds of the group B can include glucose fructose galactose mannose maltose sucrose lactose glycogen pectin alginic acid glucomannan chitin hyaluronic acid chondroitin agarose and the like.

As the organic compounds of the group C polyether or multivalent alcohols except organic compounds belonging to the groups A and B can be used and examples thereof can include polyethylene glycol polypropylene glycol polyglycerin glycerin and the like.

The electrode active material preferably includes as the main component one selected from the group consisting of lithium cobaltate lithium nickelate lithium manganate lithium titanate and compounds represented by the empirical formula of LiABPO herein A is one or two or more selected from the group consisting of Co Mn Ni Fe Cu and Cr B is at least one or two or more selected from the group consisting of Mg Ca Sr Ba Ti Zn B Al Ga In Si Ge Sc Y and rare earth elements and 0 x

From the standpoint of high discharge potential abundant reserves stability and the like A is preferably Mn Fe Co and Ni B is preferably Mg Ca Sr Ti Zn and Al.

Here examples of the rare earth elements can include La Ce Pr Nd Pm Sm Eu Gd Tb Dy Ho Er Tm Yb Lu and the like.

As the compounds represented by the empirical formula of LiABPO LiABPOpowder compounds produced by a conventional method such as a solid phase method a liquid phase method a vapor phase method and the like can be used.

Preferable examples of the compounds represented by the empirical formula of LiABPOcan include compounds for example synthesized by feeding and thermally synthesizing a slurry like mixture obtained by mixing an Li source selected from a group consisting of a lithium salt such as lithium acetate LiCHCOO lithium chloride LiCl and the like and lithium hydroxide LiOH a divalent iron salt such as iron II chloride FeCl iron II acetate Fe CHCOO and the like a phosphate compound such as phosphoric acid HPO ammonium phosphate NHHPO diammonium hydrogen phosphate NH HPO and the like and water in an airtight pressure resistant container washing the obtained sediment with water so as to produce a cake like precursor material and firing the cake like precursor material.

In addition the LiABPOpowder may be either crystalline particles or amorphous particles and also may be a mixture of crystalline and amorphous particles. The reason why the LiABPOpowder may also be amorphous particles is that amorphous LiABPOpowder is crystallized when thermally treated in a non oxidizing atmosphere at a temperature of from 500 C. to 1000 C.

The size of the LiABPOpowder is not particularly limited but the average particle diameter of the primary particles is preferably from 0.01 m to 20 m and more preferably from 0.02 m to 5 m.

With an average particle diameter of the primary particles of less than 0.01 m it becomes difficult to sufficiently coat the surface of the primary particles with thin film like carbon therefore the discharge capacity during a high speed charge and discharge process decreases and thus it becomes difficult to realize a sufficient charge and discharge rate performance. On the other hand if the average particle diameter of the primary particles exceeds 20 m the resistance inside the primary particles increases therefore the discharge capacity during a high speed charge and discharge process becomes insufficient.

Furthermore the shape of the LiABPOpowder is not particularly limited but is preferably spherical and more preferably truly spherical since it is easy to produce an electrode material made of spherical in particular truly spherical secondary particles.

The reason why the preferable shape of an electrode material is spherical is that it is possible to decrease the amount of a solvent when preparing a paste for producing a positive electrode by mixing the electrode material a binder resin binding agent and the solvent and also the coating of the paste for producing a positive electrode to a collector becomes easy.

In addition if the shape of the electrode material is spherical the surface area of the electrode material becomes minimized and the mixing amount of a binder resin binding agent added to an electrode material mixture can be minimized therefore it is possible to decrease the internal resistance of the obtained positive electrode. Furthermore since a spherical shape is easy to pack more densely the amount of the positive electrode material packed per unit volume becomes large and thus the electrode density can be increased therefore it is possible to provide a high capacity lithium ion battery.

The mixture ratio of the electrode active material to the organic compounds of the group A group B and group C is preferably from 0.1 parts by mass to 30 parts by mass of carbon with respect to 100 parts by mass of the electrode active material when converting the amount of the organic compounds of the group A group B and group C to the amount of carbon.

With a mixture ratio of carbon of less than 0.1 parts by mass the discharge capacity during a high speed charge and discharge process decreases and thus it becomes difficult to realize a sufficient charge and discharge rate performance. On the other hand if the mixture ratio of carbon exceeds 30 parts by mass the mixture ratio of the electrode active material decreases and thus in the case of forming a battery the capacity of the battery becomes low.

In addition a preferable mixture ratio of an organic compound belonging to the group A an organic compound belonging to the group B and an organic compound belonging to the group C is as follows 

That is when Crepresents the amount of carbon generated by thermally treating an organic compound belonging to the group A Crepresents the amount of carbon generated by thermally treating an organic compound belonging to the group B and Crepresents the amount of carbon generated by thermally treating an organic compound belonging to the group C a value obtained by subtracting the minimum amount of carbon weight converted with a condition of not zero among the amounts of carbon C Cand Cfrom the total amount of carbon equivalent to the amount of carbon C C C weight converted is preferably made to be 0.05 or more.

Regarding an organic compound from a group with the minimum mixing amount the above value of less than 0.05 means that the method does not use plural kinds of organic compounds with different shapes but rather that the method uses substantially only one kind of organic compound.

The electrode active material and the organic compounds selected respectively from at least two groups of the group A group B and group C are dissolved or dispersed in water so as to prepare a uniform slurry.

The method for dispersing the electrode active material and the organic compounds of the group A group B and group C in water is not particularly limited as long as it is a method that disperses the electrode active material and dissolves or disperses the organic compounds of the group A group B and group C but for example a method using a medium stirring type dispersing apparatus that can stir medium particles at a high speed such as a planetary ball mill a vibrating ball mill a beads mill a paint shaker an attritor and the like is preferred.

At this time it is preferable to disperse the electrode active material into the primary particles and to stir the organic compounds of the group A group B and group C so as to be dissolved. Thereby the surface of the primary particles of the electrode active material is coated with the organic compounds of the group A group B and group C and consequently carbon derived from the organic compounds of the group A group B and group C is uniformly interposed between the primary particles of the electrode active material.

Next the slurry is sprayed and dried in a high temperature atmosphere for example in the atmosphere with a temperature of from 70 C. to 250 C. so as to produce a granule.

Subsequently the granule is fired in a non oxidizing atmosphere with a temperature of from 500 C. to 1000 C. and more preferably from 600 C. to 900 C. Thereby the surface of the primary particles of the electrode active material is coated with carbon produced by the thermal decomposition of the organic compounds of the group A group B and group C so as to obtain an electrode material made of the secondary particles in which the carbon has been interposed between the primary particles of the electrode active material.

With a firing temperature of the granule of less than 500 C. the decomposition and reaction of the organic compounds of the group A group B and group C do not proceed sufficiently and the carbonization of the organic compounds is insufficient thereby producing a highly resistant decomposed material of the organic compounds. On the other hand if the firing temperature of the granule exceeds 1000 C. Li in the electrode active material is vaporized which leads to not only the occurrence of compositional deviation but also the acceleration of the grain growth of the electrode active material therefore the discharge capacity during a high speed charge and discharge process decreases and thus a sufficient charge and discharge rate performance becomes difficult to realize.

In addition as the non oxidizing atmosphere when firing the granule an inert atmosphere such as N Ar and the like is preferable and in the case of further suppressing oxidation a reductive atmosphere such as an atmosphere including a reductive gas such as Hand the like is preferable.

The second embodiment of the method for producing an electrode material according to the present invention is a method that synthesizes an electrode material by spraying and drying a slurry including the precursor of an electrode active material and organic compounds selected respectively from at least two groups of the above group A group B and group C so as to produce a granule and firing the granule in a non oxidizing atmosphere at a temperature of from 500 C. to 1000 C.

Here the precursor of the electrode active material refers to an intermediate raw material obtained by for example thermally treating a mixture of each raw material component of the electrode active material which is not yet an ultimate electrode active material.

Among electrode active materials as the precursor of the compounds represented by the empirical formula of LiABPO an intermediate material obtained by thermally treating a mixture of Li source A source here A is one or more selected from the group consisting of Co Mn Ni Fe Cu and Cr B source B is one or more selected from the group consisting of Mg Ca Sr Ba Ti Zn B Al Ga In Si Ge Sc Y and rare earth elements POsource and water is used.

Examples of methods for producing the intermediate material can include a method that feeds and hydrothermally synthesizes the mixture in an airtight pressure resistant container washes the obtained sediment with water so as to produce a cake like material and a method that sprays and dries the mixture in a high temperature atmosphere so as to produce a granule.

In addition the raw materials used to produce the precursor of the electrode active material are not particularly limited as long as they are combinations from which the target material can be obtained by a general hydrothermal method but an acetate salt a sulfate salt a chloride and the like which are soluble in water are preferred because they can react in water.

Examples of the Li source can include lithium inorganic acid salts such as lithium chloride LiCl lithium bromide LiBr lithium carbonate LiCO lithium nitrate LiNO lithium sulfate LiSO lithium phosphate LiPO lithium hydroxide LiOH and the like and lithium organic acid salts such as lithium acetate LiCHCOO lithium oxalate COOLi and the like lithium alkoxides such as lithium ethoxide LiCHO and Li containing organic metal compounds such as organic lithium compounds such as Li CH and the like.

Preferable examples of the A source can include compounds including one or more of element s selected from the group consisting of Co Mn Ni Fe Cu and Cr and in particular compounds including one or more of element s selected from Mn Fe Co and Ni are preferred from the standpoint of high discharge potential abundant reserves stability and the like.

Examples of such compounds can include as Fe components iron II sulfate FeSO iron II acetate Fe CHCOO iron II chloride FeCl and the like.

Preferable examples of the B source can include compounds including elements which are different from the A source and one or more of elements selected from the group of Mg Ca Sr Ba Ti Zn B Al Ga In Si Ge Sc Y and rare earth elements and in particular compounds including one or more element s selected from Mg Ca Sr Ti Zn and Al are preferred from the standpoint of high discharge potential abundant reserves stability and the like.

Here examples of the rare earth elements can include La Ce Pr Nd Pm Sm Eu Gd Tb Dy Ho Er Tm Yb Lu and the like.

As such compounds one or more of the metal salt s of elements that are from the above elements but different from the A source can be used and preferable examples thereof can include sulfates such as magnesium sulfate MgSO titanium sulfate Ti SO and the like acetates such as magnesium acetate Mg CHCOO and chlorides such as calcium chloride CaCl titanium tetrachloride TiCl and the like.

Examples of the POsource can include phosphoric acids such as orthophosphoric acid HPO metaphosphoric acid HPO and the like ammonium hydrogen phosphate such as diammonium hydrogen phosphate NH HPO ammonium dihydrogen phosphate NHHPO and the like and the like.

Among the above from the standpoint of relatively high purity and ease of conducting a composition control orthophosphoric acid diammonium hydrogen phosphate ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and the like are preferred.

In the second embodiment an electrode material is synthesized in the same manner as in the first embodiment except that instead of the electrode active material a precursor of the electrode active material is used.

As such according to the first and second embodiments of the method for producing an electrode material according to the present invention a slurry in which an electrode active material or the precursor thereof and organic compounds selected respectively from at least two groups of the above group A group B and group C are uniformly dispersed in water is sprayed as fine liquid droplets and dried so as to produce a granule and the granule is fired which makes thermal decomposition of the organic compounds occur instantly thereby forming an electrode material made of secondary particles having carbon interposed between the primary particles of the electrode active material.

In addition by mixing an electrode active material or the precursor thereof and organic compounds selected respectively from at least two groups of the group A group B and group C it becomes easy to design the thickness shape and electrical conducting property of a carbon film that coats the electrode active material due to carbon derived from the organic compounds.

That is although it is not clear why the electrical conducting property is uniquely improved by mixing an electrode active material or the precursor thereof and a plurality of the organic compounds it is considered that for example since the organic compound belonging to the group A has an excellent film producing property a carbon film can be easily formed on the surface of the electrode active material and electrical conducting paths can be formed across an extensive range in the electrode material with a small amount of carbon. In addition it is considered that the organic compound belonging to the group B can easily produce carbon even in a thermal decomposition reaction at a lower temperature and exhibits an excellent electrical conducting property. Furthermore it is considered that the organic compound belonging to the group C improves the leaking property at the surface of the electrode active material and improves the adhesion property between carbon derived from the organic compound belonging to the group A and or carbon derived from the organic compound belonging to the group B and the electrode active material and can dispose carbon derived from the organic compound belonging to the group A and or carbon derived from the organic compound belonging to the group B on the surface of the electrode active material in an optimal shape such as the thickness coating rate coated surface area distance between a coated portion and an opening portion of a film . Therefore when mixing organic compounds selected from plural groups the effects imparted by these organic compounds are coupled therefore compared with a case in which one kind of the organic compound is used the electrical conducting property of the electrode active material is uniquely improved.

Furthermore in the obtained electrode material since plural primary particles of the electrode active material coated with thin film like carbon with a thickness of 50 nm or less are collected so as to form a secondary particle and each primary particle is coated with carbon part of the primary particles constituting the secondary particle which are exposed outside are also coated with thin film like carbon and the primary particles are joined to one another via the thin film like carbon. Here the expression the primary particles are joined to one another does not refer to a state in which the primary particles constitute the secondary particle simply in an aggregation state but refers to a state in which the secondary particle is strongly bonded so as to at least behave like one particle.

The electrode according to the present invention is an electrode formed by using the electrode material according to the present invention.

To produce the electrode according to the present invention a coating material or a paste for producing a positive electrode is prepared by mixing the electrode material according to the present invention a binder resin binding agent and a solvent. At this time an electrical conductivity assisting agent such as carbon black or the like may be added as necessary.

Next the coating material or paste for producing a positive electrode is coated and then dried on one surface of a metal foil thereby obtaining the metal foil having the positive electrode active material maintained at one surface.

Subsequently the positive electrode active material or the like maintained on one surface of the metal foil is pressed to be attached and then dried thereby producing a collector positive electrode having an electrode material layer.

Examples of the binder resin can include a polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE resin polyvinylidene fluoride PVdF and the like.

The mixture ratio of the electrode material and the binder resin is not particularly limited and for example about from 3 parts by mass to 20 parts by mass of the binder resin is mixed with regard to 100 parts by mass of the electrode material.

The battery according to the present invention is a battery including the electrode according to the present invention as the positive electrode.

The battery according to the present invention has no particular limitation on the negative electrode electrolyte separator battery shape and the like.

The battery according to the present invention has a highly pure positive electrode and is formed with the electrode material according to the present invention which is fine spherical particles with similar particle diameters therefore the battery can have a high discharge capacity during a high speed charge and discharge process and a stabilized charge and discharge cycle performance and achieve a high output.

From the results of Table 1 it was understood that the compact resistivity of the electrode materials A1 to A9 of Examples 1 to 9 was significantly different from those of the electrode materials B1 and B2 of Comparative Examples 1 and 2 and the electrical conducting property of the electrode materials A1 to A9 of Examples 1 to 9 was high.

Lithium ion batteries were produced using the electrode materials obtained from Examples 1 to 3 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2.

90 by mass of the electrode material 5 by mass of carbon black as an electrical conductivity assisting agent 5 by mass of polyvinylidene fluoride manufactured by Kureha Chemical Industry Co. Ltd. as a binder resin and N methyl 2 pyrrolidone as a solvent were mixed so as to prepare a paste for producing a positive electrode.

Next the paste for producing a positive electrode was coated and dried on one surface of an aluminum Al foil so as to obtain an aluminum foil having a positive electrode active material maintained at one surface.

Subsequently after the positive electrode active material maintained at one surface of the aluminum foil and the like was punched out a disk shaped hole with a diameter of 16 mm was made on the aluminum foil and dried under vacuum so as to produce a collector positive electrode including an electrode material layer with a thickness of 60 m and a density of 2.2 g cm.

Next a lithium ion battery was produced using a stainless steel SUS 2016 coin type cell under a dried argon Ar atmosphere.

Meanwhile metallic lithium Li a porous polypropylene film and 1 mol L LiPFsolution solvent ethylene carbonate diethyl carbonate 1 1 volume ratio were used respectively as a negative electrode a separator and an electrolyte solution.

The respective lithium ion batteries of Examples 1 to 3 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2 were subjected to a charge and discharge test.

The charge and discharge test was conducted with conditions of an environmental temperature of room temperature 25 C. a cut off voltage of from 2.0 V to 4.2 V a charging rate of 0.2 C constant current and a discharging rate of from 0.1 C to 8 C.

From the results of it was understood that compared with the lithium ion batteries using the electrode materials of Comparative Examples 1 and 2 the lithium ion batteries using the electrode materials of Examples 1 to 3 can realize a high discharge capacity across a range from a low speed charge and discharge rate of 0.1 C to a high speed charge and discharge rate of 8 C and a sufficient charge and discharge rate performance.

The method for producing an electrode material according to the present invention can obtain an electrode material made of secondary particles having carbon interposed between the primary particles of an electrode active material by spraying droplets as fine liquid and drying a slurry including the electrode active material or the precursor thereof and organic compounds selected respectively from at least two groups of the above group A group B and group C uniformly dispersed in water so as to produce a granule and by firing the granule therefore it is possible to further improve the charge and discharge capacity particularly discharge capacity of a lithium ion battery and to achieve the stabilization and high output of charge and discharge cycles. In addition it is also possible to apply the method to a next generation secondary battery which is expected to be further miniaturized weight reduced and capacity increased and therefore the effects will become significantly larger in the case of a next generation secondary battery.
