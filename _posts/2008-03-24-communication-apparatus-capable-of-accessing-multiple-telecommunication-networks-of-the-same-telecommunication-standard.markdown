In recent times utilizing mobile phones for communication has become increasingly popular. At any place and time users can communicate with another one via calling sending messages sending mail etc. In the early stages of development each mobile phone only had a single module which only utilized a single subscriber identity module card i.e. SIM card. As a result a single mobile phone had a corresponding single phone number. When a user utilized two phone numbers or more than two phone numbers the user had to buy two mobile phones or more than two mobile phones to meet his her requirements.

As the communications market develops telecommunication service agents have become numerous and most users own more than two phone numbers. As a result the users need to communicate with each other via more than two mobile phones. However it is not convenient for users to carry two or more mobile phones and this situation can also result in confusion when using mobile phones and increased financial expenditure.

Therefore it is one of the objectives of the claimed invention to provide a communication apparatus of accessing multiple telecommunication networks corresponding to the same telecommunication standard where the communication apparatus is capable of accessing an extra short message service via a short message service controller to solve the aforementioned problems.

These and other objectives of the present invention will no doubt become obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art after reading the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment that is illustrated in the various figures and drawings.

Please refer to . is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary embodiment of a communication apparatus for using a first and second subscriber identifications at the same time for accessing a first telecommunication network and second telecommunication network correspondingly according to one embodiment of the present invention wherein the communication apparatus comprises a first communication circuit for accessing the first telecommunication network according to the first subscriber identification recorded in a first subscriber identity module card a second communication circuit for accessing the second telecommunication network according to the second subscriber identification recorded in a second subscriber identity module card wherein the first telecommunication network and the second telecommunication network correspond to the same telecommunication standard such as Global System for Mobile Communications GSM standard Personal Handyphone System PHs or other available mobile communication system standards a controller coupled to the second communication circuit for controlling operations of the second communication circuit wherein the central controlling device is coupled to the first communication circuit and the controller and the central controlling device is shared by the first communication circuit and the controller . In other words in this embodiment the controller is a dual mode short message service controller for controlling short message processes of the second communication circuit the detailed functions and the operations of the controller will be described in the following and a central controlling device with a user interface i.e. a man machine interface for receiving a command wherein the user interface is shared by the first communication circuit and the controller i.e. in this embodiment the communication apparatus sets one user interface in the central controlling device . Accordingly in this embodiment the communication apparatus is a handheld communication device for example a mobile phone or a Personal Digital Assistant PDA .

In addition in the first communication circuit comprises a message service module such as a first short message service module and further comprises a system storage device wherein the first short message service module processes short message receiving sending operations corresponding to the first telecommunication network and the system storage device is a main storage device of the communication apparatus wherein the system storage device generally has a huge storage size and stores most short messages received by the communication apparatus . The second communication circuit comprises a message service module such as a second short message service module for processing short message receiving sending operations corresponding to the second telecommunication network . In this embodiment the controller comprises an initialization module for triggering an initialization procedure to validate detect a usable short message storage capacity of the second subscriber identity module card corresponding to the second communication circuit a short message management module for managing reading writing copying moving and deleting operations of the short messages as in the initialization procedure where the short message management module reads the short message from the second subscriber identity module according to the usable short message storage capacity detected in the initialization procedure and stores the short message into the system storage device a message transmission module such as a short message sending module for reading a target short message service center information received by a system configuration file of a target short message service center according to a subscriber configuration file of a target short message service center and then controlling the second communication circuit to send a target short message according to the target short message service center information and a short message receiving module for controlling whether the short message receiving module stores the target short message into the system storage device or not according to at least one of the target short messages received by the second communication circuit and a data storing state of the system storage device . Please note that architectures and principles of the aforementioned devices and are well known in the art and therefore not explained in detail here for the sake of brevity.

It should be noted that in when detecting that testing time of Step is not greater than M flow goes back to Step . In this situation the initialization module will re examine whether or not the second short message service module starts up successfully. However in other implementations when detecting that testing time of Step is not greater than M then flow directly goes back to Step and does not need to re examine whether or not the second short message service module starts up successfully. In addition the procedure of detecting whether or not the second short message service module starts up successfully and the procedure of detecting whether or not the first short message service module and the system storage device start up successfully are not limited to follow the exact order shown in . In other implementations the initialization module can firstly detect whether or not the first short message service module and the system storage device start up successfully and later detect whether or not the second short message service module starts up successfully.

Please refer to . illustrates a flow performing the following steps according to a calculation result in Step as shown in . First in Step the short message management module reads an existing short message from the second subscriber identity module card according to usable short message storage capacity of the second subscriber identity module card . In Step the short message management module detects whether items of read short messages are greater than the usable short message storage capacity of the second subscriber identity module card or the total amount of existing short messages in the second subscriber identity module card . If the detection result is true then flow will enter flow as shown in . In Step the controller detects whether or not the short message management module reads the short message successfully. Regardless of whether the short message management module reads the short message successfully or not the controller will inform the user interface to continuously read the next short message in the second subscriber identity module card Step . As a result flow goes back to Step to perform iteratively until items of read short messages are greater than the usable short message storage capacity of the second subscriber identity module card or the total amount of existing short messages in the second subscriber identity module card . In this embodiment the short message management module utilizes a one by one approach of reading short messages to read the existing short messages in the second subscriber identity module card i.e. after the short message management module has read one short message the short message management module should wait for information of the user interface to continuously read a next short message in the second subscriber identity module card . As a result losing a short message due to the short message not being stored into system storage device in real time can be avoided.

Please refer to . Flow should be activated after the short message management module completes operations of reading the short message in second subscriber identity module card as shown In . First the initialization module detects data storage states of the system storage device and alternatively informs a predetermined short message service center corresponding to the second subscriber identity module card according to the data storage states in Step . For example if a storage capacity of the system storage device is not full then the initialization module may inform the predetermined short message service center that the system storage device can still be utilized to store new short messages. The predetermined short message service center clearly decides whether the new short messages or the prior short messages received unsuccessfully by the second communication circuit are transmitted into the communication apparatus . The initialization module will inform the user interface to renew the short message interface displaying configuration file such as short message title date short message sender s name and etc. As a result the user interface clearly displays received current information to users Step . In addition in Step the short message management module reads at least a system configuration file of the short message service center from the second subscriber identity module card . For example the system configuration file of the short message service center comprises address data of all usable short message service centers currently. In Step the short message management module reads at least a subscriber configuration file of the short message service center from the second subscriber identity module card . For instance the subscriber configuration file of the short message service center records which short message service center is utilized by the user. Finally controller finishes and completes all initialization procedures.

Please refer to . is a flow chart of sending short messages through the controller for the communication apparatus shown in . In this flow the short message sending module reads a target short message service center information recorded by a system configuration file of a target short message service center according to a plurality of subscriber configuration files of a short message service center Step i.e. the short message sending module reads the short message service center utilized by the second short message service module during sending of the short message according to a user setting in the subscriber configuration files of a short message service center. In Step the controller sends a transmission request to the second subscriber identity module card then the short message sending module controls the second communication circuit to send a target short message according to the target short message service center information Step and flow ends.

Please refer to . is a flow chart of receiving short messages through the controller for the communication apparatus shown in . When the second short message service module of the second communication circuit receives any short messages from the second telecommunication network the second short message service module will inform the controller . In flow the short message receiving module of the controller receives a target short message from the second subscriber identity module card Step . Then in Step the short message receiving module determines what type the target short message is. For example the target short message may simply be a system acknowledgement message so the target short message is only displayed and need not be stored. In addition some short messages need to be stored into storage devices for users to access and read for example the system storage device the first subscriber identity module card or the second subscriber identity module card . It should be noted that in this embodiment the communication apparatus stores all short messages received by the first telecommunication network and the second telecommunication network into the system storage device in advance for avoiding storing data iteratively however this is only one implementation and does not meant to limit the scope of the present invention. As a result in Step the short message receiving module detects whether or not the target short message is stored. If the target short message is not stored then the short message receiving module sends an acknowledgment to the aforementioned short message service center via the second short message service module for informing that the aforementioned target short message has been received successfully Step . In Step the short message receiving module informs the user interface to receive the aforementioned target short message and flow ends. On the other hand if the aforementioned target short message is stored then in Step the short message receiving module detects whether or not there is a usable data storage capacity in the system storage device . If there is a usable data storage capacity in the system storage device then in Step the target short message will be stored into the system storage device . In Step the short message receiving module sends an acknowledgement to the aforementioned short message service center via the second short message service module for informing that the aforementioned target short message has been received successfully. In addition in Step the short message receiving module informs the user interface to receive the aforementioned target short message and flow ends. If there is no usable data storage capacity in the system storage device then in Step the short message receiving module sends a negative acknowledgement to the aforementioned short message service center via the second short message service module for informing that the aforementioned target short message has not been received successfully. In addition the short message receiving module informs the user interface that there is no usable storage capacity to receive the aforementioned target short message in Step and flow ends.

Please refer to . is a flow chart of reading short messages through the controller for the communication apparatus shown in . In this flow the short message management module detects whether or not a reading procedure is a startup reading in Step . If the reading procedure is the startup reading then the short message management module performs the above mentioned related steps shown in for reading data. If the reading procedure is not the startup reading then the short message management module detects whether or not the reading procedure is a copy reading in Step . If the reading procedure is a copy reading i.e. the reading procedure performs an operation of data copy then the short message management module performs steps following flow as shown in . If the reading procedure is not a copy reading then in Step the short message management module sends a general reading request to the second subscriber identity module card and in Step the short message management module receives the needed short message from the second subscriber identity module card and flow ends.

Please refer to . is a flow chart of writing short messages through the controller for the communication apparatus shown in . In this flow in Step the short message management module performs a writing procedure according to the usable storage capacity of the second subscriber identity module card in the above mentioned initialization procedure. In Step the short message management module sends a writing request to the second subscriber identity module card for writing a target short message into the second subscriber identity module card and flow ends.

Please refer to . is a flow chart of copying or moving short messages through the controller for the communication apparatus shown in . In this flow in Step the short message management module detects whether the controller performs operations for copying or moving short messages from the first subscriber identity module card or the system storage device to the second subscriber identity module card . If the detection result is true then in Step the short message management module requests the first communication circuit via an application programming interface API not shown in to read a target short message of the first subscriber identity module card or the system storage device . Next in Step the short message management module detects whether or not there is a usable storage capacity in the second subscriber identity module card . If there is a usable storage capacity in the second subscriber identity module card then in Step the short message management module performs the aforementioned writing procedure in flow shown in . If the operation performed by the short message management module is moving the short message Step then in Step the short message management module further requests the first communication circuit via an API to delete the said short message and in Step the short message management module informs the user interface that the said short message is moved successfully. On the other hand if the operation performed by the short message management module is copying the short message Step then in Step the short message management module informs the user interface that the said short message is copied successfully. Accordingly if Step fails then in Step the short message management module informs the user interface that the said short message is copied or moved unsuccessfully.

If the short message management module does not detect the aforementioned needed operations for copying or moving short messages from the first subscriber identity module card or the system storage device to the second subscriber identity module card in Step then flow will execute Step . In this situation the short message management module detects whether or not the controller needs to perform operations of copying or moving short messages from the second subscriber identity module card to the first subscriber identity module card or the system storage device . If the detection result is positive then flow performs Step otherwise flow performs Step and flow ends. In Step the short message management module reads the said target short message from the second subscriber identity module card . In Step the short message management module requests the first communication circuit to detect whether there is a usable storage capacity in the first subscriber identity module card or in the system storage device . If Step fails then flow jumps to Step and flow ends. Contrarily if Step is true then in Step the short message management module further requests the first communication circuit via the API to write the aforementioned target short message into the first subscriber identity module card or in the system storage device . In addition if the operation performed by the short message management module is moving the short message Step then in Step the controller controls the second communication circuit to delete the aforementioned target short message from the second subscriber identity module card and in Step the short message management module informs the user interface that the aforementioned target short message is moved successfully. If the operation performed by the short message management module is copying the short message Step then in Step the short message management module informs the user interface that the aforementioned target short message is copied successfully.

Please refer to . is a flow chart of copying or moving short messages through the controller for the communication apparatus shown in . In this flow in Step the short message management module receives a command in which the short message management module deletes one or more target short messages from the second subscriber identity module card sent by a user via the user interface . In Step the short message management module sends a deletion request to the second subscriber identity module card . Accordingly in Step the short message management module detects whether or not there is a needed target short message for deletion in the second subscriber identity module card . If Step is true then flow repeats the Step until the target short message corresponding to the deletion request is completely deleted from the second subscriber identity module card . If the short message management module detects there is no needed target short message for deletion in the second subscriber identity module card i.e. Step fails then in Step the short message management module informs the user interface that the aforementioned target short message corresponding to the deletion request is deleted successfully and flow ends.

The communication apparatus of the present invention is a handheld communication device such as a mobile phone or Personal Digital Assistant PDA wherein in the above mentioned embodiment the first telecommunication network and the second telecommunication network correspond to the same telecommunication standard. For example the telecommunication standard complies with a Global System for Mobile Communications GSM standard. However in the present invention the first telecommunication network and the second telecommunication network are respectively a GSM standard and a Personal Handyphone System PHS standard.

In one implementation of the present invention the first communication circuit and the controller are disposed on the same circuit board and the second communication circuit is disposed on another circuit board. In another implementation the first communication circuit is disposed on a circuit board and the second communication circuit and the controller are both disposed on another circuit board. In addition the two aforementioned circuit boards are disposed in parallel in the housing of the communication apparatus according to a specific order or not and the connection between the aforementioned circuit boards is through a transmission interface for transmitting control signals and data.

The aforementioned transmission interface in communication apparatus of the present invention may be implemented using the prior art architecture. For example the aforementioned transmission interface utilizes an AT command format to send control commands for controlling processes of the short message and transmission of the short message data utilizes a binary format. As a result transmitting a command between the controller and the second communication circuit performs respective operations about AT command translation on two sites controller and second communication circuit however data are allowed to be directly transmitted between the controller and the second communication circuit according to the binary format without any format translation. Accordingly in another embodiment of the present invention the aforementioned transmission interface may directly utilize an AT command format to send a control command for controlling processes of the short message and performing the transmission of the short message data. For example the telecommunication standard of the first telecommunication network is a GSM standard or PHS standard and the telecommunication standard of the second telecommunication network is a GSM standard or PHS standard. When a controlling command of the short message needs to be transmitted between the controller and the second communication circuit then the controlling command needs to perform respective operations about AT command translation on two sites. As a result a data transmission between the controller and the second communication circuit needs to perform respective operations about AT command translation on two sites. In another embodiment of the communication apparatus of the present invention the aforementioned transmission interface may directly utilize a binary format to send a control command for controlling processes of the short message and performing the transmission of the short message data. For example the telecommunication standard of the first telecommunication network is a GSM standard or PHS standard and the telecommunication standard of the second telecommunication network is a GSM standard or PHS standard. When a controlling command of the short message needs to be transmitted between the controller and the second communication circuit then the controlling command is transmitted through the binary format without any format translation needed. Similarly as the binary format is employed the data are allowed to be directly transmitted between the controller and the second communication circuit without any format translation needed.
