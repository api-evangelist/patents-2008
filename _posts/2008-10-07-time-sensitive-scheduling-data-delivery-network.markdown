The present invention can be implemented in various different forms including but not limited to business processes computer implemented methods computer program products computer systems and communication networks entity interfaces application programming interfaces and the like.

The communications network may include simple devices advanced devices individual access devices and community access devices.

The simple device may be a low end price competitive device that receives TSSD. It may be able to send a Yes No indicator in response to something on the device screen. The simple device may also receive TSSD based on who the entity is and or what the interest profile is of the entity.

The aforementioned advanced device may have all the capabilities of the simple device plus some additional communications capabilities. By way of example such a device may have a full two way interactive device. Some of its features may include a larger screen and easy manipulation of on screen information. The advanced device may come in various sizes and shapes and changes where people may go to get critical information at several points during their day. The embedded systems devices may include cellular phones PDAs mobile digital assistants with cellular phones text messaging devices and PDAs and Java MIDP mobile information device profile enabled devices multifunction wristwatches and handheld computing devices.

Individual access devices such as the laptop computer desk top computer cellular phone and PDA may allow a single entity to receive TSSD into a reception zone often in a web browser format. These individual access devices typically already have web browser capability built in. One of the access devices in this category is a web browser with a special web interface that is designed to receive TSSD. This mimics the advanced device functions somewhat except as a web application. Another access device is a cellular phone using the web interface that is now available in many mid to high end cellular phones. Another access device is a PDA using the internet interface that is available now in cellular or Wi Fi connected PDA devices. Other embedded systems devices can use non web integration.

The community access devices may allow multiple entities to receive TSSD into a reception zone often in a web browser type format. One of the access devices in this category may be a set top box for example. The set top box may use the web interface and keyboards that are available with some set top box vendors. This is typically the in home TV access to TSSD. Another reception zone is a kiosk. This is typically activity data shown in a communal or public area. Vertical kiosk applications come out of this area with payment structures such as from a sponsor paying to the public entity paying. In some parts of the world this is a substitute for a local or regional newspaper or a way to check on government services without a long wait in lines. A third community reception zone is a broadcast channel which may allow the entity to receive TSSD into a reception zone on a broadcast media channel the entity is watching. These are zones of traveling message data strips on cable channels or more standalone captive areas like airport system screens. The scrolling TSSD seen there is based on location and the business function at that location. The media types for these streams are varied and include internet protocol telephony and both on air cable and private cable.

In a pure push system content may be streamed to an entity as determined by the providing entity. The entity has the option of consuming i.e. viewing listening or feeling the content or ignoring the content. In one modified push system the entity may have the option to block filter unwanted content and the providing entity can not override the consuming entity s choice not to receive specific types of content.

In a pure pull system an entity requests specific available content and the content is streamed to the entity s receiving device for consuming i.e. viewing listening or feeling . In one modified pull system the entity may request a category of content or specific content but the providing entity has the option to target specific consumers and thereby filter what is streamed to an entity. The entity cannot override the providing entity s choice not to stream content to the specific entity.

In the TSSD delivery network the types of data collected from providing entities may include meeting information event information and volunteer opportunity information. Based on this type of collected data public alerts free public service announcements paid promotions and paid advertising can be targeted effectively.

In an embodiment of the invention private TSSD may be activity content provided by the ultimate consumer of the TSSD for that consumer s private use. There may not be an intent for this information to be shared with other entities with the possible exception of family members i.e. pushed on TSSD channels. When an entity is streamed their private TSSD no filtering need be applied.

In an embodiment of the invention public TSSD may be activity content provided with the intent of this content being consumed i.e. viewed heard or felt by affiliated or subscribed entities. The intent may be to inform others by providing this content for distribution to affiliated entities.

In another embodiment a privacy circle may be a set of one or more entities designated by a private TSSD provider to be treated as a proxy or the same as the entity providing the private TSSD content. Thus entities of a privacy circle inherit the same attributes and a status as the TSSD providing entity with regards to the specific channel in which that private TSSD is streaming.

The TSSD delivery network can contain within it very valuable data for which advertisers and marketers may pay premium amounts. The TSSD delivery network is rich in information because it may categorize the data automatically along at least three dimensions profile behavior and responses.

In one embodiment the first dimension may be profiles. All entities may create TSSD having profiles rich in information about what they do via their associations including their derived interests hobbies expertise and similar activities. Entities may include individuals members of organizations and organizations. The TSSD communications network based passive delivery method characterizes that information across the TSSD delivery network for advertisers.

According to another embodiment the second dimension may be behavior. Behavior may include an entity s choice of affiliation. Timely up to date information can be implied from entity choices and actions within the TSSD delivery network. For example the entity that is a member of three organizations gives indicators to three or more major areas of interest because there are profiles on most entities within the TSSD delivery network which include their purpose and mission.

According to another embodiment the third dimension may be responses. Responding to the advertisements themselves may create additional TSSD for the TSSD delivery network. Valuable response information may then be captured in at least two ways. Many entities will be responding to event and meeting notices that tie them to an area of interest which can then be used in matching marketing data characteristics to advertisers. And similarly when an entity sees an advertiser s advertisement or message the entity can respond usually by going to a more detailed descriptive message. This action may create additional TSSD and a kind of meta characteristic of interest based on the non search criteria.

Given a set of characteristics that an advertiser wants to reach the TSSD communications network based passive delivery method may deliver the advertisement or message via the TSSD delivery network to a metro zone state region or to the entire TSSD delivery network but only to those individuals matching the advertisers characteristics for example.

The TSSD fulfillment process may allow promoters to provide subscribers with promotions or advertisements that fall for example specifically into their areas of interest. A sponsor or other advertisement placement buyer may pay for these services that result in promotional messages transmitted to hand held communications devices or other types of devices that have built in reception capability. This may allow sponsors of an organization to place advertisements for delivery within one association or across the entire TSSD delivery network.

In one embodiment the TSSD fulfillment process functions may include 1 obtaining a list of channels 2 selecting channels 3 sending device and entity identifiers and subscription request 4 storing authorization and decoding keys 5 requesting a TSSD channel stream and or 6 displaying a TSSD channel stream.

According to another embodiment the TSSD fulfillment process may involve both a modified push system in which content is sent to the entity and a modified pull system in which the entity requests the content details or opens a gateway to new TSSD content. At any given moment an entity may be receiving pushed content from one or more channels streams based on the list of channels which the entity has authorized i.e. chosen to monitor. In addition the same entity may be receiving pushed content which is sponsoring the chosen channel or content which is targeted at the channel.

In the TSSD fulfillment process the type of data collected from providing entities and streamed to consuming entities may be public or private. In the modified push system the public TSSD content may be filtered by for example TSSD profile category region purchased and jurisdiction purchased. The private data may be streamed unfiltered but targeted only to the entity or their designated privacy circle. In the modified pull system the requested private TSSD content detail may be returned to its entity or their designated privacy circle but may be blocked from streaming to any other requesting entity. In the modified pull system the requested public TSSD content detail may be returned if the requestor s profile or affiliation meets the targeting criteria of the public TSSD content providing entity.
