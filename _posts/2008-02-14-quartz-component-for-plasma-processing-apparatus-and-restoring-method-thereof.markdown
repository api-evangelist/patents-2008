This is a Division of application Ser. No. 10 790 188 filed Mar. 2 2004 now abandoned. The disclosure of the prior application is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. This invention was first described in Japanese Patent Application No. 2003 55620 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

This invention relates to a plasma processing technique for manufacturing semiconductor devices and particularly to a quartz component employed in plasma processing apparatus. This invention also relates to a method for restoring the quartz component.

Plasma processes such as dry etching are widely employed in manufacturing semiconductor devices. For example etching is generally performed using a reactive gas activated by plasma. In dry etching techniques however components within the chamber of a plasma processing apparatus are often damaged due to their exposure to the plasma. In particular a dry etching apparatus for etching silicon oxide which requires high energy ions presents a serious problem in that it damages the components.

The plasma chamber components are generally formed of materials such as quartz anodized aluminum silicon silicon carbide carbon a fluorine polymer material various kinds of ceramic materials or the like. The selection of the material is made from the perspective of electric insulation workability impurity concentration and the like. However none of the aforementioned materials can completely eliminate the problem of plasma damage.

Accordingly the components of a plasma processing apparatus that suffer plasma damage are treated as expendables and are managed on the basis of a predetermined duration of use. That is the components that have reached the predetermined duration of use are replaced with new ones.

In the event that the user uses a plasma processing apparatus including the chamber components beyond their predetermined duration of use the damaged components may create a problem of for example unstable plasma discharge.

The chamber components are designed to generate a suitable current path. When the plasma damages any of chamber components new current paths are formed leading to the problem that a desired plasma discharge cannot be sustained. Furthermore the flow of reactive gas may be influenced due to the damage of the chamber components and unwanted particles may be generated from the damaged components.

Usually however the plasma does not damage the entirety of a chamber component but damages only a specific portion of the component. Accordingly replacement of the entire chamber component leads to unnecessarily high costs and to waste of resources.

Accordingly an arrangement is proposed that divides a component in a plurality of parts. In particular Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 10 265977 proposes to divide the shield ring which suffers from the most serious damage in the chamber components into an inside component and an outside component. The inside component is located at a position where the inside component particularly suffers from particle adhesion and damage due to sputtering. By constructing the inside component with a material highly resistible to particle adhesion and sputtering the lifetime and hence the cycle of replacement of the shield ring is extended.

However dividing a single component into multiple sub components increases the number of chamber components and leads to a problem of increased management costs.

This invention has been made according to various exemplary embodiments in order to address the above described problems and accordingly this invention provides a quartz component for a plasma processing apparatus and a restoring method which enables restoration of the chamber components and in particular that enables repeated use of the component without adversely influencing the plasma process.

In order to address the above described problems the present invention provides according to various exemplary embodiments 

A plate shaped quartz component for use in a plasma processing apparatus is disclosed wherein the plate shaped quartz component comprises an inner parameter a main surface extending outwardly from the inner parameter a first portion around the inner parameter the first portion having a flat first region on the main surface and a second portion adjacent to an outer parameter of the first portion having a smaller thickness than that of the first portion the second portion having a second region adjacent to the first region on the main surface the second region having a height lower than that of the first region.

A plasma processing apparatus is also disclosed which comprises a processing chamber to accommodate the workpiece an electrode within the process chamber to generate the plasma the electrode having an outer parameter and a plate shaped quartz component having an inner parameter that surrounds the outer parameter of the electrode.

Moreover a method of restoring the plate shaped quartz component used in a plasma processing apparatus is disclosed which comprises forming a bulge of quartz material on a first region of the main surface such that the main surface is divided into the first region and a second region adjacent to the first region by an offset and machining the main surface having the bulges such that a flat surface is formed in the first region while maintaining the offset. Also a method for manufacturing semiconductor devices is disclosed the method comprising mounting a plate shaped quartz component in the plasma processing apparatus processing a certain number of semiconductor wafers in the apparatus and restoring the quartz component that much by the exposure to the plasma.

Finally a method of using and restoring a plate shaped quartz component is disclosed the method comprising using the component in a plasma processing apparatus restoring the used component including forming a bulge of quartz material on a portion of the main surface and machining the main surface having the bulge such that the main surface becomes flat throughout the first region and the second region of the component reusing the restored component in the apparatus and re restoring the re reused component including forming a bulge of quartz material on the first region such that the main surface of the component is divided into a first region and a second region by an offset and machining the main surface having the bulge such that a flat surface is formed in the first region while maintaining the offset.

Thus use of the component over a long period of time is enabled by repeating the restoration process of the component damaged due to its use within the plasma processing apparatus thereby reducing the running costs of the plasma processing apparatus and improving the efficiency of utilization of resources.

These and other features and advantages of this invention are described in or are apparent from the following detailed description of various exemplary embodiments of the systems and methods according to this invention.

The processing chamber accommodates a silicon wafer W to be processed and a vacuum of around 10Torr 10Pa can be established. The chamber includes an upper electrode at the upper middle thereof and a lower electrode at the lower middle thereof. The upper electrode is connected to a gas inlet for introducing the etching gas. The lower electrode has an electrostatic chuck for mounting the wafer W which is to be etched.

The side surface of the outer perimeter of the lower electrode is coated with an anodized aluminum layer and covered by a fluorine polymer film or the like so as to ensure electric insulation of the lower electrode .

The upper electrode and the lower electrode are arranged parallel to each another. The surfaces of electrodes and which are facing one another are flat. Thus the electrodes form a parallel plate electrode configuration for generating plasma in a space between the upper and lower electrodes and by applying RF electric power.

The upper electrode further includes shower nozzles not shown for uniformly supplying etching gas to the space between the upper and lower electrodes. The etching gas is guided to the outer portion of the chamber and is evacuated at a controlled flow rate by an unshown pumping system. As a result etching gas atmosphere with a predetermined and constant pressure is produced in the space between the upper and lower electrodes.

Upon applying RF electric power to the etching gas atmosphere through the electrodes plasma is generated in the space between the upper electrode and the lower electrode . Thus RF plasma is generated within the chamber and dry etching can therefore be performed.

For supplying the RF power the plasma processing apparatus includes an RF power supply and an RF power splitter for supplying the RF electric power to both the upper electrode and the lower electrode . That is a split coupling configuration in which the RF power is supplied to both the upper and the lower electrodes is employed in the exemplary embodiment shown in . However other configurations such as anode coupling and cathode coupling may also be employed.

The perimeters of the upper electrode and the lower electrode are surrounded by upper quartz component and lower quartz component respectively. The upper quartz component serves as a shield ring and the lower quartz component serves as a focus ring both of which have the function of focusing the plasma between the parallel plate electrodes and . The shield ring and the focus ring are detachably mounted onto the chamber .

The lower surface of the shield ring and the upper surface of the focus ring respectively are generally the parts that are damaged due to exposure to the plasma. In particular the inner perimeter of the lower and upper surfaces which are positioned near the outer perimeter of the upper and lower electrodes and can be seriously damaged. Accordingly the lower surface of the shield ring and the upper face of the focus ring respectively are formed in a shape so as to facilitate their restoration.

Furthermore as shown in the shield ring and the focus ring are disposed such that the lower surface of the shield ring and the upper surface of the focus ring face one another so as to form a path for guiding the etching gas from the space between the upper and lower electrodes to the outer portion of the chamber . Accordingly the lower surface of the shield ring and the upper surface of the focus ring affect the flow of the etching gas. Therefore the lower surface of the shield ring and the upper surface of the focus ring are formed in a shape so as not to significantly disturb the flow of the etching gas.

The lower surface of the shield ring and the upper surface of the focus ring which are readily damaged due to exposure to the plasma and which may affect the flow of the etching gas will be referred to as main surfaces of the shield ring and of the focus ring hereafter.

Next description will be made regarding the focus ring according to an exemplary embodiment of this invention.

More specifically as shown in the focus ring includes a first portion around the inner perimeter and a second portion adjacent to the outer perimeter of the first region. The first portion has a flat surface first region A on the main surface and the second portion also has a flat surface second region A on the main surface.

The first region A which corresponds to the ridge has a larger height than that of the second region A and the difference is height d. In other words the main surface of the focus ring is divided into the first region A and the second region A by an offset d.

The height of the offset d is determined such that the restoration process can be easily performed when the focus ring becomes damaged due to exposure to the plasma after processing of a certain number of wafers W. At the same time the height of the offset d does not significantly disturb the flow of the processing gas supplied to the space between the electrodes.

On the other hand as shown in the side surface of the inner perimeter of the focus ring is formed perpendicular to the main surface. At the time of mounting the focus ring to the lower electrode so as to surround the outer perimeter of the lower electrode the side surface of the focus ring faces the side surface of the outer perimeter of the lower electrode . Thus a gap with a predetermined width is formed as shown in .

According to various exemplary embodiments the focus ring is formed such as to minimize the gap thereby preventing damage of the side surface of the lower electrode because of exposure to the plasma.

Furthermore the focus ring includes a stepped region A with a predetermined width within the region A on the inner perimeter side wherein the main surface of the region A is smaller than other portions on the region A. The region A is formed so as to facilitate mounting of the wafer W on the lower electrode .

The lower electrode is formed with a slightly smaller diameter than that of the wafer W and accordingly the outer perimeter of the wafer W mounted on the lower electrode extends outwardly from the lower electrode as shown in . The focus ring includes the region A with the height of the main surface lower than that of the other portions of the region A in order to prevent chipping of the wafer W.

That is as shown in the focus ring is mounted onto the lower electrode such that the height of the first region A of the focus ring becomes substantially flush with the surface of the wafer W mounted on the lower electrode . Therefore if the entire portion of the region A is formed to have the same height the outer perimeter of the wafer W will be pressed into contact with the main surface of the focus ring .

It should be noted that shows an exemplary arrangement of the focus ring in which the main surfaces of the regions A and A are formed with the same height. However the configuration of the focus ring is not limited to this exemplary arrangement.

The focus ring according to various exemplary embodiments has generally the same configuration and generally the same functions as a conventional focus ring. The difference is that the main surface of a conventional focus ring is not divided into a first region A and a second region A by an offset i.e. the entire main surface is formed flat except for the region A along the inner perimeter for mounting the wafer W.

The configuration of the focus ring where the main surface is divided into a first region A and a second region A by the offset d and where the first region A is made higher than the second region A enables repeated restorations of the focus ring as described below.

Specifically according to various exemplary embodiments the offset d is preferably formed with a height of about 0.1 mm to about 2 mm and is more preferably formed with a height of about 0.3 mm to about 1.7 mm. The offset d formed with a smaller height than the above described range may lead to difficulty in restoring the focus ring. On the other hand an offset d formed with a greater height than the above described range may disturb the flow of the etching gas leading to a problem of poor uniformity in the processing of wafers W.

It should be noted that shows the offset d in an illustration that does not faithfully reproduce correct proportions. In general the focus ring is formed with a thickness of 12 mm for example which is far larger than the offset d. Furthermore the entire upper surface main surface is formed with a diameter of about 300 mm for example which is much larger than the height of the offset. Accordingly while the focus ring has an offset d with a small height the focus ring has generally the shape of a plate with a substantially uniform thickness and has a generally flat main surface.

The main surface of the focus ring is preferably divided into the first region A and the second region A with a width ratio in the radial direction of about 1 0.3 to about 1 0.2. More specifically according to various exemplary embodiments in a case where the main surface has the sum of the width of A and the width of A equal to 75 mm the main surface is preferably divided into the region A with a width of about 25 to about 55 mm and the region A with a width of about 20 to about 50 mm.

The main surface having the region A with a smaller width than this range may disturb the flow of processing gas. On the other hand the main face having the region A with a greater width than this range may lead to a problem of increased restoration costs.

The focus ring includes a beveled portion on the lower surface along the inner perimeter. As shown in the beveled portion extends to a depth E from the inner perimeter and to a depth E from the lower surface and is slanted at an angle from the lower surface. The beveled portion is preferably formed with a depth E of about 1 to about 10 mm a depth E of about 3 to about 8 mm and an angle of about 20 to about 60 .

As shown in at the time of mounting the focus ring to the lower electrode the focus ring is fit to the lower electrode such that the side surface on the inner perimeter of the focus ring faces the side surface on the outer perimeter of the lower electrode with a small gap in between. According to various exemplary embodiments the focus ring has a beveled portion on the lower surface along the inner perimeter. Thereby mounting the focus ring to the lower electrode is facilitated. Thus the beveled portion of the focus ring does not damage the insulating coating formed on the side surface of the outer perimeter of the lower electrode at the time of mounting.

Furthermore as is explained below the beveled portion facilitates the restoration of the focus ring .

According to various exemplary embodiments the entire lower surface of the focus ring i.e. the surface opposite to the main surface is flat except for the beveled portion. Accordingly the first portion around the inner perimeter is formed with a larger thickness than that of the second portion around the outer perimeter of the first portion.

More specifically both the first region A and the second region A of the focus ring are made flat and parallel to the lower surface. That is each of the first region A and the second region A has a constant thickness.

When mounted onto the lower electrode as shown in the first region and the second region of the focus ring become parallel to the upper surface of the lower electrode and to the upper surface of the wafer W mounted onto the lower electrode .

Accordingly as also shown in the first region of the focus ring forms together with the lower surface of the shield ring a constant gap which does not disturb the flow of the processing gas.

It should be noted that the focus ring according to this invention is not limited to the configuration that the entire lower surface is formed flat and both the first region and the second region are formed flat and parallel to the lower surface. For example an arrangement may be made according to various exemplary embodiments where the lower surface of the focus ring is formed in various shapes corresponding to the plasma processing apparatus.

However it is generally preferable to make the first region and the second region flat and perpendicular to the lower surface and or to each other. Such configuration makes it easy to manufacture the focus ring.

In practice the focus ring is formed in a shape corresponding to the wafer W to be processed which may have for example an inclined surface. Accordingly the focus ring may not be formed with a complete concentric circular configuration. Thus while shows an example having the first region A with a constant width in practice the first region A may not be formed with a completely constant width.

Nonetheless the focus ring has a generally concentric circular configuration wherein the first region A is formed with a substantially constant width.

Next description will be made regarding the shield ring which is another exemplary embodiment of a quartz component according to this invention.

The shield ring is formed in the overall shape of a doughnut shaped plate having an inner perimeter and an outer perimeter similarly to the focus ring . Furthermore as shown in the lower surface of the shield ring serving as the main surface includes a ridge around the inner perimeter.

More specifically as shown in the shield ring includes a first portion around the inner perimeter and a second portion adjacent to the outer perimeter of the first portion. The first portion has a flat surface first region B on the main surface and the second portion also has a flat surface second region B on the main surface.

The first region B which corresponds to the ridge has a larger height than the second region B and the difference is height d. In other words the main surface of the shield ring is divided into the first region B and the second region B by an offset d.

Note that in the second region B is positioned on the upper side of the first region B. However the term height as used here means a height from the surface opposite to the main surface the upper surface in of the shield ring . Accordingly the second region B is formed with a smaller height than that of the first region B.

The shield ring according to an aspect of this invention has generally the same configuration and generally the same functions as a conventional shield ring. A difference is that the main surface of a conventional shield ring is not divided into a first region B and a second region B by an offset i.e. the entire main surface of a conventional shield ring is formed flat.

The configuration of the shield ring where the main surface is divided into a first region B and a second region B by an offset d with the first region B higher than the second region B enables repeated restorations of the shield ring without replacement.

The offset d is formed with a height such that restoration can be easily performed when the shied ring becomes damaged due to exposure to the plasma during processing of a number of wafers W. At the same time the height of the offset d does not disturb the flow of the processing gas supplied to the space between the electrodes.

Specifically the offset d is preferably formed with a height of about 0.1 mm to about 2 mm and is more preferably formed with a height of about 0.3 mm to about 1.7 mm. A smaller height of the offset d than this range may lead to difficulty in the restoration. On the other hand a greater height of the offset d than this range may disturb the flow of etching gas thus leading to a problem of poor uniformity during processing of the wafer W.

The main surface of the shield ring is preferably divided into the first region B and the aforementioned second region B with a width ratio in the radial direction of about 1 0.3 to about 1 2.0. More specifically in a case of the main surface where the sum of the width of the region B and the width of the region B is 75 mm the main surface is preferably divided into the region B with a width of about 25 to about 55 mm and the region B with a width of about 20 to about 50 mm.

The main surface having a region B with a smaller width than this range may disturb the flow of the processing gas. On the other hand the main surface having a region B with a greater width than this range may lead to a problem of increased restoration costs.

Furthermore the shield ring includes a ridge on the outer perimeter on the upper surface i.e. on the surface opposite to the main surface. As shown in the ridge fits the recessed portion on the inner wall of the upper side of the chamber for positioning the shield ring so as to surround the outer perimeter of the upper electrode . This ridge on the outer perimeter also exists in conventional shield rings and is not an essential component of this invention.

The entire surface on the upper side of the shield ring is formed generally flat except for the ridge on the outer perimeter. Accordingly the second portion around the outer perimeter of the first portion is formed with a smaller thickness than that of the first portion around the inner perimeter of the shield ring except where the outer perimeter has a the ridge on the upper side.

Also the upper surface of the shield ring may be formed in various shapes corresponding to the plasma processing apparatus.

It should be noted that while shows the offset d in proportion not to actual scale. The offset d is formed with a far smaller height compared to the entire size of the main surface lower face . Accordingly the shield ring is generally formed in the shape of a plate with a uniform thickness and has a generally flat main surface except for the outer perimeter having a ridge on the upper side in a similar way as with the focus ring .

In practice however the shield ring is not necessarily formed with a perfectly concentric circular configuration. Even in this case the shield ring is formed with a generally concentric circular configuration wherein the first region B is formed with a generally constant width.

A restoration method of quartz components according to various exemplary embodiments of this invention is described below.

Restoration of the focus ring is performed as follows. First quartz material is supplied to the portion that was damaged during processing of a number of wafers W. In other words the damaged portion of the focus ring is filled with quartz material step .

Specifically as shown in a portion on the upper surface main surface of the focus ring along the inner perimeter which is positioned near the outer perimeter of the lower electrode is severely damaged during its use in the plasma etching apparatus . In the first stage of the restoration quartz material is supplied to the severely damaged portion which becomes a grooved portion step .

The supplying method is not limited to any particular one. For example as shown in quartz material in the shape of a stick with a diameter of about 1 mm is heated and melted with an oxyhydrogen flame burner so as to supply melted drops of quartz to the severely damaged portion while visually inspecting the supplying process.

However the above described supply of quartz material to the severely damaged portion alone cannot ensure the dimensional precision necessary for re using the part in the plasma processing apparatus. Accordingly in various exemplary embodiments upon completion of the supply of quartz material to the severely damaged portion an excess amount of quartz material is supplied so as to form a bulge step . Thereafter the bulge is machined such that the excess quartz material is removed thereby restoring the focus ring with sufficient dimensional precision.

The bulge is formed at and around the damaged portion of the focus ring as shown in . Specifically the bulge is formed on the side surface of the inner perimeter and on the first region A of the upper surface . As a method for forming the bulge for example drops of melted quartz material are supplied in the same way as the method of supply of the quartz material to the severely damaged portion during step .

The bulge is formed on the first region A of the upper surface of the focus ring so that the height of the first region A becomes somewhat higher by a thickness d than the required final height as shown in . The thickness d is determined so as to enable restoration of the first region A with high repeatability by machining while not requiring an excessive amount of material and processing.

Specifically in various exemplary embodiments the bulge is preferably formed with a thickness d of about 0.3 to about 3.0 mm. A bulge with a thickness d smaller than this range may lead to difficulty in machining. A bulge with a thickness d greater than this range may lead to a problem of excessive restoration costs.

It is to be noted that the focus ring includes the beveled portion along the inner perimeter of the lower surface. Accordingly the focus ring has the advantage of preventing quartz material from flowing onto the lower surface at the time of forming the bulge of quartz as schematically shown in . Thus there is generally no need for machining the lower surface.

Upon completion of the formation of the bulge the focus ring is annealed in order to reduce thermal distortion step . Subsequently machining is performed whereby restoration of the first region A is completed step .

That is the upper surface of the first region A is machined by grinding so as to form a flat surface. At the same time the height of the first region A is adjusted to a required height which is higher that that of the second region A. It is to be noted that during the grinding of the first region A the second region A is not grinded because it has a lower height than that of the first region A.

The side surface at the inner perimeter is also grinded so as to be perpendicular to the upper surface while adjusting the diameter of the inner perimeter to a predetermined value. Moreover the beveled portion is grinded in a predetermined shape. Furthermore the edge at the inner perimeter on the upper surface of the focus ring is grinded such that the region A has a smaller height than that of the other portions of the region A.

Thus restoration of the focus ring having the longitudinal cross sectional configuration shown in is complete.

As described above during the formation of the bulge the beveled portion on the lower surface prevents the quartz material from flowing onto the lower surface. Thus there is no need for machining the lower surface. Even in the event that a small protrusion is formed downwardly beyond the lower surface due to a poor control of the process of forming the bulge the protrusion can be removed during the grinding of the beveled portion.

Because there is no need to grind the lower surface and because the second region A of the upper surface is not grinded during the grinding of the first region A undue reduction of the height of the second region A during the restoration procedure is prevented. As will be explained later repeated restorations of the focus ring are enabled because the height of the second region A is not reduced.

According to various exemplary embodiments the quartz material is supplied to the damaged portion and on the first region A of the focus ring to form a bulge of the quartz material . Subsequently the focus ring is machined by grinding to restore the configuration where the first region A has a predetermined height which is larger than that of the second region A.

Thereby use of the focus ring for an extremely long time is enabled. That is the focus ring may be used for a long time except in cases where the focus ring breaks because of other factors.

Thus according to various exemplary embodiments the number of in stock replacement components required for multiple operation of a plasma processing apparatus can be reduced. As a result reduction of the production costs and a more effective utilization of resources are enabled.

Conventionally restoring was never performed for focus rings which suffer serious damage during their use in a plasma processing apparatus. Furthermore prior attempts to restore a conventional focus ring with a flat main surface i.e. with a configuration where the main surface is not divided into the first region A and the second region A by an offset were not successful. That is the number of times that the restoration can be repeated is limited to a very small number.

While description has been made for the restoration of the focus ring the shield ring may be restored in a similar fashion.

Furthermore description has been made for restoring a quartz component that initially has a configuration where the main surface is divided into an inner region with a larger height than an outer region by an offset. However it is also possible to restore a conventional quartz component. That is a conventional quartz component having a generally flat upper surface may be subjected to this restoration method so as to be re constructed as a focus ring with the configuration that the main surface is divided into an inner region with a larger height than an outer region by an offset as described in the next exemplary embodiment.

Next description will be made regarding a method for performing a cycle of use and restoration of a quartz component according to various exemplary embodiments of this invention.

According to various exemplary embodiments the first time a conventional focus ring having a generally flat upper surface main surface is used. After processing a number of wafers W a first time restoration is performed on the focus ring such that the upper surface becomes flat for its use a second time.

After processing a number of wafers W a second restoration is performed. This time restoration is performed so that the focus ring is formed with a configuration where the upper surface is divided into two regions by an offset as shown in .

Then the focus ring is used again. After being used on a number of wafers W a third restoration of the focus ring is performed in a configuration where the upper surface divided by an offset is maintained as in the case of the exemplary embodiment shown in . Subsequently the focus ring is repeatedly used and restored until the damaged focus ring cannot be restored any more.

At first the focus ring having a uniform and flat upper surface without an offset except for the region A at the edge along the inner perimeter and formed in a cross sectional shape as shown in is mounted for use in the plasma processing apparatus step . The plasma processing apparatus with the focus ring performs processing of a number of wafers W step . Some portions of the upper surface along the inner perimeter of the focus ring are damaged as shown in during processing of the wafers W.

Then melted quartz material is supplied to the severely damaged portion or the grooved portion as shown in step . Furthermore an excessive amount of quartz material is supplied to the severely damaged portion and to the upper surface and to the side surface of the focus ring so as to form a bulge around the severely damaged portion as shown in step .

Subsequently the focus ring is annealed step so as to reduce thermal distortion occurring at the time of forming the bulge . Then the bulged portion of the focus ring is machined by grinding step . Thereby restoring of the focus ring to a shape generally the same as a new one with the uniform and flat upper surface without any offset as shown in is completed.

During this step the entire upper surface of the focus ring is grinded uniformly so as to form a flat upper surface. Accordingly the thickness of the focus ring is reduced by about 0.1 to about 0.3 mm over the entire surface. In this state the quartz material fills the grooved portion of the restored focus ring as shown in .

Next the focus ring thus restored is mounted onto the plasma processing apparatus step and processing of another number of wafers W is performed in the same way step .

When the number of processed wafers W again reaches a certain number the focus ring is inspected to determine whether or not it can be restored step . Determination is made that the focus ring can be restored if it has not suffered fatal damage such as chipping cracking deformation or the like and can be restored by supplying quartz material to the damaged portion. On the other hand determination is made that the focus ring cannot be restored if it is fatally damaged and cannot be restored by simply supplying quartz material to the damaged portion.

In the event that determination is made that the focus ring can be restored melted quartz material is then supplied to the grooved portion shown in in the same way as described above step . Furthermore the quartz material is further supplied to the upper surface and to the side surface of the inner perimeter such that a bulge is formed as shown in step .

In this case unlike the first restoration shown in the bulge is formed not only around the grooved portion but also over the first region A with a predetermined width around the inner perimeter of the upper surface . Note that the bulge is not formed over the entire upper surface but is formed on a region with a predetermined width whereby the upper surface is divided into the first region A where the bulge is formed and the second region A where a bulge is not formed.

Next the focus ring is annealed so as to reduce thermal distortion step . Then the bulge formed on the first region A of the upper surface of the focus ring is machined by grinding step .

During this step grinding is performed while maintaining the height of the first region A higher than the height of the second region A by an offset. Thereby restoration of the focus ring is completed with a configuration where the upper surface is divided into the first region A with a larger height and the second region A with a smaller height as shown in .

That is grinding is stopped when the configuration where the upper surface is divided into the first region A and the second region A separated in height by an offset is achieved. Therefore reduction of the height of the second region A due to grinding is prevented.

During the first restoration steps through the entire upper surface of the focus ring is grinded leading to reduction of the thickness of the focus ring over the entire surface as described above. Accordingly by performing the grinding such that the height of the first region A matches the height of the upper surface of the new one i.e. the thickness of the focus ring before the first use the focus ring can be restored to the configuration where the height of the first region A is larger than the height of the second region A by an offset.

Subsequently the restored focus ring is mounted onto the plasma processing apparatus step . Processing of a number of wafers W is performed steps until the number of processed wafers W reaches a certain number and the focus ring is damaged again as shown in .

If the determination is made during the inspection step that the focus ring can be restored quartz material is supplied to the damaged portion and a bulge is formed on the upper surface of the first region A and on the side surface of the inner perimeter steps and as shown in . After annealing step the bulge is grinded to restore the focus ring to the configuration where the upper surface is divided into two regions separated in height by an offset step as shown in .

Then the cycle of use and restoration is further repeated. That is following the third restoration the same cycle as the one of step through step shown in through is repeated.

On the other hand if the determination is made during step that the focus ring cannot be restored then the focus ring is discarded step . In this case a new focus ring is mounted onto the plasma processing apparatus step and the same cycle following step is performed.

As described above the repeated use of the quartz component according to the flow shown in utilizes two types of restoration methods. In the first restoration method step through step the bulge is formed around the severely damaged region grooved region and the entire upper surface is machined to be flat as shown in . In this first method the thickness of the focus ring is reduced.

In the second restoration method step through step on the other hand the bulge is formed on the first region A and is machined while maintaining a height offset between the first region A and the second region A as shown in or in . In the second method the second region A is not machined and the thickness of the focus ring is not reduced.

That is the first time the focus ring having a uniform and flat upper surface over the first region and the second region without offsets except for the region A at the edge along the inner perimeter is mounted onto the plasma processing apparatus. Following processing of a number of wafers W the damaged focus ring is restored by the first restoration method. Due to the restoration by the first method the thickness of the focus ring is reduced over the entire surface i.e. regions A and A.

The focus ring restored by the first method is mounted onto the plasma processing apparatus for a second cycle of use. Following the second cycle of use the damaged focus ring is restored by the second method. As a result the focus ring is restored with a configuration where the upper surface is divided in two regions separated in height by an offset.

The focus ring restored after the second cycle of use is mounted onto the plasma processing apparatus for a third cycle of use. Subsequently restoration of the focus ring by the second method while maintaining the height offset formed during the second restoration and use of the restored focus ring are repeated.

According to various exemplary embodiments at first a focus ring having a uniform and flat upper surface without any height offsets is used. Thereby the initial purchase cost of the focus ring is reduced compared with the case where a focus ring with the upper surface divided by an offset is purchased. Furthermore because the first time restoration is performed simply by grinding the entire upper surface the restoration cost is also reduced.

The number of times that the restoration by the first method which leads to the reduction of thickness the focus ring over the entire surface can be performed is not necessarily limited to one. However the number of times is generally small.

When the reduction of thickness of the focus ring reaches a certain value due to the repetition of the restoration by the first method the side surface of the lower electrode becomes exposed. As a result the insulating coating on the side surface of the lower electrode may become damaged leading to an abnormal plasma discharge.

In addition reduction of the thickness over the entire surface leads to a change in the flow of etching gas leading to degradation in processing performance. Furthermore the reduction of the thickness decreases the mechanical strength of the focus ring itself.

In some cases however restoration by the first method can be performed multiple times depending on the configuration of the plasma processing apparatus and the shape of the focus ring. That is for example the reduction of the thickness of the focus ring obtained by performing the restoration by the first method only once may be too small. Such insufficient reduction of thickness may lead to an insufficient height of the offset between the first region A and the second region A and to inadvertent grinding of the second region during the grinding of the bulge formed on the first region.

It is possible to grind the first region A without grinding the second region A even if the height of the offset is made as small as about 0.1 mm and even if a specialized jig is not used. However the height of the offset of about 0.3 mm or more provides a sufficient margin for the efficient grinding of the first region A without grinding the second region A.

In order to prevent such inadvertent grinding of the second region A from happening the restoration by the first method is repeated multiple times until the reduction of the thickness reaches a predetermined value. Thereafter the restoration by the second method that forms the offset can be performed without the inadvertent grinding of the second region A.

In practice however the number of times the restoration by the first method can be performed is limited to two or three.

After the thickness of the focus ring is sufficiently reduced by performing the restoration by the first method one or more times on the other hand further restoration is made by the second restoration method without reducing the thickness of the focus ring. Thus use of the focus ring with the repeated restoration is enabled for a long time.

That is in the first region a bulge is formed and grinded to maintain a predetermined thickness the thickness of a new ring . Thus it is possible to prevent the upper electrode from suffering damage. Furthermore the second restoration method does not reduce the thickness of the second region. Thus changes in the flow of processing gas and deterioration of mechanical strength of the focus ring are prevented.

Note that the second region is not exposed to high density plasma and therefore is not significantly damaged during the use of the ring in the plasma processing apparatus. Accordingly if the restoration is made without grinding the second region the height of the second region is maintained even if the use and restoration cycles are repeated.

In practice the cycle where a single focus ring is used and restored as shown in is not performed but two focus rings are used in turn. That is a restored or new focus ring is used in the plasma processing apparatus during restoration of the damaged focus ring thereby enabling a continuous operation of the plasma processing apparatus.

A description has been made of an example where at first a conventional quartz component having a uniform and flat upper face is used and is then restored so as to have a configuration where the upper surface of the quartz component is divided in two regions and separated in height by an offset. However an arrangement may be made where a quartz component having a configuration where the upper surface is divided in two regions separated in height by an offset at the very first stage. In this case steps through shown in through are repeated.

Description will be made below with reference to the drawings regarding the operation of an exemplary plasma processing apparatus according to this invention. The same plasma processing apparatus as shown in is used.

In this example split coupling method for applying RF electric power to both the upper and lower electrodes was employed. In this example as shown in and quartz components focus ring and shield ring each having a main surface with a ridge in the shape of a circle are used.

The first region or the ridged region was formed with a width of 35 mm around the inner perimeter and the main surface was divided into the first region and the second region separated in height by an offset with a height of 1 mm. Furthermore a beveled portion of 2R is formed on the inner perimeter of the mounting surface lower face of the focus ring. Dry etching is performed for a silicon dioxide film using the plasma processing apparatus shown in .

Next the quartz components are restored. Here the shield ring and the focus ring both of which had been used for an accumulated RF discharge time of 300 hours are restored.

Following removal of foreign material adhered onto the shield ring and the focus ring bulges of quartz material are formed on the first region of the main surface the lower surface of the shield ring and the upper surface of the focus ring and on the side surface of the inner perimeter. After the components were annealed grinding is performed to restore the shied ring and the focus ring .

Here grinding is not performed for the second region on the outer side of the main surface thereby enabling the second region to remain unchanged.

Next the restored shield ring and the focus ring are again mounted in the plasma processing apparatus . Etching characteristics were measured using the wafer W with the same cross sectional configuration as shown in and under the same etching conditions as shown in Table 1. The results are shown in Table 2 as well.

The change in the etching characteristics due to the restoration of the quartz components the shield ring and the focus ring were found to be within an acceptable range of variation during normal processing which is a level that does not present any problems during the production of semiconductor devices. Furthermore it is confirmed that the plasma processing using the restored quartz components does not present a problem of unwanted particle generation.

According to this example the ridges were formed on the main surfaces of the shield ring and focus ring as follows. That is as shown in a bulge of quartz material was formed on the region first region on the flat main surface around the inner perimeter such that the main surface is divided into the first region and the second region separated in height by an offset. Then grinding is performed so as to maintain the offset whereby formation of the ridge on the main surface is completed.

The first region is intended to be formed with a uniform width. Because the bulge is formed by manual work however the width of the first region has relatively large irregularities of around 1 to around 2 mm.

That is the first region is not formed with exactly a uniform width. However even in this case the plasma processing using the restored shield ring and focus ring exhibited excellent etching characteristics comparable to plasma processing using a conventional shield ring and a focus ring having flat main surfaces.

While description has been made regarding an example of quartz components subjected to restoration only once even in the event where restoration of the components is repeated multiple times the restored quartz components present the same advantages. That is for example the restored focus ring prevents abnormal discharge due to exposure of the side surface of the lower electrode to plasma. Therefore repeated restoration and use of the quartz components for a long time is enabled.

While description has been made regarding an example of the focus ring having a beveled portion of 2R on the mounting surface the shape of the beveled portion is not limited to this example. Rather an arrangement may be made with beveled portions of various shapes as long as the beveled portions expand the opening for facilitating the mounting of the focus ring onto the lower electrode without damaging the insulating coating.

Next description will be made regarding a comparative example to facilitate understanding of some advantages of this invention. The plasma processing apparatus shown in was also used for this comparative example.

Conventional shield ring and focus ring having uniform and flat main surfaces were mounted in the plasma processing apparatus and reactive plasma was generated so as to process wafers W. The wafer W had the same configuration as shown in . The same conditions for generating plasma as shown in the Table 1 were employed as well.

For the shield ring corrosion occurred on the side surface of the inner perimeter in the horizontal direction. The maximum amount of corrosion i was measured as shown in . In this case corrosion occurred at a rate of 35 nm min.

For the focus ring corrosion occurred at a portion near the inner perimeter of the upper surface in a direction perpendicular to the upper surface as shown in . That is the corrosion occurred at a region that is exposed to the plasma during processing of the wafer W and that surrounds the lower electrode and the outer perimeter of the wafer W mounted on the lower electrode. In this case corrosion of the focus ring occurred in a perpendicular direction at the rate of 55 nm min.

A maximum acceptable amount of corrosion of the shield ring is about 1 mm in the horizontal direction. A shield ring damaged beyond this amount of corrosion causes particle generation during plasma processing. Accordingly the duration of use of the shield ring is reduced to around 450 to 500 hours.

On the other hand a maximum acceptable amount of corrosion of the focus ring is about 1 mm in the vertical direction. The corrosion of the focus ring occurs in the shape of a circular groove so that the remaining quartz forms a bank around the inner perimeter.

The corrosion of the shield ring beyond this maximum amount leads to insufficient mechanical strength of the bank formed of the remaining quartz leading to local chipping i.e. leading to generation of a chipped portion as shown in .

The chipping of the side surface of the inner perimeter of the focus ring leads to exposure of the side surface of the lower electrode to plasma. As a result the insulating coating formed on the side surface of the lower electrode is damaged leading to a problem of abnormal discharge. Accordingly the duration of use of the focus ring is reduced to around 300 hours.

The quartz components such as the shield ring and the focus ring which reached their predetermined duration of use were subjected to restoration including formation of a bulge grinding and the like. When restoring the conventional quartz component having the uniform and flat main surface as shown in grinding is performed over the entire upper surface in order to make the main surface flat.

Accordingly restoration of the conventional quartz component such as the shield ring or the focus ring leads to a reduction of the thickness over the entire surface. In the normal grinding process the reduction of the thickness was 0.3 mm including the margin of error of machining.

In this case in particular reduction of the thickness of the focus ring poses a serious problem. Reduction of the thickness of the focus ring leads to a problem where the focus ring loses the ability to protect the side surface of the lower electrode. A maximum acceptable amount of reduction of the thickness of the focus ring is about 0.6 mm. Accordingly the maximum number of times that the focus ring can be restored for reuse is only two times.

Similarly other quartz components such as the shield ring and the like can only be restored for reuse for a limited number of times.

Next the influence of the height offset on the main surfaces of the quartz component on the process characteristics was examined.

The quartz components shield ring focus ring had longitudinal cross sectional configuration as shown in . In both the shield ring and the focus ring the main surface was divided into the first region and the second region wherein the first region was formed with a width of 35 mm from the inner perimeter. The main surface was divided into the first region and the second region by a height offset of 0.3 to 3.0 mm. That is the quartz component had the first region with a greater height than that of the second region by this range of height offset.

The etching rates and the pattern shift shown in are the most important characteristics for etching of silicon dioxide films. It can be understood that an offset with a height of up to 3 mm does not substantially affect the etching properties.

Note that the characteristics shown in are measured for an Ar diluted plasma processing gas shown in Table 1. Generally the flow of etching gas readily affects processing characteristics using a He diluted plasma compared with that using an Ar diluted plasma. Accordingly the same characteristics were measured under the processing conditions shown in Table 3.

As can be understood from the measured results shown in the greater the height offset the greater the etching rates of silicon dioxide and silicon and the pattern shift. It can be also understood that the height offset is preferably formed at about 2 mm or less for the purpose of suppressing the pattern shift to about 10 .

As described above the height offset is preferably formed at about 2 mm or less for the purpose of not affecting the processing performance in various types of plasma processing. On the other hand as described above the minimal height offset is about 0.1 mm and is preferably about 0.3 mm or more for realizing stable and long term use by repetition of restoration taking into account a margin of error of grinding.

As described above the quartz component according to this invention has a configuration in which the region that readily suffers damage is formed in the shape of a ridge and accordingly long term use can be achieved by repeated restoration. As a result the operating costs are reduced and the efficiency of utilization of resources is improved.

Furthermore as shown in the focus ring includes a beveled portion on the inner perimeter of the mounting surface lower surface . The beveled portion prevents the lower electrode from suffering damage during mounting and detaching the focus ring thereby extending the duration of use of the lower electrode .

While description has been made regarding examples wherein this invention is applied to a dry etching apparatus applications of this invention are not limited to those examples. Rather this invention may be applied to various types of plasma processing apparatuses.

For example in a chemical vapor deposition CVD apparatus plasma etching is performed in order to remove deposited material adhered to the surface of the component inside the chamber. Accordingly this invention can be effectively applied to quartz components in CVD apparatuses that suffer plasma damage during plasma etching operations.

In the above described examples description has been made regarding cases where this invention is applied to the focus ring and the shield ring of a plasma processing apparatus for processing circular semiconductor wafers. In this case each of the focus ring and the shield ring is formed in substantially the shape of a doughnut. The quartz components according to this invention are not limited to doughnut shaped components.

For example rectangular frame shaped quartz components are employed for the plasma processing apparatus for processing rectangular substrates for liquid crystal display devices.

In the above described examples description has been made regarding cases where the quartz components and the restoration methods according to this invention are applied to the quartz components in a plasma processing apparatus in which radio frequency RF electric power is applied to both the upper electrode and the lower electrode of the parallel plate electrodes.

As described above the inner perimeter of the main surface of the quartz component which surrounds the outer perimeter of the parallel plate electrodes is seriously damaged due to exposure to plasma. Accordingly this invention is greatly advantageous.

In particular the quartz component or components that surrounds one or both of the electrodes to which the electric power is applied is are severely damaged due to irradiation by ions accelerated by bias voltage induced on the electrode s to which the electric power is applied. This invention is particularly advantageous to be applied in such severely damaged components.

That is in the case of the plasma processing apparatus employing a split coupling configuration it is advantageous to apply this invention to both of the quartz components that surround the upper and lower electrodes. In the case of the plasma processing apparatus employing the anode coupling configuration it is particularly advantageous to apply this invention to the quartz component that surrounds the upper anode electrode. In the case of a plasma processing apparatus employing a cathode coupling configuration it is particularly advantageous to apply this invention to the quartz component that surrounds the lower cathode electrode.

The arrangement to which this invention is applied is not limited to the quartz components that surround the outer perimeters of the upper and lower electrodes of the parallel plate plasma processing apparatus.

Plasma processing apparatus such as ECR Electro Cyclotron Resonance plasma processing apparatus ICP Inductively Coupled Plasma plasma processing apparatus or the like do not have an electrode corresponding to the upper electrode. Even in such plasma processing apparatus RF electric power is applied to the lower electrode for mounting a workpiece to be processed as well in order to control the bias voltage for example. Accordingly the quartz component and the restoration method according to this invention are preferably applied to the component that surrounds the outer perimeter of the lower electrode.
