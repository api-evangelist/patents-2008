title: System and method for scoring constructed responses
abstract: A computerized system for scoring constructed responses to one or more prompts. The system receives a plurality of constructed responses in an electronic font-based format and separates the plurality of constructed responses into a first group of constructed responses that are scorable by the system and a second group of constructed responses that are not scorable by the system. The constructed responses in the first group are assigned scores based on predetermined rules, and the scores are sent to a score database. In a preferred embodiment, the first group includes constructed responses that do not answer the prompt and constructed responses that match pre-scored responses. The second group of constructed responses are sent by the system to a hand-scorer for manual scoring.

The present invention relates generally to systems and methods for scoring constructed responses generated by one or more students in response to one or more prompts and more particularly to systems and methods that reduce the amount of hand scoring needed to score short answer constructed responses.

Schools in the United States and other parts of the world have been administering standardized tests for many years. In practice standardized tests often include some combination of multiple choice questions and questions requiring a written response such as an essay or a constructed response. The term constructed response as used herein refers to a short text string containing a limited amount of highly specific impersonal information. The number of distinct correct responses is very limited but there are many ways to construct a correct response. An essay differs from a constructed response in that it is a literary composition on a particular theme or subject in prose and generally analytic speculative or interpretative in nature and typically consists of and is influenced by a student s own personal thoughts feelings ideas preferences and knowledge and seeks to be one of an infinite number of highly variable correct responses.

Multiple choice questions are a convenient way to assess achievement or ability in part because an answer is chosen from a finite set of pre constructed responses and the answer can be scored quickly and accurately using automated techniques. However because students are presented with pre constructed responses it is possible for a student to guess the right answer without having a requisite level of achievement or ability. Constructed responses require the student to answer by constructing a response and therefore the correct answer cannot be guessed from a set of options. Constructed responses are usually graded by hand because of the difficulty in accounting for all the various ways in which a response may be constructed.

Hand scoring constructed responses is time consuming and expensive. Graders use rubrics rules or guidelines and anchor papers examples of papers for each possible score to determine the grade to be given to a response. The process can take several minutes for each response. In addition it is well known that agreement between scorers can vary depending on the test item rubric and the scoring session. For this reason some states pay to have two or more scorers read each paper to improve reliability though this does not eliminate the possibility of assigning an incorrect score. Automated grading systems have been proposed to reduce the time and expense associated with scoring constructed responses and to ensure scoring consistency. To date only systems that score writing essays as compared to short answer constructed response items have provided an acceptable degree of accuracy in comparison with hand scoring.

The primary object of the present invention is to overcome the deficiencies of the prior art described above by providing a system method and computer program product that reduces the number of constructed responses that are hand scored thereby lowering the overall cost of scoring.

In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention a system for scoring constructed responses includes a computer with a processor and a memory device storing a set of digital instructions executable by said processor to perform the steps of receiving a plurality of constructed responses in an electronic font based format separating the plurality of constructed responses into a first group of constructed responses that are scorable by the system and a second group of constructed responses that are not scorable by the system assigning scores to each of the constructed responses in the first group of constructed responses sending the scores to a score database and submitting the second group of constructed responses to a hand scoring entity for manual scoring.

In accordance with a second aspect of the present invention a method of scoring constructed responses includes the steps of receiving a plurality of constructed responses in an electronic font based format separating the plurality of constructed responses into a first group of constructed responses that are scorable by the system and a second group of constructed responses that are not scorable by the system assigning scores to each of the constructed responses in the first group of constructed responses sending the scores to a score database and submitting the second group of constructed responses to a hand scoring entity for manual scoring.

In accordance with a third aspect of the present invention a computerized system for scoring constructed responses includes means for receiving a plurality of constructed responses in an electronic font based format means for separating the plurality of constructed responses into a first group of constructed responses that are scorable by the system and a second group of constructed responses that are not scorable by the system means for assigning scores to each of the constructed responses in the first group of constructed responses means for sending the scores to a score database and means for submitting the second group of constructed responses to a hand scoring entity for manual scoring.

Further features and advantages of the present invention as well as the structure and operation of various embodiments of the present invention are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.

Operation of the automated scoring system is illustrated in the flow chart shown in . In step s the system reads constructed response records or data from a table of unscored constructed responses e.g. a to be scored table with a timestamp set at the time of storage stored by the test administration system. The records are preferably read one at a time in serial fashion by the system in step s. Alternatively the system can be configured to read multiple records in parallel. At step s the system determines whether or not the constructed response item was scored by the automated scoring software. If the system determines that the constructed response item was not scored by the automated scoring software then the item is submitted for hand scoring for example by adding the item to a table of unscored constructed responses e.g. a to be manually scored table as shown at step s. If the system determines that the item was scored by the automated scoring software then the score data is submitted to the score database e.g. in a items scored table as shown in step s.

The automated scoring system is preferably implemented using a computer with a processor and a digital storage device e.g. a hard drive or the like storing a set of machine readable instructions i.e. automated scoring software that is executable by the processor to cause the system to process student responses in accordance with the present invention. In general the system will receive student responses in a digital font based format will attempt to score the responses and will separate the responses into a first group of responses that could be scored by the system and a second group of responses that could not be scored by the system and must therefore be submitted for hand scoring.

The software used by the system to process the student responses includes at least one and preferably both of a first subset of instructions i.e. a first software module referred to as a list based processor and a second subset of instructions i.e. a second software module referred to as a parser. The parser captures non scorable responses or responses that are not meaningful and would otherwise receive the lowest score e.g. a score of 0 points . In a preferred embodiment the parser sets a code to evaluate the non meaningful text and this code can be then be used to score the response. For example in a preferred embodiment the parser pre processes a student response e.g. removing extra white space capitalizing characters and then examines the response to determine whether it is blank too short non English e.g. gibberish off topic a refusal e.g. This is stupid I don t know or a copy of the prompt or item instructions. If the parser identifies the response as non scorable it sets a code that indicates the type of non scorable response e.g. BL for blank assigns the response a score of 0 and sets a flag that indicates that the response was scored by the parser. The parser can score multi part items and scores each part individually. The user can choose to use any of the parser features and can use the features in any order. The user sets thresholds to determine when a response is non English too short off topic or a copy of the item or prompt. The user can add to an existing list of refusal phrases and a list of the code combinations for the Parser to score as 0.

The list based processor compares an unscored student response to a list of already scored student responses. For this reason the list based processor is particularly useful in evaluating short answer constructed responses as opposed to essays. In a preferred embodiment the program pre processes responses according to parameters set by the user e.g. removing extra white space or all white space changing case removing characters . The processed response is then submitted to a replacement engine that searches the response for phrases that are replaced with more common phrases or are removed. Once the response has been pre processed and terms have been replaced the response is then compared to a similarly processed scored response. If an exact match is found then the list based processor assigns the response the score of the matched scored response. The user supplies the list of replacement terms the list of scored responses and the pre processing parameters.

The parser and the list based processor can be executed in any order. In addition the user can opt to use one or both of the submodules. is a flow chart illustrating an embodiment of the present invention wherein the system first sends the unscored constructed response to the list based processor and then only if the list based processor is unable to assign a score to the parser. More specifically in step s the automated scoring system receives a constructed response from the test administration system. The automated scoring system submits the constructed response to the list based processor in step s. The list based processor compares the response against pre scored responses and generates a code indicative of whether the response was scored as well as a score if a match is found. In step s the system receives the code and the score if any from the list based processor. At step s the system determines whether or not the response was scored by the list based processor. If the system determines that the list based processor was unable to score the response the response is sent to the parser in step s. The parser checks the response for non scorable answers and assigns appropriate flags and codes which are received by the system in step s. In step s the system determines whether a score was assigned by the parser. If the system determines that a score was assigned the score is saved with any codes and flags at step s. Otherwise the response is sent to the hand scoring system at step s.

At step s the parser creates a parser code e.g. PS CODE from the feature codes set in the foregoing steps. The PS CODE is a concatenation of the feature codes e.g. PS CODE Part . For instance the PS Code may have the form BL RF if the first part of a response is blank and the second part is a refusal. If the Parser did not assign a feature code to an part response and thus the response part is assigned a value of . . . . This value indicates that the response part was not identified as non scorable by the parser. A determination is then made at step s whether the parser code matches a scorable code combination. For example a scorable code combination might be that the PS CODE has a non Null feature code for each item part. Thus a code of BL RF is a scorable code combination but a code of . . . BL is not. If the parser determines that the parser code matches a code combination the parser saves to the database a flag to indicate that the response has been scored by the parser and the score as shown in step s. If the parser determines that the parser code does not match a code combination the original non preprocessed response is sent to another scorer such as the list processor or hand scorer in step s.

At step s the parser determines whether or not each student response trigraph is of the form AAA AA AA O O or O where A is any alphabetic character and O is the letter O . If the parser determines that the student response trigraph is one of these forms then it considers this trigraph to be a valid one for consideration. For example a HE trigraph is valid while a S is not valid. At this point the non english feature increments the number of total trigraphs totaltrigraph variable . It also checks against a list of common English and math trigraphs in step e.g. see the first row of Table I indicated by a 1 in the left most column and increments the number of matched trigraphs matchtrigraph variable if the trigraph is found in this list. If the trigraph is not valid then no change to the totaltrigraph or matchtrigraph variables are made. In step s the parser calculates the proportion of non matched student response trigraphs. If the first counter is less than five the parser sets the proportion to zero in step s because the number of trigraphs is too small to make a determination of non English. Otherwise the parser sets the proportion equal to the actual proportion i.e. 100 totaltrigraph matchtrigraph totaltrigraph in step s. If the proportion is greater than a predetermined threshold e.g. the NE threshold the parser codes the part as being a non English response in step s. If the proportion is less than or equal to the predetermined threshold the parser does not assign a code as shown in step s.

The parser reads in replacement terms e.g. replace DO NOT with DONT as shown in Table II below at step s and proceeds to pre processes the original and replacement terms at step s. At step s characters such as spaces commas semi colons etc. are stripped from the original and replacement terms. In addition the parser reads in a list of refusal terms at step s pre processes the refusal terms at step s and strips characters such as spaces commas semi colons etc. from the refusal terms at step s. In a preferred embodiment the refusal strings do not contain any of the replaced terms.

At step s the parser searches the pre processed and stripped student response for substrings that match the original term in the replacement list and if found the response part substring is replaced with the replacement term. The parser then compares the response part in its entirety to the refusal list in step s. Table III shows an example of a refusal list according to the present invention.

If an exact match is found the parser assigns the part as a refusal at step s. If the response part has a non zero length but an exact match is not found the parser does nothing at step s. If on the other hand the response part has a length equal to zero the parser assigns the response part as a refusal at step s. This latter situation results when a response consists entirely of white space and stripped characters.

At step s a decision is made whether or not to replace terms in the student and pre scored responses in step s. In a preferred embodiment the determination is based on a user setting. If the answer is yes the list based processor reads a term replacement list from a database and replaces terms in the pre processed student response and pre scored responses with similarly pre processed terms from the replacement list at step s. This replacement process is similar to that described for the refusal feature of the parser except that the replacement process also allows terms to be deleted from a response. Table IV shows an example of a term replacement list according to the present invention. As an example the response containing the term 15.00 is replaced with the term 15. 

The pre processed student response is then compared with pre scored responses at step s and a determination is made whether or not the pre processed student response exactly matches one of the pre scored responses at step s. If the pre processed student response exactly matches a pre scored response the list based processor assigns a score to the student response equal to the score assigned to the pre scored response matching the student response at step s. The list based processor preferably also sets a flag indicating that a score has been assigned. For example the list based processor may set a list based processor flag LP to 1. If on the other hand the pre processed score does not match any of the pre scored responses the list based processor submits the non pre processed student response for scoring by another entity e.g. hand scoring or parser scoring at step s. In this case the list based processor preferably sets a flag indicating that a score has not been assigned. For example the list based processor may set LP to 0 to indicate that a score has not been assigned.

The system may then display or print a report of the statistics in step s. The content and format of the report can be pre programmed or user defined.

From the above it will be appreciated that the automated scoring system and method of the present invention can reduce the number of constructed responses submitted for hand scoring thereby lowering a major source of costs in a scoring program. In a preferred embodiment the software attempts to score the responses. Responses that cannot be scored by the software are submitted for hand scoring. The software can be tailored to individual items by setting parameters and does not have to be trained with existing data.

The system and method includes two major parts referred to herein as a parser and a list based processor. Users can opt to use one or both parts and can implement the parts in any order. In an embodiment the parser has six features or functions aside from pre processing. The parser features can be implemented in any order. The system uses codes and flags as part of the method. For example in an embodiment of the parser the response is divided into parts as determined by the item and each part receives one code. The part codes are then combined into one response code. Each feature has a code associated with it that indicates whether that feature scored the response. If the code for a response is in the list of code combinations entered by the user the parser scores the response. Otherwise the Parser does not provide a score. The parser assigns responses only a score of 0. If the parser does not assign a score then the original un pre processed response is sent to another scoring entity such as the list based processor or hand scoring.

The list based processor pre processes responses and compares the pre processed responses to a pre existing list of similarly pre processed scored responses. The user can also opt to replace terms such as misspellings or remove terms in pre processed response and pre scored responses. If an exact match is found then the list based processor assigns the response the score of the matched scored response. If an exact match is not found then the original un pre processed response is sent to another scoring entity such as the parser or the hand scoring vendor.

The system and method can also optionally include a monitor that first queries the data for all records for the appropriate administration ID Form ID and for constructed response records only. The monitor then calculates statistics specific to the parser and statistics specific to the list based processor. Finally it calculates the score frequency distribution overall and for the automatically scored and optionally hand scored responses.

The automated scoring system and method can be used by one or more users. In addition different aspects of the system and method can be used by different users. For example members of the information technology team can enter automated scoring parameters lists from the research department and members of the research department or the client can use the constructed response monitoring portion to calculate statistics generate reports etc.

The systems processes and components set forth in the present description may be implemented using one or more general purpose computers microprocessors or the like programmed according to the teachings of the present specification as will be appreciated by those skilled in the relevant art s . Appropriate software coding can readily be prepared by skilled programmers based on the teachings of the present disclosure as will be apparent to those skilled in the relevant art s . The present invention thus also includes a computer based product which may be hosted on a storage medium and include instructions that can be used to program a computer to perform a process in accordance with the present invention. The storage medium can include but is not limited to any type of disk including a floppy disk optical disk CDROM magneto optical disk ROMs RAMs EPROMs EEPROMs flash memory magnetic or optical cards or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions either locally or remotely. The automated scoring system and method can be implemented on one or more computers. If more than one computer is used the computers can be the same or different from one another but preferably each have at least one processor and at least one digital storage device capable of storing a set of machine readable instructions i.e. computer software executable by the at least one processor to perform the desired functions where by digital storage device is meant any type of media or device for storing information in a digital format on a permanent or temporary basis such as for example a magnetic hard disk flash memory an optical disk random access memory RAM etc.

The computer software stored on the computer software when executed by the computer s processor causes the computer to retrieve constructed responses from a database or digital media. The software when executed by the server s processor also causes the server to process the constructed responses in the manner previously described.

The scoring system can be located at the testing facility or at a site remote from the testing facility. Communication between the scoring and testing computers can be accomplished via a direct connection or a network such as a LAN an intranet or the Internet.

The foregoing has described the principles embodiments and modes of operation of the present invention. However the invention should not be construed as being limited to the particular embodiments described above as they should be regarded as being illustrative and not as restrictive. It should be appreciated that variations may be made in those embodiments by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention.
