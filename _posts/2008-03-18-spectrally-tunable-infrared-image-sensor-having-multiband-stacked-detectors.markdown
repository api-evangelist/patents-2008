 Technical data that may be disclosed in this application is at the date of filing of the application authorized by the U.S. Government for export only to Australia for use by the University of Western Australia in accordance with Agreement No. TA 2039 03 IAW and 22 CFR 125.4 b 2 .

The present invention relates to image sensors more particularly to a spectrally tunable infrared image sensor having multi band stacked detectors.

The current generation of hyperspectral imaging HSI systems for use in the infrared wavelength bands employ a focal plane array FPA with a broad spectral response integrated in a diffraction grating based on a Fourier transform spectrometer. An HSI system would be more widely deployable and available for applications if the system is miniaturized into a small package in an integrated microsystem without sacrificing the performance that existing systems provide. Recently an approach for miniaturizing a hyperspectral imaging system on a chip has been demonstrated by integration of the broadband detection capability of a HgCdTe infrared detector with an electronically tunable filter all on a single chip. Narrowband wavelength tunability is achieved by a Micro Electro Mechanical System MEMS based tunable Fabry Perot F P filter fabricated directly on a photodetector. A readout integrated circuit ROIC serves to both integrate the detected signal as well as electronically tune the filter across the wavelength band. The F P filters use dielectric mirrors in the form of distributed Bragg reflectors which are formed from alternating layers of high and low refractive index low loss materials such as Ge and SiO.

A key shortcoming of this approach is that the spectral tuning range of a F P filter is generally limited to one octave in bandwidth range. In practice the range is often lower due to the limitations in spectral width of the reflectors used to form the F P resonant cavity. It is therefore not possible to use a single F P cavity filter to tune over the wavelength range of for example 1.0 2.5 m or the shortwave infrared SWIR band a spectral band of considerable practical interest.

Therefore there is a need for a spectrally tunable infrared detector or sensor that overcomes the problems noted above and others previously experienced for detecting a wide range e.g. more than one octave of infrared wavelengths.

Systems and articles of manufacture consistent with the present invention provide a tunable infrared detector and an infrared imaging system employing one or more of the tunable infrared detectors. The tunable infrared detector comprises a substrate a bottom wavelength detector formed over the substrate a top wavelength detector formed over the first wavelength detector layer and an interferometer filter formed over the top wavelength detector layer and the bottom wavelength detector layer. The interferometer filter is operatively configured to pass a first wavelength associated with a first portion of a predetermined band and a second wavelength associated with a second portion of the predetermined band to the top wavelength detector. The top wavelength detector is operatively configured to detect each wavelength associated with the first portion of the predetermined band and to transmit each wavelength associated with the second portion of the predetermined band to the bottom wavelength detector. The bottom wavelength detector is operatively configured to detect each wavelength associated with the second portion of the predetermined band.

In one implementation the interferometer filter includes a first mirror having a first plurality of dielectric layers a second mirror having a second plurality of dielectric layers and a pair of flexible supports disposed between the first mirror and the second mirror such that the first mirror is substantially parallel with and disposed a first predetermined distance over the second mirror. Each of the flexible supports is operatively configured to receive an electrical or mechanical input and to move the first mirror from the first predetermined distance to a second predetermined distance over the second mirror in accordance with the electrical or mechanical input. In this implementation the interferometer filter may be operatively configured to pass a third wavelength associated with the first portion of the predetermined band and a fourth wavelength associated with the second portion of the predetermined band to the top wavelength detector when the first mirror is disposed at the second predetermined distance over the second mirror.

Other systems methods features and advantages of the present invention will be or will become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems methods features and advantages be included within this description be within the scope of the invention and be protected by the accompanying claims.

Reference will now be made in detail to an implementation in accordance with methods systems and products consistent with the present invention as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.

The bottom wavelength detector and the top wavelength detector may each be a photoconductor or photodiode comprising an infrared sensitive material such as mercury cadmium telluride HgCdTe indium gallium arsenide InGaAs including platinum silicide PtSi or indium antimonide InSb . The top wavelength detector is operatively configured to detect a first wavelength or each wavelength associated with the first portion of the predetermined band and to transmit the second wavelength or each wavelength associated with the second portion of the predetermined band to the bottom wavelength detector . The bottom wavelength detector is operatively configured to detect the second wavelength or each wavelength transmitted through the top wavelength detector . Each of the detectors and is operatively connected to output on a respective via structure or to the readout circuit a respective radiation signal corresponding to a radiation level of the respective detected wavelength or

In one implementation the top wavelength detector is operatively configured to have a first cutoff wavelength e.g. 1.4 m corresponding to the first portion or order of the SWIR band allowing wavelengths equal to or greater the first cutoff wavelength e.g. greater than 1.4 m to be transmitted through the top wavelength detector . In this implementation the bottom wavelength detector is operatively configured to have a second cutoff wavelength e.g. 2.3 m corresponding to the second portion or order of the SWIR band so that wavelengths between the first and second cutoff wavelengths may be detected by the bottom wavelength detector . In one implementation the cutoff wavelength of each detector layer is controlled by choosing the appropriate alloy composition of the infrared sensitive material e.g. HgCdTe material used to form the detectors and .

Each of the detectors and may be fabricated in a high density vertically integrated photodiode HDVIP format in which each of the two layers are passivated on both sides and then mounted sequentially on the readout circuit with epoxy. The interferometer filter is fabricated using a known MEMS fabrication technique such that the interferometer filter extends over both the top wavelength detector and the bottom wavelength detector . In the implementation shown in the top wavelength detector is fabricated to be stacked on top of the bottom wavelength detector . However where space on the substrate is not a concern the two detectors and may be fabricated such that a portion of the top wavelength detector overlaps a portion of the bottom wavelength detector and an active area of the interferometer filter is formed to extend over the overlapping portions of the two detectors and .

In the implementation shown in the interferometer filter includes a first mirror having a first plurality of dielectric layers and a second mirror having a second plurality of dielectric layers and and a pair of flexible supports and disposed between the first mirror and the second mirror such that the first mirror is substantially parallel with and disposed a first predetermined distance d over the second mirror . To enable the interferometer filter to be tuned in accordance with the present invention the flexible supports and are operatively configured to move the first mirror from the first predetermined distance d to a second predetermined distance d over the second mirror in response to an electrical or mechanical input from the readout circuit on a corresponding wire via or through the detectors and . Accordingly the first and second mirrors and define a optically resonant cavity that may be selectively adjusted between the first and second predetermined distances d and d as shown in . In one implementation the readout circuit has a step and tune circuit to operatively control the spacing of the cavity between the first and second predetermined distances d and d by providing the respective electrical or mechanical input on the wire vias and . In this implementation each flexible support and includes a respective membrane member or upon which the first mirror is disposed or formed. Each membrane member and is adapted to be biased away from the first mirror based on the electrical or mechanical input from the step and tune circuit so that the first mirror moves from the first predetermined distance d to the second predetermined distance d over the second mirror .

At the first predetermined distance d the first and second mirrors and collectively enable the first wavelength in the first portion or order e.g. 1 1.4 m of the predetermined band and the second wavelength in the second portion or order e.g. 1.5 2.5 m of the predetermined band e.g. the SWIR band to pass through the interferometer filter to the top wavelength detector . When the top wavelength detector has a first cut off wavelength corresponding to the first portion or order of the predetermined band the top wavelength detector absorbs the radiation of the wavelength in the first portion of the predetermined band and allows the wavelength in the second portion of the predetermined band as received from the interferometer filter to pass through to the bottom wavelength detector . At the second predetermined distance d the first and second mirrors and collectively enable another or third wavelength in the first portion or order e.g. 1 1.4 m of the predetermined band and another or fourth wavelength in the second portion or order e.g. 1.5 2.5 m of the predetermined band e.g. the SWIR band to pass through the interferometer filter to the top wavelength detector for detection by the respective detectors and . Thus in accordance with the present invention the interferometer filter may be tuned by adjusting the spacing or distance between the mirrors and to enable two wavelengths within the predetermined band e.g. SWIR band to pass through to and be detected by the dual band detector where one of the two wavelengths is in the first portion e.g. shorter wavelengths of the predetermined band and another of the two wavelengths is in the second portion e.g. longer wavelengths of the predetermined band.

In one implementation the first mirror and the second mirror are each a Bragg mirror. In this implementation the dielectric layers and of the first mirror and the dielectric layers and of the second mirror each comprise an alternating sequence of layers of two different dielectric materials or low loss material in which the first of the two dielectric materials has a high refractive index and the second of the two dielectric materials has a low refractive index. For example the high refractive index dielectric material may be germanium Ge and the low refractive index dielectric material may be some form of silicon oxide SiOx .

In another implementation the first mirror and the second mirror are each a chirped Bragg mirror. In this implementation the dielectric layers and of the first mirror and the dielectric layers and of the second mirror each comprise an alternating sequence of layers of two different dielectric materials having a high refractive index and a low refractive index respectively as described above. However in this implementation each of the dielectric layers and of the first mirror has a respective thickness and the thickness of at least one of the dielectric layers of the first mirror is different than the thickness of each of the first mirror s other layers. As shown in each of the first mirror s dielectric layers and has a different thickness and are arranged such that the thickness of each layer and varies relative to thickness of an adjacent layer and . The dielectric layers and of the second mirror correspond in reverse sequential order to the dielectric layers and of the first mirror such that the first layer of the first mirror corresponds in thickness and dielectric material to the last layer of the second mirror .

One advantage of chirping or varying the thickness of the respective dielectric layers of each mirror and is to extend the range over which high reflectivity for the respective mirror and may be achieved for a given ratio of high to low refractive index dielectric layers of the respective mirrors and . The width g of the high reflectivity band in a standard quarter wave Bragg mirror is related to nand n the high and low values of refractive index of two adjacent layers e.g. and in the mirror as shown in Equation 1 .

Another advantage of chirping or varying the thickness of the respective dielectric layers of each mirror and is to modify the phase response of each mirror and in the optically resonant cavity in accordance with the present invention. Accordingly the chirped Bragg mirrors and allows control over the position and number of resonant peaks for a selected separation of the mirrors and between the predetermined distances d and d . In addition because the chirped Bragg mirrors and may be selectively separated in accordance with the present invention to rapidly vary the collective phase response of the interferometer filter the mirrors and enable narrower resonance peaks to be obtained for a given reflectivity than standard Bragg mirrors resulting in the reflectivity of each mirror and being reduced for a given spectral linewidth. Accordingly to tune over the predetermined band e.g. the SWIR band of 1000 nm to 2500 nm the mirrors and are structured such that there are only two narrow well spaced resonant peaks for each cavity spacing e.g. at the predetermined distances d and d .

In the implementation shown in each detector and comprises a photodiode that is electrically connected to a respective one of the via structures or for reading out to the readout circuit the radiation level of a corresponding wavelength or detected by the respective detector and in accordance with the present invention. The via structures and are formed by dry etching techniques such as by electron cyclotron resonance ECR or inductively coupled plasma ICP processes. Via is not essential for the functioning of the device but is included to show that in both bands detection can be designed to be spatially co located.

In this implementation the spacing between the two mirrors and was varied from the first predetermined distance d of 1.4 m to the second predetermined distance d of 0.8 m. As shown in narrow band filter first order response is obtained in the 1 1.4 m band with corresponding second order response in the 1.5 2.3 m band. In this implementation the maximum transmission of the interferometer filter varies in the range of 70 80 over the entire 1 2.5 m band.

In accordance with the present invention the interferometer filter is fabricated on the dual band detector the top wavelength detector of the dual band detector has a cutoff wavelength of 1.4 m and the bottom wavelength detector of the dual band detector has a cutoff wavelength of 2.3 m. In this implementation the top detector responds to or is operatively configured to detect the first order transmission or response of the interferometer filter absorbing all radiation of wavelengths less than 1.4 m and transmitting to the bottom detector radiation of wavelengths equal to or greater than 1.4 m. The bottom detector responds to or is operatively configured to detect the second order transmission or response of the interferometer filter . Thus in accordance with the present invention the interferometer filter having the two chirped Bragg mirrors and formed or mounted over the dual band detector enables the respective infrared detector to be operatively configured for hyperspectral detection in the 1 2.3 m spectral range well beyond the maximum of one octave spectral response possible with a conventional single band detector.

In accordance with the present invention the readout circuit is operatively configured to electronically step or tune the interferometer filter across the wavelength band by adjusting the spacing or cavity between the mirrors and . To adjust the spacing or cavity to tune the filter the readout circuit provides to the mirror support members and an electrical or mechanical input corresponding to the respective wavelength to be detected by the top detector and the bottom detector . In one implementation the step and tune circuit of the readout circuit operates in a voltage control mode or in a charge control mode. Both modes incorporate a feedback loop control circuit not shown in the figures to dampen and stabilize any vibrational effects on the mirrors and of the filter . For operation at a predetermined distance d where d d d between the mirrors and the top detector is operatively configured to detect narrowband radiation at a first order response wavelength corresponding to the predetermined distance and the bottom detector is operatively configured to detect wideband radiation at a second order response wavelength corresponding to the same predetermined distance. In the response curves and each reflect the respective first order wavelength within the first portion e.g. 1.0 1.4 m of the predetermined SWIR band and the corresponding second order wavelength within the second portion e.g. 1.4 2.3 m of the predetermined SWIR band passed by the filter when the predetermined distance d between the mirrors and is set to 1400 nm 1350 nm 1300 nm 1250 nm 1200 nm 1150 nm 1100 nm 1050 nm 1000 nm 950 nm 900 nm 850 nm and 800 nm respectively. For example in the implementation shown in when the step and tune circuit of the readout circuit sets the predetermine distance between the mirrors and to be 1250 nm the first order response wavelength of 1250 nm is transmitted through the filter and detected by the top detector while the second order response wavelength of 2125 nm is transmitted through the filter and the top detector and detected by the bottom detector . As discussed herein the readout circuit is operatively configured to read and integrate the respective radiation wavelength signal detected by each detector or .
