Embodiments relate generally to management of confidential information and in particular to methods and apparatus related to transmission of confidential associated with a subject entity to a relying entity.

In societies with electronic enabled economies relatively large numbers of transactions take place among parties who have limited knowledge about one another. When parties engage in a transaction a party also referred to as a relying party may hope to acquire specified information e.g. confidential information personally identifiable information about another party also referred to as a subject party to facilitate and or enable the transaction. A relying party may wish to acquire information such as 

Among the unintended consequences of the widespread availability of information such as personally identifiable information either through purchase accidental exposure and or theft has led to for example the undesirable exploitation of such information for criminal purposes e.g. identity theft . This type of exploitation can be a financial and or an emotional burden on the subject of the exposed information. Although certain organizations such as government agencies are beginning to enact rules and or regulations to protect information and or promote the availability of information so that information can be readily transferred between parties these efforts have many short comings. Thus a need exists for methods and apparatus related to transmission of confidential information associated with a subject party to a relying party.

In one embodiment a method includes defining a request for confidential information from a domain of confidential information based on an input from a relying entity. The domain of confidential information can be associated with a subject entity. A response to the request can be defined at an information provider. The method can also include sending the response to the relying entity when the response has been approved by the subject entity.

An information management module can be configured to manage processing e.g. handling transmission updating of confidential information associated with one or more entities e.g. individuals businesses organizations an agent e.g. a human agent an electronic agent of an individual business organization . Specifically the information management module can be configured to manage transfer of confidential information associated with a subject entity to a relying entity. In some embodiments the subject entity can be referred to as subject entity because the confidential information can be related to e.g. owned by about created by the subject entity. In some embodiments the subject entity can be referred to as a subject party. The relying entity can be any entity that is attempting to obtain confidential information associated with the subject entity. In some embodiments the relying entity can be referred to as a relying party.

The confidential information can be requested by the relying entity via the information management module. A request for the confidential information and or a response e.g. a proposed response to the confidential information can be reviewed by the subject entity before the response is sent to the relying entity. Moreover the subject entity can have the opportunity to assess the accuracy appropriateness of the request and or the confidential information included in the response to the request. In some embodiments the request can be defined based on one or more predefined queries and the request can be a request for confidential information from a domain of confidential information.

In some embodiments the information management module can be configured so that the subject entity can modify approve and or disapprove one or more portions of a request and or a response to the request for confidential information via the information management module. In some embodiments the subject entity and or the relying entity can negotiate transfer of confidential information via the information management module. In some embodiments a request for confidential information can be defined e.g. automatically defined based on a request policy defined by the subject entity and or defined by the relying entity. The request policy defined by the subject entity can be configured to trigger updates e.g. automatic updates of confidential information associated with the subject entity. The request policy defined by the relying entity can be used by for example an information management module to define e.g. automatically define a request for confidential information. In some embodiments a response to the confidential information can be defined based on a response policy defined by the subject entity and or the relying entity. In some embodiments the response policy can be defined so that a desirable level of confidential information e.g. a minimal level a specified level is shared with a relying entity. In some embodiments transactions related to the information management module the relying entity and or the subject entity can be tracked e.g. collected stored by the information management module.

In some embodiments the relying entity and or subject entity can engage in a negotiation process e.g. iterative negotiation process with respect to the confidential information request and or proposed responses to the confidential information request. For example the subject entity can receive a query and associated proposed response to the query within a confidential information request. The query and the associated proposed response to the query can be defined in part by the information management module . If the subject entity denies the query and disallows sending of the proposed response to the query the information management module can be configured to notify the relying entity of the denial. In response the relying entity can trigger defining and sending of a modified confidential information request to the subject entity . The information management module can be configured to send the modified confidential information request and proposed response to the modified confidential information request to the subject entity for further processing e.g. approval .

As shown in a confidential information request that includes predefined query QA predefined query QA and predefined query QBis defined in response to a signal from a relying entity . Specifically the relying entity can select the predefined queries from the sets of predefined queries to define the confidential information request . Although not shown the confidential information request can be sent to a subject entity for processing e.g. approval disapproval . Although not shown in some embodiments the request template can have more or less predefined query sets than those shown in . The predefined query set and the predefined query set can be selected by the relying entity from a library of predefined query sets not shown .

In some embodiments each set of predefined queries can be related to a specific type of confidential information. For example predefined query set can be related to an age of a person and predefined query set can be related to a medical condition of a person. In some embodiments one or more predefined queries from predefined query set and one or more predefined queries from predefined query set can be related to similar or the same type of confidential information.

In some embodiments each set of predefined queries can have queries related to different privacy levels and or levels of specificity. For example predefined query QAand predefined query QAcan be associated with different privacy levels. In some embodiments for example the predefined queries within predefined query set can increase in privacy level from predefined query QA most invasive to predefined query QA least invasive . In some embodiments for example predefined query QAcan be a question asking for information about whether or not an individual is greater than 21 years old while predefined query QAcan be a question asking for a birth date of the individual. In this case predefined query QAis a less specific predefined query less invasive than predefined query QA more invasive .

In some embodiments the confidential information request can be defined based on a request policy not shown defined by the relying entity also can be referred to as a relying entity request policy . For example the request policy can be configured to trigger the information management module to automatically define the confidential information request based on only predefined query set and or based only predefined queries associated with for example a particular privacy level.

In some embodiments a request policy can be configured to trigger the information management module to request updates of confidential information based on specified predefined queries at specified times at regular times and or at random times. In some embodiments this type of request policy can be referred to as an update policy. The update requests can be defined by the information management module based on the request policy and can be update requests targeted to the relying entity a subject entity not shown and or a third party not shown . In some embodiments an update policy can be defined by the relying entity and or a subject entity not shown .

As shown in the request template is included in an information management module . In some embodiments the request template can be included in a memory not shown at or separate from the information management module that can be accessed by the information management module .

In some embodiments a request policy associated with e.g. defined by a subject entity can be configured to prevent specified predefined queries from being selected by the relying entity or a request policy associated with the relying entity . A request policy associated with a subject entity can be referred to as a subject entity request policy and a request policy associated with the relying entity can be referred to as a relying entity request policy. For example the information management module can be configured to provide only specified predefined queries e.g. predefined query sets and or predefined queries to a relying entity for possible selection based on a request policy. In some embodiments for example the request policy can be defined so that specified predefined queries are provided to the relying entity based on a trust level e.g. a specified assurance level a specified level of authentication a high security access level associated with the relying entity and or based an entity type e.g. hospital government agency trusted partner acquaintance private unknown individual internet vendor associated with the relying entity .

In some embodiments the information management module can be configured to notify the relying entity that specified predefined queries cannot be selected based on a specified trust level value e.g. assurance level value . In some embodiments the trust level value can be determined based on an authentication process e.g. based on authentication of the relying entity with a specified security level attested by a digital certificate . In some embodiments for example if the relying entity selects or attempts to select a particular predefined query for inclusion in the confidential information request the information management module can be configured to notify the relying entity that the particular predefined query cannot be selected or may be ignored by the subject entity based on a request policy associated with the subject entity.

In some embodiments the predefined queries provided to the relying entity for possible selection can be determined e.g. defined based on a domain of confidential information. For example only those predefined queries e.g. predefined query sets and or predefined queries from a predefined query set that are related to a specified domain of confidential information can be provided to the relying entity for selection in defining a confidential information request . In some embodiments the predefined queries can be provided to the relying entity for selection via a user interface such as a graphical user interface not shown .

In some embodiments the confidential information request can include customized queries not shown in addition to predefined queries. The customized queries can be queries defined based on a module e.g. a function provided by the information management module . In some embodiments a request for confidential information not shown can be defined by the relying entity based entirely on customized queries that are not predefined.

As shown in the domain of confidential information is a subset of confidential information that can be defined based on an intersection of a portion of confidential information associated with the trust level value and based on a portion of the confidential information associated with the relying entity type value . As shown in a confidential information request can be defined based on the domain of confidential information .

In some embodiments for example the portion of the confidential information can be associated with a first set of predefined queries and the portion of the confidential information can be associated with a second set of predefined queries. The intersection of the portion of the confidential information and the portion of the confidential information can be used to determine a third set of predefined queries. The third set of predefined queries can be provided e.g. presented to a relying entity and used by the relying entity to define the confidential information request .

In some embodiments the confidential information can be associated with one or more subject entities. In some embodiments if associated with multiple subject entities the domain of confidential information can be further limited based on an identity of the subject entity.

In some embodiments a domain of confidential information not shown can be determined based on a relying entity value alone or based on a trust level value alone. In some embodiments the domain of confidential information can be determined based on a parameter value e.g. a confidential information category value in addition to the trust level value and the relying entity type value shown in . More details related to confidential information category values are discussed in connection with . In some embodiments the trust level value and or the relying entity type value can be predefined values that can be determined from a database e.g. a look up table based on an identity e.g. a name of a relying entity. An example of such a database is shown in .

In some embodiments the relying entity type value and the trust level value can be determined based on an identity e.g. a name of the relying entity. The identity can be determined based on for example a digital signature a username an identifier and so forth associated with the relying entity.

As shown in the portion of confidential information can be defined based on relying entity type values and trust level values associated with a specified subject entity . For example a domain of confidential information associated with subject entity Y column when a relying entity has the relying entity type value of A column and the trust level value of Q column is different than a domain of confidential information associated with subject entity Y when the relying entity or different relying entity has the relying entity type value of A column and the trust level value of R column .

As shown in the domain of confidential information associated with subject entity X is the same no matter what the relying entity type value or trust level value which are both shown with the wildcard value . In this case all data types associated with subject entity X are eligible to be requested in a confidential information request by a relying entity.

Relationships between at least some of the confidential information categories and portions of the confidential information are shown in . Specifically confidential information category CAT D is associated with portion of confidential information confidential information category CAT E is associated with portion of confidential information and confidential information category CAT E is associated with portion of confidential information .

If the confidential information is associated with a subject entity the confidential information categories can be navigated via for example a user interface e.g. a user interface of a device such as a terminal device a kiosk and or a processing device by a relying entity to select a portion of confidential information associated with the subject entity. The portion of confidential information can correspond with a domain of confidential information from which a confidential information request can be defined. For example confidential information request can be defined based on one or more predefined queries associated with portion of confidential information which can be associated with a subject entity when confidential information category CAT E is selected by for example a relying entity.

One or more of the confidential information categories can be for example a medical information category a financial information category and so forth. In some embodiments the child categories can be subsets e.g. species of the parent categories. In some embodiments confidential information categories that can be used to select a portion of confidential information e.g. define a domain of a confidential information may not be hierarchically related. In some embodiments the confidential information can be related to more than one subject entity. Accordingly the confidential information categories can be used to define a domain of confidential information associated with more than one subject entity. In some embodiments multiple confidential information categories can be selected and the intersection of portions of confidential information can define a domain of confidential information.

In some embodiments the hierarchical structure of the confidential information categories can be defined based on an identity of a subject entity. For example a set of confidential information categories associated with a first subject entity can be different than a set of confidential information categories associated with a second subject entity because the confidential information available in for example a database for the first subject entity can be different than the confidential information available for the second subject entity.

In some embodiments a domain of confidential information can be determined based on a parameter value in addition to one or more of the confidential information categories . For example a domain of confidential information can be defined based on one or more of the confidential information categories as well as based a trust level value and or a relying entity type value.

An identifier associated with a subject entity is received based on a selection of the subject by the relying entity at . The relying entity can select the specified subject entity because the relying entity is interested in requesting confidential information related to the subject entity. In some embodiments the selection of the subject entity can be performed via a processing device e.g. a kiosk a computing device associated with the information management module. In some embodiments the subject entity can be automatically selected based on a request policy defined by the relying entity. In response to the selection of the subject entity the identifier can be received at the information management module.

A trust level value and or an entity type value associated with the relying entity is received at . In some embodiments the trust level value and or the entity type value can be determined based on an identity associated with the relying entity. In some embodiments the identity of the relying entity can be determined e.g. acquired ascertained when the relying entity is authenticated at . In some embodiments the trust level value and or the entity type value can be determined based on entries included in a database.

An indicator of a confidential information category that has been selected by the relying entity is received at . The confidential information category can be selected by the relying entity via a processing device associated with for example the information management module.
