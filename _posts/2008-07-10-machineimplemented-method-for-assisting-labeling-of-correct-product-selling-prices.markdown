title: Machine-implemented method for assisting labeling of correct product selling prices
abstract: In a machine-implemented method for assisting labeling of correct product selling prices on a shopping website, upon receipt of an input of a product name and a selling price of a product, a network interface program is enabled to search a specific shopping website for selling prices of related product items. An average selling price of the related product items thus located is found, and a determination as to whether a difference between the inputted product selling price and the average selling price is greater than a preset value is made. Acceptance of the inputted product selling price is refused and a warning message is issued if affirmative. The inputted product selling price is accepted and stored if otherwise. Accordingly, an operator of the shopping website can be assisted to detect pricing errors so as to prevent labeling of incorrect product selling prices due to oversight.

The invention relates to a method for inputting product selling prices more particularly to a machine implemented method for assisting labeling of correct product selling prices on a shopping website.

Due to the fast development of the Internet and the relative ease to establish network connections shopping websites that operate on the Internet have become very popular and consumers enjoy the fun of shopping on line without physically going to a store.

Since a shopping website in general displays images of products sold in conjunction with descriptions of the products to serve as a reference for consumers which is unlike physical shops that have shopkeepers or sales personnel to answer inquiries of consumers the prices of virtually all the products sold on a shopping website are displayed on the shopping website for reference by the consumers. Therefore an operator of the shopping website generally needs to input relevant product information at a server of the shopping website. Because the product information including product selling prices is inputted manually human errors are inevitable. Pricing errors may result in an influx of orders from consumers if the prices are unreasonably low or a lack of orders if the prices are unreasonably high. In the former case the shopping website will suffer monetary losses. In the latter case the concerned product will not sell well.

Therefore if the selling price of a product sold on the shopping website can be compared with products of the same kind sold on other shopping websites during inputting of the selling price of the product it would help the operator of the shopping website detect pricing errors to thereby eliminate the aforesaid undesirable scenarios in which there is an unusually large amount of orders received for a particular product or a lack of orders.

Therefore the object of the present invention is to provide a machine implemented method for assisting labeling of correct product selling prices on a shopping website so as prevent input of an incorrect product selling price by an operator of the shopping website.

Accordingly the machine implemented method for assisting labeling of correct product selling prices on a shopping website of this invention includes 

 A receiving a product name and a product selling price of a product inputted by an operator of the shopping website 

 B searching a specific shopping website to locate selling prices of related product items related to the inputted product name 

 D determining whether a difference between the inputted product selling price and the average selling price is greater than a preset value refusing to accept the inputted product selling price if affirmative and accepting the inputted product selling price if otherwise.

Preferably in step A the product name and the product selling price inputted are received by a network interface program having an input module.

Preferably in step B a network interface program having a search module is used to connect to a specific search engine so as to search the specific shopping website for URLs of the related product items on the specific shopping website and so as to subsequently obtain the selling prices of the related product items from web pages at the located URLs.

Preferably the selling prices of the related product items located in step B are displayed via a network interface program having a display module so as to allow the operator of the shopping website to delete the selling prices of any unsuitable product items step C being executed after receiving a confirmation from the operator.

Preferably in step D the comparison module determines whether the difference between the inputted product selling price and the average selling price is greater than the preset value acceptance of the inputted product selling price being refused if affirmative and a warning message being issued through the display module of the network interface program the inputted product selling price being accepted and stored if otherwise.

Preferably the difference is a percentage value obtained by dividing an absolute value of a difference between the inputted product selling price and the average selling price by the inputted product selling price and the preset value is a price difference percentage value preset by the network interface program.

Preferably the machine implemented method of the present invention further includes a step E after step D enabling the display module to display the located selling prices and the related product items while issuing the warning message enabling the comparison module to determine whether a portion of the related product items and the selling prices thereof has been deleted the selling prices of the remaining related product items being re averaged so as to obtain a new average selling price and step D being repeated thereafter if affirmative whether the inputted product selling price has been changed or whether a new product selling price for the product has been inputted being determined if otherwise wherein step D is repeated if affirmative and the display module continues to issue the warning message if otherwise.

Preferably the machine implemented method of the present invention further includes a step E after step D determining whether the inputted product selling price has been changed or whether a new product selling price for the product has been inputted step D being repeated if affirmative.

Preferably the machine implemented method of the present invention further includes a step E after step D while the display module issues the warning message enabling the comparison module to determine whether the inputted product selling price has been changed or whether a new product selling price for the product has been inputted step D being repeated if affirmative the display module continuing to issue the warning message if otherwise.

Referring to a system to implement the machine implemented method for assisting labeling of correct product selling prices on a shopping website according to this invention includes a memory which stores an operating system a network interface program and a database program . In addition the system further includes a central processing unit an input device such as a keyboard and a bus . The memory the central processing unit and the input device are interconnected through the bus .

Software program for constructing the shopping website is constituted by the database program and the network interface program .

An operator of the shopping website can use the input device such as a keyboard to add or edit product data put product items on or off shelves handle purchase orders etc.

To prevent the operator of the shopping website from inadvertently inputting incorrect product selling prices when entering product data via the database program as shown in the first preferred embodiment of a machine implemented method for assisting labeling of correct product selling prices on a shopping website according to this invention is realized by a software program. The software program includes the following steps.

Referring to the software program for assisting labeling of correct product selling prices on a shopping website includes the network interface program e.g. an Application Programming Interface API provided by a search engine such as Google or Yahoo pre installed in the system. The network interface program includes an input module a search module a comparison module and a display module .

Referring to in step the product name of a product e.g. Nokia N95 cell phone and a selling price of the product are received from the operator of the shopping website via the input device . In step the input module of the network interface program automatically sets the product name Nokia N95 cell phone and the name of a specific shopping website e.g. PC Home as search keywords and sends the set keywords to the search module . Based on the set keywords the search module searches the specific shopping website PC Home for web pages containing selling prices of related product items and sends URLs of located web pages to the comparison module . The comparison module obtains information of names and selling prices of the related product items from the located web pages and transmits the information to the display module .

In step the comparison module averages the selling prices of the related product items located in the search to obtain an average selling price and determines whether a difference between the product selling price inputted by the operator of the shopping website and the average selling price is greater than a preset value. Preferably the preset value is a tolerable price difference percentage value and the determination is made by subtracting the average selling price from the inputted product selling price to find a difference obtaining an absolute value of the difference dividing the difference by the inputted product selling price to obtain a price difference percentage value and determining whether the price difference percentage value is greater than the preset value. If the price difference percentage value is greater than the preset value in step the comparison module notifies the display module to issue a warning message through a computer screen or a speaker for example so as to notify the operator of the shopping website that the product selling price inputted thereby may be incorrect. At the same time in step the display module displays the related product items and the selling prices used for averaging in step for viewing by the operator so as to allow the operator to identify any unsuitable product items that should not have been included in the averaging step e.g. a peripheral product associated with Nokia N95 but is not the cell phone Nokia N95. The operator of the shopping website can then delete the selling prices of the unsuitable product items through the network interface program .

In step if the comparison module determines a deletion of any of the displayed selling prices of the related product items the comparison module will re average the selling prices of the remaining related product items in step to obtain a new average selling price. The flow then returns to the aforesaid step to re determine whether the product selling price inputted by the operator is correct based on the new average selling price.

If the price difference percentage value found in step is smaller than the preset value the comparison module will determine that the product selling price inputted by the operator is correct and step is executed in which the inputted product selling price is accepted and stored in the memory to be displayed as a part of the product data for browsing by prospective customers on the Internet.

When the comparison module determines no deletion of the selling prices of the related product items in step step is executed to determine whether there is a new input or a change of the product selling price. If yes step is executed to determine whether the inputted product selling price is correct. Otherwise step is executed to cause the display module to continue to issue the warning message.

It is apparent from the foregoing that by comparing the inputted product selling price with an average selling price of the same products or products within the same category sold on a specific shopping website the present invention can assist operators of shopping websites to detect pricing errors thereby eliminating undesirable scenarios in which unusually large or small amounts of orders are received for a particular product due to input of incorrect selling prices.

Referring to the second preferred embodiment of a machine implemented method for assisting labeling of correct product selling prices on a shopping website according to this invention is realized by a software program that includes the following steps 

Initially steps and which are identical to the aforesaid steps and in the first preferred embodiment are executed. Upon receipt of an input of a product name and a product selling price from the operator of the shopping website the input module transmits the inputted product name and product selling price to the search module . The search module then searches web pages of a specific shopping website for selling prices of identical or similar product items. In step the search module sends information of the related product items thus located and the selling prices thereof to the display module for viewing by the operator of the shopping website. The operator of the shopping website can then delete any product items and the associated selling prices that are unsuitable for comparison. Upon receipt from the operator of a confirmation to proceed with the price comparing procedure the comparison module executes step to obtain an average of the selling prices of the related product items so as to compute an average selling price of the related product items. Step identical to the aforesaid step is then executed to determine whether a difference between the inputted product selling price and the average selling price is greater than a preset value. If yes step identical to the aforesaid step is executed to enable the display module to issue a warning message. Subsequently in step the comparison module determines whether there is a new input or a change of the product selling price by the operator. If yes step is executed to determine whether a difference between the newly inputted product selling price and the average selling price is greater than the preset value. Otherwise step is executed to cause the display module to continue to issue the warning message. If the inputted product selling price is determined to be correct by the comparison module of the network interface program in step step is executed in which the comparison module accepts the inputted product selling price and stores the same in the memory .

It is thus apparent from the foregoing description that the second preferred embodiment differs from the first preferred embodiment in that in the second preferred embodiment prior to obtaining an average selling price information of the related product items and the selling prices thereof are displayed to the operator of the shopping website to allow the operator to delete any unsuitable product items so as to obtain a more accurate average selling price for comparison with the inputted product selling price thereby obtaining a more accurate determination result. In the first preferred embodiment an average selling price is directly obtained from the selling prices of the related product items and the related product items and the selling prices thereof are displayed to the operator of the shopping website upon the issuance of the warning message so as to allow the operator to detect any unsuitable product items that may affect the average selling price before making a new comparison. Although there are slight differences between the first and second preferred embodiments both of the first and second preferred embodiments can achieve the intended object of assisting operators of shopping websites to input correct product selling prices.

While the present invention has been described in connection with what are considered the most practical and preferred embodiments it is understood that this invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments but is intended to cover various arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and equivalent arrangements.
