title: Software framework for evolving specifications in process control system
abstract: A software application architecture based on object oriented concepts. According to an aspect, upgrading the application to support newer versions of a standard describing device description is simplified. According to another aspect, the application is designed to be tolerant to changes (additions or modifications) introduced by future/later versions not yet supported by the application. In an embodiment, the approaches are applied in the context of a parser designed to parse device descriptions of different versions.
