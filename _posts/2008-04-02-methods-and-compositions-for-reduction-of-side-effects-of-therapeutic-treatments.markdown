Many of the leading treatments for diseases lead to undesired side effects. For instance levodopa the standard for Parkinson s disease treatment is associated with debilitating abnormal involuntary movements or dyskinesias. These motor abnormalities may occur after only a few months of treatment and affect the majority of patients within 5 10 years. They can be quite incapacitating and represent a major complication in Parkinson s disease management. Currently there are only limited therapeutic options for dyskinesias.

Parkinson s disease is extremely common amongst those over 65 and age group that in North America is predicted to rise from 12 to 24 over the next 30 year. The overall prevalence of Parkinson s disease in this population is in the order of 1.5 2 and increases with age. Therefore additional treatments are needed for this disabling complication of levodopa therapy.

Localization of cholinergic neurons in striatum. Cholinergic neurons in the striatum are large interneurons that comprise about 2 of the neuronal population. Although limited in number these interneurons have large axonal arbors that provide for a very dense local innervation in both the caudate and putamen. Indeed high levels of acetylcholine the acetylcholine synthesizing enzyme choline acetyltransferase and the acetylcholine degradative enzyme acetylcholinesterase are expressed in the striatum. These cholinergic markers overlap with dopaminergic arbors containing dopamine the dopamine synthetic enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase and other dopaminergic markers that are also expressed at a relatively high density. Without being limited to any theory the overlapping distribution of the cholinergic and dopaminergic system provides the anatomical basis for a functional interaction between these two neurotransmitters.

Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in striatum Striatal cholinergic interneurons are tonically active with a resultant ongoing release of acetylcholine that is regulated by multiple striatal systems including glutamatergic dopaminergic GABAergic serotonergic and other inputs. Released acetylcholine interacts with nAChRs present on dopaminergic as well as other striatal neurons. These receptors are pentameric ligand gated ion channels composed only of subunits homomeric or of and subunits heteromeric receptors . To date six different 2 3 4 5 6 7 and three different 2 3 4 subunits have been identified in the nigrostriatal pathway. These subunits combine to form nAChRs with the primary subtypes in the striatum composed of 4 2 and 3 6 2 subunits as well as a small population of homomeric 7 nAChRs. The asterisks indicate that there are other subunits some not yet identified that are also present and may be species dependent . The 4 2 receptors are localized on dopaminergic terminals as well as other neurons in the striatum and throughout the CNS. However they are not present in the peripheral nervous system or skeletal muscle. Interestingly 3 6 2 receptor subtypes are selectively localized to the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway and only a limited number of other brain areas suggesting they may be of particular relevance to nigrostriatal function. These latter receptors 3 6 2 are designated as expressing 3 and or 6 subunits because both are present in monkey striatum and conotoxinMII the ligand used to identify these receptors interacts with both 3 and 6 nAChR subtypes. Without being limited to any theory the presence of different receptor populations on dopaminergic neurons raises the possibility that select subtypes may be more directly linked to the development of dyskinesias and the antidyskinetic properties of nicotine. Such knowledge would allow for the development of nAChR agonists more specifically targeted to ameliorating dyskinesias.

Striatal nicotinic receptor activation results in dopamine release. Endogenously released acetylcholine or exogenously applied agents such as nicotine and nicotinic agonists are known to stimulate nAChRs on dopaminergic neurons with increases in dopamine release in the striatum under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. Agonist evoked dopamine release in striatum occurs in response to stimulation of nAChR subtypes composed of 4 2 and 3 6 2 subunits. Without being limited to any theory the antidyskinetic effect of nicotine as described herein may be associated with changes in dopamine release after stimulation of 4 2 and or 3 6 2 nAChRs.

B. Striatal Dopaminergic System and its Involvement in Reduction of Dopaminergic Agent Treatment Side Effects.

One of the neurotransmitter systems responsible for the development of dopaminergic agent treatment side effects such as dyskinesias in parkinsonian animals or individuals with Parkinson s disease is the dopaminergic system itself. For instance D1 D2 and D3 receptor agonists all induce dyskinesias indicating that multiple receptor subtypes are involved. There appears to be an imbalance in activity of the two striatal output pathways with dyskinesias possibly through activation of D1 and inhibition of D2 receptors on the direct and indirect pathway respectively with D3 receptors possibly exerting a modulatory influence. Despite a clear requirement for dopamine receptor stimulation there are no consistent changes in the D1 D2 or D3 receptors themselves with dyskinesias. Without being limited to any theory such findings most likely indicate that levodopa induced changes may not occur at the receptor level but involve downstream signaling events. Recent data suggest that D1 receptors possibly through enhanced G protein coupling may play a role in dopaminergic agent induced dyskinesias while D2 receptors may be more relevant in mediating the antiparkinsonian action of dopaminergic agents. G proteins are membrane associated molecules that couple ligand activated neurotransmitter receptors to intracellular second messenger systems. D1 dopamine receptor stimulated striatal G protein coupling was enhanced in striatal tissue from monkeys with dopaminergic agent induced dyskinesias compared to controls. In addition recent data show that there is also enhanced opioid receptor coupling with dopaminergic agent induced dyskinesias another measure linked to activation of the D1 direct dopaminergic pathway. Increases have also been identified in cyclin dependent kinase 5 Cdk5 and dopamine cAMP regulated phosphoprotein DARPP 32 an important site for signal transduction integration in striatum. A down regulation of striatal D1 receptor NMDA receptor complexes has also been observed with the development of dyskinesias. Without being limited to any theory the ability of nicotine to reduce dopaminergic agent induced dyskinesias is likely related to normalization of the imbalance between striatal output pathways and modulation of signaling mechanisms.

In addition to changes in molecular markers linked to activation of the D1 direct dopaminergic pathway the development of dopaminergic agent induced dyskinesias is also associated with alterations in cellular function. In vivo and in vitro electrophysiological studies have been used to investigate basal ganglia function under normal conditions and in animals with nigrostriatal damage. This approach offers the advantage that it allows for a determination of changes in synaptic function and neuronal excitability not readily detectable using biochemical techniques. One in vitro preparation that has proved particularly useful to study the cellular mechanisms altered with dopaminergic agent induced dyskinesias are corticostriatal slices from rat brain. Brain slices at the level of the globus pallidus have generally been used as they incorporate many of the structures present in basal ganglia motor circuits. This includes glutamatergic inputs from the cortex that densely innervate striatal medium spiny GABAergic neurons and are a determinant of neuronal activity in striatal projection neurons. Synaptic plasticity defined as long lasting changes in the efficacy of synaptic transmission has been identified in corticostriatal slices in vitro in the form of long term potentiation LTP long term depression LTD and depotentiation. In slices from unlesioned rats high frequency stimulation HFS of glutamatergic corticostriatal afferent fibers can induce both LTD and LTP in striatal medium spiny neurons most likely due to a release of striatal glutamate which triggers dopamine release. Stimulation of both D1 and D2 receptors is required for the induction of LTD whereas these two receptor subtypes play opposing roles in LTP. This plasticity at corticostriatal synapses is sensitive to both dopamine exposure and nigrostriatal damage with a loss of plasticity with lesioning. Moreover it has been shown that chronic L dopa treatment modulates plasticity. It was found that L dopa treatment restores LTP in rats both without and with dyskinesias but that low frequency stimulation LFS induced responses depotentiation were specifically lost in dyskinetic rats. In addition it was found that exogenous dopamine induced a slow onset LTP in corticostriatal slices from L dopa treated dyskinetic animals but LTD in slices from nondyskinetic animals. Without being limited to any theory these data suggest that dopamine mediated activity dependent synaptic potentiation may be altered in dyskinetic compared to nondyskinetic animals. Accumulating evidence thus suggests that abnormal plasticity at corticostriatal synapses may be involved in the development of dopaminergic agent induced dyskinesias.

Interestingly these inventors have recently found that nicotine treatment modulates synaptic plasticity in corticostriatal slices from nonhuman primates. In particular it restores long term depression LTD that is lost as a result of nigrostriatal damage. Without being limited to any theory it is possible that that nicotine modulates synaptic plasticity and promotes functional restoration also in animals with dopaminergic agent induced dyskinesias and that this mechanism underlies its antidyskinetic effect.

In one aspect the invention provides compositions and methods to reduce or eliminate the effects of a dopaminergic agent. In some embodiments the compositions and methods retain or enhance a desired effect of the dopaminergic agent e.g. antiparkinsonian effect. The methods and compositions of the invention apply to any dopaminergic agent for which it is desired to reduce one or more side effects. In some embodiments the compositions and methods of the invention utilize a dopamine precursor. In some embodiments the compositions and methods of the invention utilize a dopamine agonist. In some embodiments the dopaminergic agent is levodopa bromocriptine pergolide pramipexole cabergoline ropinorole apomorphine or a combination thereof. In some embodiments the dopaminergic agent is levodopa. In some embodiments the compositions and methods of the invention utilize one or more agents used in the art in combination with a dopamine agent treatment to achieve a therapeutic effect. For instance in one exemplary embodiment the compositions and methods of the invention utilize levodopa in combination with an agent such as carbidopa which blocks the conversion of levodopa to dopamine in the blood. In another exemplary embodiment the compositions and methods of the invention utilize levodopa in combination with a COMT Inhibitor such as entacapone. In another exemplary embodiment the compositions and methods of the invention utilize levodopa in combination with a monoamine oxidase type B MAO B inhibitor such as selegiline. In yet another exemplary embodiment the compositions and methods of the invention utilize levodopa in combination with amantadine.

Levodopa an aromatic amino acid is a white crystalline compound slightly soluble in water with a molecular weight of 197.2. It is designated chemically as L a amino b 3 4 dihydroxybenzene propanoic acid. Its empirical formula is CHNO and its structural formula is

Levodopa is used for the treatment of Parkinson s disease. Parkinson s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the extrapyramidal nervous system affecting the mobility and control of the skeletal muscular system. Its characteristic features include resting tremor rigidity and bradykinetic movements

Current evidence indicates that symptoms of Parkinson s disease are related to depletion of dopamine in the corpus striatum. Administration of dopamine is ineffective in the treatment of Parkinson s disease apparently because it does not cross the blood brain barrier. However levodopa the metabolic precursor of dopamine does cross the blood brain barrier and presumably is converted to dopamine in the brain. This is thought to be the mechanism whereby levodopa relieves symptoms of Parkinson s disease.

However although initially very effective long term treatment with levodopa gives rise to multiple complications. Levodopa treatment may cause nausea vomiting involuntary movements e.g. dyskinesias mental disturbances depression syncope and hallucinations. The precise pathophysiological mechanisms of levodopa side effects are still enigmatic but are thought to be due to increased brain dopamine following administration of levodopa.

Previous work has shown that levodopa induced dyskinesias LIDs arise due to enhanced intermittent stimulation of D1 D2 and or other dopamine receptor subtypes. This results in an imbalance in activity of the two major striatal output pathways possibly through activation of D1 and inhibition of D2 receptors on the direct and indirect dopaminergic pathways respectively although there is some overlap between striatal efferents. Recent data suggest that D1 receptors through enhanced G protein coupling may play a more prominent role in functional hypersensitivity associated with levodopa induced dyskinesias while D2 receptor activation may be more closely linked to the antiparkinsonian action of dopaminergic drugs

The principal adverse reactions of dopaminergic agent include headache diarrhea hypertension nausea vomiting involuntary movements e.g. dyskinesias mental disturbances depression syncope hallucinations and abnormal renal function.

The invention provides compositions and methods utilizing a nicotinic receptor modulator that reduces or eliminates a side effect associated with dopaminergic agent treatment. In some embodiments the invention provides compositions and methods utilizing a nicotinic receptor modulator that reduces or eliminates dyskinesias associated with dopaminergic agent treatment. Without being limited to any theory one possibility is that nicotinic receptor modulator exerts its effect by acting at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors nAChR which are expressed in the striatum. There is a dense cholinergic innervation in striatum that closely coincides with dopaminergic neurons. Under physiological conditions these cholinergic interneurons tonically release acetylcholine which stimulates nicotinic receptors on dopaminergic nerve terminals to release dopamine. Similarly exogenously applied agents such as nicotine result in a release of dopamine from striatal terminals.

In some embodiments the invention provides compositions and methods utilizing a combination of a dopaminergic agent and a nicotinic receptor modulator that reduces or eliminates a side effect associated with dopaminergic agent treatment. Typically the nicotinic receptor modulator is an agonist. In some embodiments the nicotinic receptor agonist modulates a nicotinic receptor comprising at least one subunit or a nicotinic receptor containing at least one subunit and at least one subunit. In some embodiments the subunit is selected from the group consisting of 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 and the subunit is selected from the group consisting of 2 3 and 4. In some embodiments the nicotinic receptor agonist modulates a nicotinic receptor composed of subunits selected from the group consisting of 4 2 6 2 4 6 2 4 5 2 4 6 2 3 6 2 3 and 4 2 2. In some embodiments the nicotinic receptor modulator modulates a nicotinic receptor comprising at least one subunit selected from the group consisting of 4 6 and 7.

In some embodiments the dopaminergic agents include a dopamine precursor or a dopamine receptor agonist Examples of dopaminergic agents include but are not limited to levodopa bromocriptine pergolide pramipexole cabergoline ropinorole apomorphine or a combination thereof.

The nicotinic receptor modulator causing a decrease in the side effects of the dopaminergic agent may be an agonist or an antagonist of a protein. The modulatory effect may be dose dependent e.g. some modulators act as agonists in one dosage range and antagonists in another. In some embodiments a modulator of a nicotinic receptor is used in a dosage wherein it acts primarily as an agonist.

Typically the use of the nicotinic receptor modulator e.g. agonist results in a decrease in one or more side effects of the dopaminergic agent. The therapeutic effect s of the dopaminergic agent may be decreased remain the same or increase however in preferred embodiments if the therapeutic effect is decreased it is not decreased to the same degree as the side effects. It will be appreciated that a given dopaminergic agent may have more than one therapeutic effects and or one or more side effects and it is possible that the therapeutic ratio in this case the ratio of change in desired effect to change in undesired effect may vary depending on which effect is measured. However at least one therapeutic effect of the dopaminergic agent is decreased to a lesser degree than at least one side effect of the dopaminergic agent.

In addition in some embodiments one or more therapeutic effects of the dopaminergic agent are enhanced by use in combination with a nicotinic receptor modulator while one or more side effects of the dopaminergic agent is reduced or substantially eliminated. For example in some embodiments the antiparkinsonian effect of the dopaminergic agent is enhanced while one or more side effects of the dopaminergic agent is reduced or substantially eliminated.

Hence in some embodiments the invention provides compositions that include a dopaminergic agent and a nicotinic receptor modulator where the dopaminergic agent is present in an amount sufficient to exert a therapeutic effect and the nicotinic receptor modulator is present in an amount sufficient to decrease side effect of the dopaminergic agent when compared to the side effect without the nicotinic receptor modulator when the composition is administered to an animal.

The side effect may be acute or chronic. The effect may be biochemical cellular at the tissue level at the organ level at the multi organ level or at the level of the entire organism. The effect may manifest in one or more objective or subjective manners any of which may be used to measure the effect. If an effect is measured objectively or subjectively e.g. dyskinesias and the like any suitable method for evaluation of objective or subjective effect may be used. Examples include visual and numeric scales and the like for evaluation by an individual. A further example includes sleep latency for measurement of drowsiness or standard tests for measurement of concentration mentation memory and the like. These and other methods of objective and subjective evaluation of side effects by an objective observer the individual or both are well known in the art.

A therapeutic effect as that term is used herein encompasses a therapeutic benefit and or a prophylactic benefit. By therapeutic benefit is meant eradication or amelioration of the underlying disorder being treated. Also a therapeutic benefit is achieved with the eradication or amelioration of one or more of the physiological symptoms associated with the underlying disorder such that an improvement is observed in the patient notwithstanding that the patient may still be afflicted with the underlying disorder.

Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention suitable for oral administration can be presented as discrete dosage forms such as capsules cachets or tablets or liquids or aerosol sprays each containing a predetermined amount of an active ingredient as a powder or in granules a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non aqueous liquid an oil in water emulsion or a water in oil liquid emulsion. Such dosage forms can be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy but all methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier which constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then if necessary shaping the product into the desired presentation. For example a tablet can be prepared by compression or molding optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free flowing form such as powder or granules optionally mixed with an excipient such as but not limited to a binder a lubricant an inert diluent and or a surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.

This invention further encompasses anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising an active ingredient since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example water may be added e.g. 5 in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf life or the stability of formulations over time. Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention which contain lactose can be made anhydrous if substantial contact with moisture and or humidity during manufacturing packaging and or storage is expected. An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition may be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly anhydrous compositions may be packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include but are not limited to hermetically sealed foils plastic or the like unit dose containers blister packs and strip packs.

An active ingredient can be combined in an intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. In preparing the compositions for an oral dosage form any of the usual pharmaceutical media can be employed as carriers such as for example water glycols oils alcohols flavoring agents preservatives coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions solutions and elixirs or aerosols or carriers such as starches sugars micro crystalline cellulose diluents granulating agents lubricants binders and disintegrating agents can be used in the case of oral solid preparations in some embodiments without employing the use of lactose. For example suitable carriers include powders capsules and tablets with the solid oral preparations. If desired tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques.

Binders suitable for use in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include but are not limited to corn starch potato starch or other starches gelatin natural and synthetic gums such as acacia sodium alginate alginic acid other alginates powdered tragacanth guar gum cellulose and its derivatives e.g. ethyl cellulose cellulose acetate carboxymethyl cellulose calcium sodium carboxymethyl cellulose polyvinyl pyrrolidone methyl cellulose pre gelatinized starch hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose microcrystalline cellulose and mixtures thereof.

Examples of suitable fillers for use in the pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms disclosed herein include but are not limited to talc calcium carbonate e.g. granules or powder microcrystalline cellulose powdered cellulose dextrates kaolin mannitol silicic acid sorbitol starch pre gelatinized starch and mixtures thereof.

Disintegrants may be used in the compositions of the invention to provide tablets that disintegrate when exposed to an aqueous environment. Too much of a disintegrant may produce tablets which may disintegrate in the bottle. Too little may be insufficient for disintegration to occur and may thus alter the rate and extent of release of the active ingredient s from the dosage form. Thus a sufficient amount of disintegrant that is neither too little nor too much to detrimentally alter the release of the active ingredient s may be used to form the dosage forms of the compounds disclosed herein. The amount of disintegrant used may vary based upon the type of formulation and mode of administration and may be readily discernible to those of ordinary skill in the art. About 0.5 to about 15 weight percent of disintegrant or about 1 to about 5 weight percent of disintegrant may be used in the pharmaceutical composition. Disintegrants that can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include but are not limited to agar agar alginic acid calcium carbonate microcrystalline cellulose croscarmellose sodium crospovidone polacrilin potassium sodium starch glycolate potato or tapioca starch other starches pre gelatinized starch other starches clays other algins other celluloses gums or mixtures thereof.

Lubricants which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include but are not limited to calcium stearate magnesium stearate mineral oil light mineral oil glycerin sorbitol mannitol polyethylene glycol other glycols stearic acid sodium lauryl sulfate talc hydrogenated vegetable oil e.g. peanut oil cottonseed oil sunflower oil sesame oil olive oil corn oil and soybean oil zinc stearate ethyl oleate ethyl laureate agar or mixtures thereof. Additional lubricants include for example a syloid silica gel a coagulated aerosol of synthetic silica or mixtures thereof. A lubricant can optionally be added in an amount of less than about 1 weight percent of the pharmaceutical composition.

When aqueous suspensions and or elixirs are desired for oral administration the essential active ingredient therein may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents coloring matter or dyes and if so desired emulsifying and or suspending agents together with such diluents as water ethanol propylene glycol glycerin and various combinations thereof.

The tablets can be uncoated or coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate can be employed. Formulations for oral use can also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent for example calcium carbonate calcium phosphate or kaolin or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium for example peanut oil liquid paraffin or olive oil. The tablets can be disintegrating tablets for fast release of the therapeutic agent.

Surfactant which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include but are not limited to hydrophilic surfactants lipophilic surfactants and mixtures thereof. That is a mixture of hydrophilic surfactants may be employed a mixture of lipophilic surfactants may be employed or a mixture of at least one hydrophilic surfactant and at least one lipophilic surfactant may be employed.

A suitable hydrophilic surfactant may generally have an HLB value of at least 10 while suitable lipophilic surfactants may generally have an HLB value of or less than about 10. An empirical parameter used to characterize the relative hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of non ionic amphiphilic compounds is the hydrophilic lipophilic balance HLB value . Surfactants with lower HLB values are more lipophilic or hydrophobic and have greater solubility in oils while surfactants with higher HLB values are more hydrophilic and have greater solubility in aqueous solutions. Hydrophilic surfactants are generally considered to be those compounds having an HLB value greater than about 10 as well as anionic cationic or zwitterionic compounds for which the HLB scale is not generally applicable. Similarly lipophilic i.e. hydrophobic surfactants are compounds having an HLB value equal to or less than about 10.

However HLB value of a surfactant is merely a rough guide generally used to enable formulation of industrial pharmaceutical and cosmetic emulsions.

Hydrophilic surfactants may be either ionic or non ionic. Suitable ionic surfactants include but are not limited to alkylammonium salts fusidic acid salts fatty acid derivatives of amino acids oligopeptides and polypeptides glyceride derivatives of amino acids oligopeptides and polypeptides lecithins and hydrogenated lecithins lysolecithins and hydrogenated lysolecithins phospholipids and derivatives thereof lysophospholipids and derivatives thereof carnitine fatty acid ester salts salts of alkylsulfates fatty acid salts sodium docusate acyl lactylates mono and di acetylated tartaric acid esters of mono and di glycerides succinylated mono and di glycerides citric acid esters of mono and di glycerides and mixtures thereof.

Suitable lipophilic surfactants include by way of example only fatty alcohols glycerol fatty acid esters acetylated glycerol fatty acid esters lower alcohol fatty acids esters propylene glycol fatty acid esters sorbitan fatty acid esters polyethylene glycol sorbitan fatty acid esters sterols and sterol derivatives polyoxyethylated sterols and sterol derivatives polyethylene glycol alkyl ethers sugar esters sugar ethers lactic acid derivatives of mono and di glycerides hydrophobic transesterification products of a polyol with at least one member of the group consisting of glycerides vegetable oils hydrogenated vegetable oils fatty acids and sterols oil soluble vitamins vitamin derivatives and mixtures thereof. Within this group preferred lipophilic surfactants include glycerol fatty acid esters propylene glycol fatty acid esters and mixtures thereof or are hydrophobic transesterification products of a polyol with at least one member of the group consisting of vegetable oils hydrogenated vegetable oils and triglycerides.

In one embodiment the composition may include a solubilizer to ensure good solubilization and or dissolution of the dopaminergic agent and or nicotinic receptor modulator and to minimize precipitation of the dopaminergic agent and or nicotinic receptor modulator. This can be especially important for compositions for non oral use e.g. compositions for injection. A solubilizer may also be added to increase the solubility of the hydrophilic drug and or other components such as surfactants or to maintain the composition as a stable or homogeneous solution or dispersion.

Examples of suitable solubilizers include but are not limited to the following alcohols and polyols such as ethanol isopropanol butanol benzyl alcohol ethylene glycol propylene glycol butanediols and isomers thereof glycerol pentaerythritol sorbitol mannitol transcutol dimethyl isosorbide polyethylene glycol polypropylene glycol polyvinylalcohol hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and other cellulose derivatives cyclodextrins and cyclodextrin derivatives ethers of polyethylene glycols having an average molecular weight of about 200 to about 6000 such as tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol PEG ether glycofurol or methoxy PEG amides and other nitrogen containing compounds such as 2 pyrrolidone 2 piperidone .epsilon. caprolactam N alkylpyrrolidone N hydroxyalkylpyrrolidone N alkylpiperidone N alkylcaprolactam dimethylacetamide and polyvinylpyrrolidone esters such as ethyl propionate tributylcitrate acetyl triethylcitrate acetyl tributyl citrate triethylcitrate ethyl oleate ethyl caprylate ethyl butyrate triacetin propylene glycol monoacetate propylene glycol diacetate caprolactone and isomers thereof 6 valerolactone and isomers thereof butyrolactone and isomers thereof and other solubilizers known in the art such as dimethyl acetamide dimethyl isosorbide N methylpyrrolidones monooctanoin diethylene glycol monoethyl ether and water.

Mixtures of solubilizers may also be used. Examples include but not limited to triacetin triethylcitrate ethyl oleate ethyl caprylate dimethylacetamide N methylpyrrolidone N hydroxyethylpyrrolidone polyvinylpyrrolidone hydroxypropyl methylcellulose hydroxypropyl cyclodextrins ethanol polyethylene glycol 200 100 glycofurol transcutol propylene glycol and dimethyl isosorbide. Particularly preferred solubilizers include sorbitol glycerol triacetin ethyl alcohol PEG 400 glycofurol and propylene glycol.

The amount of solubilizer that can be included is not particularly limited. The amount of a given solubilizer may be limited to a bioacceptable amount which may be readily determined by one of skill in the art. In some circumstances it may be advantageous to include amounts of solubilizers far in excess of bioacceptable amounts for example to maximize the concentration of the drug with excess solubilizer removed prior to providing the composition to a patient using conventional techniques such as distillation or evaporation. Thus if present the solubilizer can be in a weight ratio of 10 25 50 100 or up to about 200 by weight based on the combined weight of the drug and other excipients. If desired very small amounts of solubilizer may also be used such as 5 2 1 or even less. Typically the solubilizer may be present in an amount of about 1 to about 100 more typically about 5 to about 25 by weight.

The composition can further include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable additives and excipients. Such additives and excipients include without limitation detackifiers anti foaming agents buffering agents polymers antioxidants preservatives chelating agents viscomodulators tonicifiers flavorants colorants odorants opacifiers suspending agents binders fillers plasticizers lubricants and mixtures thereof.

In addition an acid or a base may be incorporated into the composition to facilitate processing to enhance stability or for other reasons. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable bases include amino acids amino acid esters ammonium hydroxide potassium hydroxide sodium hydroxide sodium hydrogen carbonate aluminum hydroxide calcium carbonate magnesium hydroxide magnesium aluminum silicate synthetic aluminum silicate synthetic hydrocalcite magnesium aluminum hydroxide disopropylethylamine ethanolamine ethylenediamine triethanolamine triethylamine trisopropanolamine trimethylamine tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane TRIS and the like. Also suitable are bases that are salts of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as acetic acid acrylic acid adipic acid alginic acid alkanesulfonic acid amino acids ascorbic acid benzoic acid boric acid butyric acid carbonic acid citric acid fatty acids formic acid fumaric acid gluconic acid hydroquinosulfonic acid isoascorbic acid lactic acid maleic acid oxalic acid para bromophenylsulfonic acid propionic acid p toluenesulfonic acid salicylic acid stearic acid succinic acid tannic acid tartaric acid thioglycolic acid toluenesulfonic acid uric acid and the like. Salts of polyprotic acids such as sodium phosphate disodium hydrogen phosphate and sodium dihydrogen phosphate can also be used. When the base is a salt the cation can be any convenient and pharmaceutically acceptable cation such as ammonium alkali metals alkaline earth metals and the like. Example may include but not limited to sodium potassium lithium magnesium calcium and ammonium.

Suitable acids are pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic acids. Examples of suitable inorganic acids include hydrochloric acid hydrobromic acid hydriodic acid sulfuric acid nitric acid boric acid phosphoric acid and the like. Examples of suitable organic acids include acetic acid acrylic acid adipic acid alginic acid alkanesulfonic acids amino acids ascorbic acid benzoic acid boric acid butyric acid carbonic acid citric acid fatty acids formic acid fumaric acid gluconic acid hydroquinosulfonic acid isoascorbic acid lactic acid maleic acid methanesulfonic acid oxalic acid para bromophenylsulfonic acid propionic acid p toluenesulfonic acid salicylic acid stearic acid succinic acid tannic acid tartaric acid thioglycolic acid toluenesulfonic acid uric acid and the like.

Ann Neurol. 2000 47 S79 89 . All values were within the normal range. The monkeys were then injected subcutaneously with 2.0 mg kg MPTP Sigma St Louis Mo. dissolved in saline. The animals were rated for parkinsonism 3 4 weeks after MPTP administration. The disability scores ranged from 0 normal to 28 for a severely parkinsonian animal. Animals were assessed for 1 spatial hypokinesia reduction in use of the available cage space 2 body bradykinesia increased slowness in body movement 3 left and 4 right manual dexterity 5 balance 6 freezing and 7 action tremor. If they were not parkinsonian MPTP injection 1.0 2.0 mg kg was repeated from 2 5 times for total doses of 3.5 to 13.5 mg kg. Despite multiple MPTP dosing two of the animals were not stably parkinsonian. These two monkeys did exhibit reliable dyskinesias in response to levodopa treatment.

Nicotine treatment All monkeys n 7 were then given a drinking solution for 3 weeks consisting of commercially available orange Gatorade to mask nicotine s bitter taste . The control group n 4 was continued on Gatorade only while nicotine free base was added to the Gatorade of the treated group n 3 . Nicotine dosing was started at 50 g ml for 1 week 150 g ml for 1 week with the concentration increased by 150 g increments week over the next few weeks up to 650 g ml . Since the animals were relatively old and exhibited poor dentition the dried food pellets were softened with 25 ml of either Gatorade or the nicotine Gatorade for the treated animals to ensure adequate nicotine intake. There were no significant effects of nicotine treatment on body weight or fluid intake and the monkeys appeared in good health.

Levodopa administration Monkeys were administered levodopa carbidopa 5 mg kg and 1.25 mg kg respectively prepared by crushing a tablet of Sinemet CR 100 25 DuPont Pharma and dissolving it in water. This dose of levodopa is within the range of that prescribed to Parkinson s disease patients. The monkeys were gavaged twice daily at 3.5 hour intervals for 8 weeks at a time using a 5 day on 2 day off schedule Hsu et al. J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2004 311 770 777 . During levodopa treatment the monkeys were given fruits in the morning and food pellets 3.5 hours after the afternoon levodopa dose to optimize gastrointestinal absorption.

Dyskinesias were rated from videotapes as described Hsu et al. J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2004 311 770 777 . This included a one hour baseline period no drugs from 8 00 9 00 AM followed by two 3.5 hour treatment periods with levodopa starting at 9 00 AM and 12 30 PM. Dyskinesias were rated for 2 minute periods at 30 minute intervals by two independent raters blinded to treatment. They were rated on a scale of 0 no dyskinesias to 4 a score of 1 was indicative of subtle dyskinesias that were not sustained 2 mild dyskinesias that were sustained 3 moderate dyskinesias that impaired the ability to remain stationary 4 severe dyskinesias that were generalized and incapacitating.

Data analyses The levodopa treatment protocol used in the present study involved a 5 day on 2 day off schedule. Parkinsonian ratings were done on Monday and Friday of each week with the score averaged over the two days. Dyskinesias ratings were determined by averaging the scores on Wednesday and Thursday of each week. All values are expressed as the mean SE of the indicated number of animals. Results were compared using paired t tests or analysis of variance ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple comparison post hoc test using Prism program GraphPad Software Inc San Diego Calif. . A level of 0.05 was considered significant.

Measurement of plasma cotinine levels Plasma cotinine a major 75 nicotine metabolite was measured as an index of nicotine intake Hukkanen et al. Pharmacol Rev. 2005 57 79 115 and Matta et al. Psychopharmacology Berl . 2007 190 269 319 . Blood 1 2 ml was drawn from the femoral vein under ketamine sedation 15 20 mg kg intramuscularly at 3 PM. The blood samples were centrifuged at 1 000 g for 12 minutes and the plasma stored at 80 C. Plasma cotinine levels were measured using an ELISA kit OraSure Technologies Inc Bethleham Pa. . Plasma cotinine levels were 303 25 n 7 and fell within the range observed in cigarette smokers Hukkanen et al. Pharmacol Rev. 2005 57 79 115 and Matta et al. Psychopharmacology Berl . 2007 190 269 319 .

Time course of the nicotine induced decline in levodopa induced dyskinesias in monkeys with nigrostriatal damage Nicotine treatment n 3 resulted in a reduction in levodopa induced dyskinesias over the course of the day as compared to non nicotine treated animals n 4 . This decline was observed over the entire 8 week period investigated with the data for weeks 2 4 6 and 8 depicted in . In monkeys not receiving nicotine dyskinesias developed rapidly following levodopa administration were maximal after 30 90 minutes and declined over the remaining two hours . Dyskinesias were significantly reduced in nicotine treated animals compared to monkeys not receiving nicotine. For instance at 8 weeks ANOVA yielded a significant main effect of nicotine treatment F 1 80 54.24 p

Decline in total dyskinesias in monkeys receiving nicotine treatment It was next examined the effect of nicotine treatment on the total dyskinetic response by evaluating the area under the curve of the time course. A significant decrease was observed in nicotine treated animals at all time points compared to monkeys not receiving nicotine . For instance at the 8 week time point there was a significant main effect of nicotine by ANOVA F 1 10 11.41 p 0.007 with no effect of time.

Nicotine treatment decreases peak dose dyskinesias Peak dyskinesias defined as the maximal dyskinetic score during the morning or afternoon were decreased throughout the 8 week levodopa treatment period in nicotine treated animals compared to control . For instance at 8 weeks there was a significant main effect of nicotine by ANOVA F 1 10 7.90 p 0.0184 with no main effect of time.

Nicotine shortened the duration of dyskinesias Dyskinesias were still evident in the non nicotine treated monkeys 3 hours after the second daily levodopa administration but not in animals treated with nicotine Table 1 . ANOVA showed there was a main effect of nicotine treatment F 1 20 18.33 p 0.0004 but not time indicating no difference across the 8 week rating period Table 1 .

Crossover study The data depicted in and Table 1 clearly showed that nicotine administration attenuated levodopa induced dyskinesias. A crossover study was then conducted in which the animals originally receiving nicotine were given vehicle n 3 while the vehicle treated animals were now administered nicotine n 4 . Levodopa treatment was stopped. The concentration of nicotine was gradually increased in the drinking water see to 650 g ml at which the animals were maintained for 4 weeks. Monkeys that had previously received nicotine were placed on vehicle drinking water for the same time period. All monkeys were then treated with levodopa 5 mg kg twice daily 3.5 hours apart for a subsequent 8 week period. Since both groups of monkeys had previously received levodopa they were termed levodopa primed.

Nicotine administration decreased levodopa induced dyskinesias in levodopa primed monkeys For these analyses the ratings obtained for each animal on the new treatment were compared to the score of the same animal in the previous treatment period that is prior to crossover. The results in show that nicotine administration significantly reduced total dyskinesias at all time points using paired t tests. Analyses of the dyskinetic time course also showed a main effect of nicotine throughout levodopa treatment by ANOVA for example week 8 F 1 114 15.89 p 0.0001 . Peak dyskinesias were significantly reduced during the last 4 weeks of levodopa treatment week 6 p 0.0354 and week 8 p 0.0138 by paired t tests . There was also a decrease in the duration of dyskinesias with nicotine treatment with a significant main effect of nicotine by ANOVA F 1 24 18.00 p 0.0003 . Thus nicotine administration reduced levodopa induced dyskinesias in animals previously exposed to levodopa.

Removal of nicotine increases levodopa induced dyskinesias in levodopa primed monkeys By contrast in animals removed from nicotine treatment total dyskinetic scores were significantly enhanced at week 4 6 and 8 of levodopa treatment . Analyses of the time course of dyskinesias also showed an increase in dyskinesias over the 8 week levodopa treatment with ANOVA yielding a significant main effect of nicotine for example week 8 F 1 76 15.94 p 0.0001 . In addition there was a significant increase in the duration of dyskinesia assessed 3 hours after the afternoon levodopa dose with a significant main effect of nicotine by two way ANOVA F 1 16 5.33 p 0.0346 . Thus removal of nicotine enhanced levodopa induced dyskinesias.

Nicotine administration does not affect parkinsonism on or off levodopa treatment Levodopa administration reduced parkinsonism ratings which were measured 1.5 2 hours after levodopa dosing when its effects are maximal and Table 2 . Nicotine treatment did not affect parkinsonism either on of off levodopa treatment F 1 16 0.03 p 0.8718 .

The results from example 1 and 2 are the first to show that nicotine treatment attenuates levodopa induced dyskinesias in nonhuman primates. Nicotine treatment significantly reduced both the peak and duration of the dyskinetic response. Importantly this was not accompanied by a worsening of parkinsonism either on or off levodopa. In animals pretreated with nicotine that is levodopa na ve monkeys there was 60 decline in levodopa induced dyskinesias. In addition nicotine treatment reduced dyskinesias by 35 in monkeys that had received previously been treated with levodopa that is in levodopa primed monkeys.

Animals Two groups of experimental animals see Table 3 are required for these experiments to determine the effectiveness of minipump administration in reducing dyskinesias in lesioned monkeys

MPTP treatment. All animals are lesioned with an injection of MPTP 1.5 2.0 mg kg sc . The animals are rated for parkinsonism 3 4 weeks after lesioning according to methods described in example 1. If an animal is not parkinsonian MPTP injection will be repeated up to 4 times. The lesioning process may therefore require up to 4 months to generate animals with parkinsonism. Eight animals are required per group as our objective is to obtain stably parkinsonian animals. In general 80 of the animals develop stable parkinsonism. The animals are then allowed to recover from the last MPTP injection for 1 month to ensure they are stably parkinsonian before the minipumps are surgically implanted.

Minipump delivery Nicotine is delivered via a minipump according to standard procedure using the 0.2 ml pump ALZET to release nicotine over a 4 week period. Nicotine is administered at a dose of 0.5 mg kg day free base . This dose is chosen based on previous data in nonhuman primates known in the art. Surgically implanted minipumps containing nicotine and the treatment appears to be well tolerated with no appreciable weight loss or adverse effects. The non nicotine treated group will receive vehicle in the pump. Plasma nicotine and cotinine levels will be measured 1 2 weeks after minipump implantation to ensure adequate nicotine dosing as described in example 1. The objective is to achieve levels similar to those in our current study involving nicotine administration in the drinking water 500 ng ml . The pumps are replaced monthly to ensure that the supply of nicotine remains constant. The animals receive nicotine for 2 months prior to the initiation of L dopa treatment.

L Dopa After 2 months of nicotine infusion both groups of monkeys either vehicle or nicotine are gavaged with L dopa carbidopa 5 mg kg 1.25 mg kg twice daily at 9 00 AM and 1 00 PM. Treatment is performed on a 5 day on 2 day off schedule and is done for at least 4 weeks. If nicotine treatment reduces dyskinesias L dopa treatment is continued up to 2 months to allow us to determine how long the decrease in dyskinesias is maintained.

Parkinsonism will be rated using a modified nonhuman primate parkinsonian rating scale as described in example 1. Dyskinesias are monitored from videotapes using the rating system detailed in example 1. Parkinsonian ratings are done throughout the entire treatment period 9 months 3 times weekly. Dyskinesia ratings are done when the animals are being treated with L dopa.

These studies will test the effect of constant nicotine administration which may enhance the antidyskinetic effect of nicotine. Without being limited to any theory continuous nicotine application results in an initial receptor activation that is followed by receptor desensitization or inactivation that remains until the nicotine dissipates. Receptor desensitization or blockade is then thought to result in compensatory changes in striatal nAChRs with the receptor changes possibly being more pronounced depending on the period of desensitization. Thus one might expect a more sustained desensitization and receptor changes with continuous nicotine treatment.

Animal model 6 Hydroxydopamine lesioning. We used the 6 hydroxydopamine lesioned rat model of nigrostriatal damage described by Cenci and colleagues Cenci et al. 1998 Eur J Neurosci 10 2694 2706 Cenci et al. 2002 Nat Rev Neurosci 3 574 579 . Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were anesthetized with isofluorane and then placed in a Kopf stereotaxic instrument. Burr holes were drilled through the skull and an intracranial injection of 6 g 6 hydroxydopamine 2 g l stereotaxically injected at two separate sites into the right ascending dopamine fiber bundle for a total of 12 g 6 hydroxydopamine. The coordinates for the position of these two lesion sites were as follows relative to the Bregma and dural surface 1 anteroposterior 4.4 lateral 1.2 ventral 7.8 tooth bar at 2.4 2 anteroposterior 4.0 lateral 0.75 ventral 8.0 tooth bar at 3.4 Cenci et al. 1998 Eur J Neurosci 10 2694 2706 Cenci et al. 2002 Nat Rev Neurosci 3 574 579 . All procedures conformed to the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Behavioral assessment of the lesion. As an index of nigrostriatal damage the rats were tested for rotational behavior 3 and 4 weeks after lesioning. This was done using an automated behavioral measurement apparatus that has four cylindrical chambers 50 cm height 34 cm diameter ROTOMAX AccuScan Instruments Inc. Columbus Ohio USA . A rat was placed in one of the chambers for 30 min for acclimatization after which time amphetamine 4 mg kg ip was administered as previously described Visanji et al. 2006 Neuropharmacology 51 506 516 . The rats were observed for circling behavior for 90 min after injection. The rats were tested a second time one week later and the data from the two testing periods pooled.

Nicotine treatment regimen. The rats were first given a drinking solution containing 1 saccharin for 3 4 days . Nicotine was then added at a concentration of 25 g ml and increased to 50 g ml 3 4 days later. Animals were maintained on this dose for 3 weeks. L dopa treatment was then initiated as below with the nicotine dosing continued.

L dopa treatment and behavioral testing for AIMs. Rats received single daily intraperitoneal injections of 8 mg kg L dopa methyl ester plus 15 mg kg benserazide for 3 weeks as described Cenci et al. 1998 Eur J Neurosci 10 2694 2706 Cenci et al. 2002 Nat Rev Neurosci 3 574 579 . Abnormal involuntary movements AIMs after daily LDOPA injection were then quantified using the scale developed by Cenci and colleagues Cenci et al. 1998 Eur J Neurosci 10 2694 2706 Cenci et al. 2002 Nat Rev Neurosci 3 574 579 as previously done in our laboratory Cox et al. 2007 Exp. Neurol. . Rats were placed in a Rotomax test chamber. They were then scored on a scale from 0 to 4 1 occasional 2 frequent 3 continuous but interrupted by sensory distraction 4 continuous severe not interrupted by sensory distraction. The rating categories were as follows 1 axial dystonia consisting of twisting posturing of the head and neck 2 orolingual dyskinesia with stereotyped jaw movements and contralateral tongue protrusion and 3 forelimb movements with dystonic movements of the contralateral forelimb. They were also assessed for locomotive dyskinesia or increased locomotion with contralateral side bias however these scores were not included because the interpretation of this motor response is not clear Papa et al. 1994 Brain Res 662 69 74 Cenci et al. 1998 Eur J Neurosci 10 2694 2706 .

Locomotive dyskinesias are distinct from turning behavior described above. Rats were observed individually every 20 min for 3 h following L dopa treatment. The maximum possible score in each session was thus 108 maximum score per observation 12 number of observations per session 9 . Rats were evaluated by two raters one blinded to treatment.

Data analyses. Statistical significance was determined using Student s t tests or ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests as appropriate. Data are mean SEM. A p level of 0.05 was considered significant.

Nicotine treatment reduces total AIM scores. The time course of the effect of 50 g ml nicotine on the total number of AIMs after 3 weeks of L dopa treatment is shown in left panel . Each value in represents the mean SEM of 9 10 rats. p

Nicotine treatment reduces different AIM components. As indicated earlier AIMs consist of several different components including 1 axial dystonia 2 orolingual dyskinesia and 3 limb dyskinesia. Results shown are for the 3 and 6 8 week time points . Each value of represents the mean SEM of 9 10 rats p

Effect of nicotine on behavior related to parkinsonism. Our studies in monkeys showed that nicotine treatment reduced L dopa induced dyskinesias without affecting parkinsonism. In our preliminary studies in rats we found that nicotine treatment did not affect turning behavior which is used as an index of nigrostriatal damage Mabandla et al. 2004 Metab Brain Dis 19 43 50 Howells et al. 2005 Behav Brain Res 165 210 220 Steiner et al. 2006 Exp Neurol 199 291 300 . The extent of turning was quantified using the ROTOMAX AccuScan System with no difference between rats receiving saccharin 8.2 3.7 n 10 compared to nicotine 8.4 6.7 n 9 . The effect on nicotine on rotarod performance can also be tested. This is another approach used to evaluate effects of drugs on motor performance in parkinsonian rats Lundblad et al. 2003 J Neurochem 84 1398 1410 Dekundy et al. 2007 Behav Brain Res 179 76 89 .

The present data show that nicotine treatment significantly reduces L dopa induced AIMs in a 6 hydroxydopamine lesioned rat model. They demonstrate a decline in AIMs at nicotine doses of 25 and 50 g ml in the drinking water. This effect of nicotine persists with at least 2 months of L dopa treatment. These results are important as they further support the idea that nicotine may be useful for the treatment of L dopa induced dyskinesias in Parkinson s disease.

The effect of nicotinic receptor agonist such as conotoxinMII epibatidine A 85380 cytisine lobeline anabasine SIB 1508Y SIB 1553A ABT 418 ABT 594 ABT 894 TC 2403 TC 2559 RJR 2403 SSR180711 GTS 21 and varenicline can be tested using the models described in the previous examples. The effect of nicotinic receptor agonist in L dopa induced dyskinesias can be tested in the rodent model described in Example 4. The compounds can in addition be tested in a nonhuman primate model which exhibits parkinsonian symptoms and dyskinesias that closely resemble those in Parkinson s disease such as the model described in Examples 1 3. Nicotinic receptor agonist can be tested using both models. Alternatively nicotinic receptor agonist can be tested using either one of the models described herein as well as any model known in the art.

6 Hydroxydopamine lesion. Rats 30 can be first be lesioned with 6 hydroxydopamine as described in Example 4.

Behavioral assessment of the lesion. As an index of nigrostriatal damage the rats will be tested for rotational behavior two 2 weeks after the lesion. This will be done using an automated behavioral measurement apparatus. Baseline activity will be monitored for thirty 30 minutes after which time amphetamine 4 mg kg i.p. will be administered. Because amphetamine induces a greater dopamine release from the unlesioned as compared to the lesioned striatum the animals turn to the ipsilateral side. Rotation will be monitored for ninety 90 minutes. The rats will be retested one 1 week later and the results from the two 2 testing periods pooled. Rats with scores over 100 rotations will be retained for further study generally 20 25 animals out of 30 .

L dopa treatment. Rats 20 can be injected i.p. with 8 12 mg kg L dopa methyl ester plus 15 mg kg benserazide once daily for three 3 weeks and longer Cenci et al. 1998 Eur J Neurosci 10 2694 2706. Cenci et al. 2002 Nat Rev Neurosci 3 574 579 . Three 3 weeks of L dopa treatment results in the development of AIMs in the majority of rats. L dopa dosing will be started after the nicotinic agonist treatment.

Evaluation of L dopa induced AIMs. L dopa induced AIMs can be quantified as described in Example 4 Cenci et al. 1998 Eur J Neurosci 10 2694 2706. Cenci et al. 2002 Nat Rev Neurosci 3 574 579 Cox et al. 2007 Exp Neurol . This includes axial dystonia orolingual dyskinesia and forelimb movements with rats scored on a scale from 0 to 4 for each AIM component. Rats will be observed individually every twenty 20 minutes for three 3 hours following L dopa treatment. The maximum possible score in each session is thus 108 maximum score per observation 12 number of observations per session 9 . Two raters one blinded to treatment will evaluate the rats.

Nicotinic agonist regimen. The agonists can be administered 2 3 weeks prior to L dopa treatment preferably in the drinking water. The optimal dose and route of agonist administration will need to be determined prior to initiation of the experiments with lesioned animals. If this information is not available pilot studies can be done to determine optimal dosing.

Evaluation of parkinsonism. Amphetamine and L dopa induced contralateral turning will be evaluated as described above to determine the effects on parkinsonism.

Treatment. All thirty 30 rats can be first lesioned with 6 hydroxydopamine over a one 1 week period. They can be tested 2 and 3 weeks later to determine the extent of nigrostriatal damage by evaluating ipsilateral turning in response to amphetamine 20 25 rats acceptable rotation . One 1 week is usually required to evaluate turning behavior in the animals behavioral testing of 20 25 rats usually takes two 2 weeks. At week 4 Group 1 will be given vehicle e.g. saccharin only. Group 2 will be given vehicle possibly saccharin plus agonist. L dopa plus benserazide will then be administered two 2 weeks after agonist is started. AIMs are determined three 3 weeks after the start of L dopa administration. L dopa treatment will be continued throughout.

Although rats are an excellent model for screening compounds nonhuman primate studies ensure efficacy in a model that more closely resembles human Parkinson s disease. The experiments can be designed to further refine the understanding of the dosing and mode of the nicotinic receptor agonist administration that will be most effective. The non human primate model described in Examples 1 and 2 can be used to test the effect of nicotinic receptor agonist in L dopa induced dyskinesias.

The effect of continuous delivery of the nicotinic receptor agonist on L dopa induced dyskinesias can be tested via minipump as described in Example 3.

Animals. Experiments were performed using male Sprague Dawley rats initial weight 250 g purchased from Charles River Laboratories Gilroy Calif. . They were housed 2 per cage under a 12 12 h light dark cycle in a temperature controlled room with free access to food and water. Three to four days after arrival the rats were unilaterally lesioned with 6 hydroxydopamine as previously described Cenci et al. 1998 Eur J Neurosci 10 2694 2706. Cenci et al. 2002 Nat Rev Neurosci 3 574 579 . During the lesioning procedure the rats were maintained under isofluorane anesthesia 2 . They were placed in a Kopf stereotaxic instrument and burr holes drilled through the skull at the following coordinates relative to the Bregma and dural surface 1 anteroposterior 4.4 lateral 1.2 ventral 7.8 tooth bar at 2.4 2 anteroposterior 4.0 lateral 0.75 ventral 8.0 tooth bar at 3.4 Cenci et al. 1998 Eur J Neurosci 10 2694 2706. Cenci et al. 2002 Nat Rev Neurosci 3 574 579 . 6 Hydroxydopamine was dissolved in 0.02 ascorbic acid saline at a concentration of 3 ug ul. Two l was stereotaxically injected at each of these sites for a total of 12 mg into the right ascending dopamine fiber bundle. Infusion of 6 hydroxydopamine into the target area was over a 2 min period with the cannula maintained at the site of injection for a further 2 min. All procedures conformed to the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Behavioral testing. Two and three weeks after lesioning rats were tested for rotational behavior in an automated behavioral measurement apparatus ROTOMAX AccuScan Instruments Inc. Columbus Ohio USA . Each rat was placed in a cylindrical glass chamber for 30 min for acclimatization after which amphetamine 4.0 mg kg ip was administered. The behavior was monitored for an additional 90 min with rats making at least 100 ipsilateral turns used for further study.

Nicotine treatment. When the behavioral testing was completed rats were treated with nicotine via the drinking water that yields an intermittent dosing regimen or via minipump that provides a constant level of nicotine. For administration via the drinking water rats were first provided with a solution containing 1 saccharin Sigma Chemical Co. St. Louis Mo. to mask the bitter taste of nicotine. After 2 3 days of acclimation nicotine free base Sigma Chemical Co. St. Louis Mo. was added to the saccharin containing drinking solution of the treated group pH 7.0 . Nicotine was initially given at a concentration of 25 g ml nicotine for 2 days. This was subsequently increased to 50 g ml nicotine and animals maintained at this dose for several weeks . Measurement of fluid intake showed that animals with nicotine in the solution drank less than their vehicle treated counterparts in agreement with previous studies in mice. The rats appeared healthy although there was a small difference in body weight with continued dosing.

In a separate series of experiments rats were given nicotine continuously via Alzet minipumps model 2004 200 l which secrete nicotine for 28 days. These were subcutaneously implanted according to the manufacturer s instruction. Pumps were filled with either sterilized water or nicotine base in water to deliver 2 mg kg d. Body weight was similar in the rats receiving minipumps containing either vehicle or nicotine Table 4 .

L dopa treatment. Three weeks after initiation of the 50 ug ml nicotine dose the rats received single daily intraperitoneal injections of 8 mg kg L dopa methyl ester plus 15 mg kg benserazide both from Sigma Chemical Co. St. Louis Mo. Cenci et al. 1998 Eur J Neurosci 10 2694 2706. Cenci et al. 2002 Nat Rev Neurosci 3 574 579 . After 3 weeks of daily L dopa dosing abnormal involuntary movements AIMs were quantified. These included 1 axial dystonia contralateral twisted posturing of the neck and upper body 2 orolingual dyskinesia stereotyped jaw movements and contralateral tongue protrusion and 3 forelimb dyskinesia repetitive rhythmic jerks or dystonic posturing of the contralateral forelimb and or grabbing movements of the contralateral paw Cenci et al. 1998 Eur J Neurosci 10 2694 2706. Cenci et al. 2002 Nat Rev Neurosci 3 574 579 Carta et al. 2006 Neurochem 96 1718 1727 . Rats were scored on a scale from 0 to 4 for each of these three AIMs as follows 1 occasional 2 frequent 3 continuous but interrupted by sensory distraction and 4 continuous severe not interrupted by sensory distraction. Animal behavior was evaluated over 20 min sessions by two raters one blinded to treatment for 3 h following injections. This yielded a total of 9 sessions of testing per animals. The maximum possible score for each animal was thus 108 maximum score per session 9 number of sessions over 3 h 12 .

Plasma cotinine measurement. The nicotine metabolite cotinine was determined as an indirect measure of plasma nicotine levels using an ELISA kit Orasure Technologies Bethlehem Pa. . Blood samples were collected from the femoral vein after 1 to 2 wk after initiation of nicotine treatment via the drinking water or minipump. Plasma was prepared and a 

Data analyses. All analyses were done using GraphPad Prism GraphPad Software Inc San Diego Calif. . Differences in rating scores between groups were analyzed using nonparametric tests Mann Whitney Mann test or Wilcoxon test for paired data . For the time course studies analysis of variance ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple comparison test was used. A level of 0.05 was considered significant. Results are expressed as mean SEM.

An empiric trial on the effects of nicotine on levodopa induced dyskinesias can be conducted. Inclusion criteria include patients both male and female who suffered from Parkinson s disease that are 30 years old and older.

This study can be a multi center double blind placebo controlled multiple dose escalating safety tolerance pharmacokinetics and efficacy study of nicotine administered in Parkinson s disease patients who are concomitantly being treated with a combination product of levodopa and possible other antiparkinson medication. The patients will be randomized into one of five treatment groups to receive either fixed or ascending doses of Nicotine from 0.3 to 4 mg per dose or placebo. For efficacy assessments the patient is assessed with levodopa challenge following an overnight withdrawal of Parkinson s medication. Levodopa induced dyskinesia is assessed using a standardized rating scale.
