The present application is a continuation in part of PCT International Application PCT US2007 007724 filed Mar. 27 2007 which claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application 60 786 746 filed Mar. 27 2006 both of which applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

This invention was funded by the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.

Cancer in all its manifestations remains a devastating disorder. Although cancer is commonly considered to be a single disease it actually comprises a family of diseases wherein normal cell differentiation is modified so that it becomes abnormal and uncontrolled. As a result these malignant cells rapidly proliferate. Eventually the cells spread or metastasize from their origin and colonize other organs eventually killing their host. Due to the wide variety of cancers presently observed numerous strategies have been developed to destroy cancer within the body.

Typically cancer is treated by chemotherapy in which highly toxic chemicals are given to the patient or by radiotherapy in which toxic doses of radiation are directed at the patient. Unfortunately these cytotoxic treatments also kill extraordinary numbers of healthy cells causing the patient to experience acute debilitating symptoms including nausea diarrhea hypersensitivity to light hair loss etc. The side effects of these cytotoxic compounds limits the frequency and dosage at which they can be administered. Such disabling side effects can be mitigated to some degree by using compounds that selectively target cycling cells i.e. interfering with DNA replication or other growth processes in cells that are actively reproducing. Since cancer cells are characterized by their extraordinary ability to proliferate such protocols preferentially kill a larger proportion of cancer cells in comparison to healthy cells but cytotoxicity and ancillary sickness remains a problem.

Another strategy for controlling cancer involves the use of signal transduction pathways in malignant cells to turn off their uncontrolled proliferation or alternatively instruct such cells to undergo apoptosis. Such methods of treating cancer are promising but a substantial amount of research is needed in order to make these methods viable alternatives.

The treatment and or cure of cancer has been intensely investigated culminating in a wide range of therapies. Cancer has been typically treated with surgery radiation and chemotherapy alone or in conjunction with various therapies employing drugs biologic agents antibodies and radioactive immunoconjugates among others. The common goal of cancer treatment has been and continues to be the elimination or amelioration of cancerous tumors and cells with minimal unpleasant or life threatening side effects due to toxicity to normal tissues and cells. However despite efforts these goals remain largely unmet.

Tetracycline and a number of its chemical relatives have been used as antibiotics. The parent compound tetracycline has the following general structure 

Tetracycline as well as the 5 OH terramycin and 7 Cl aureomycin derivatives exist in nature and are all well known antibiotics. Semisynthetic derivatives such as 7 dimethylamino tetracycline minocycline and 6 deoxy 5 hydroxy tetracycline doxycycline are also known antibiotics.

However changes to the basic structure of the ring system or replacement of substituents at positions 1 4 or 10 12 generally lead to synthetic tetracyclines with substantially less or essentially no antibacterial activity. For example 4 de dimethylamino tetracycline is commonly considered to be a non antibacterial tetracycline.

Tetracycline compounds affect protein synthesis and appear to have anti inflammatory properties in addition to their anti microbial properties which are useful for treatment of arthritis. The anti inflammatory activity of tetracycline compounds make them useful for treating other inflammatory disorders even in the absence of an infectious agent. Tetracycline compounds can inhibit enzymes associated with inflammatory diseases such as matrix metalloproteases MMPs collagenase gelatinase and elastase. While it is widely thought that tetracycline compounds decrease enzyme activity by chelation they may also decrease inflammation by decreasing production of proinflammatory or other compounds. Tetracycline compounds may be effective when used with other compounds in the treatment of inflammatory conditions.

More recently it has been established that tetracyclines which are rapidly absorbed and have a prolonged plasma half life exert biological effects independent of their antimicrobial activity Golub et al. 1991 Golub et al. 1992 Uitto et al. 1994 . Such effects include inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases abbreviated MMPs including collagenases MMP 1 MMP 8 MMP 13 and gelatinases MMP 2 MMP 9 as well as prevention of pathologic tissue destruction Golub et al. 1991 .

In view of the above considerations it is clear that there is a need to supplement existing methods of inhibiting cancer cell invasiveness and metastasis. Current approaches rely on highly cytotoxic compounds that cause ancillary debilitating sickness in patients or use methodology that is expensive procedurally difficult and unpredictable.

Accordingly it is one of the purposes of this invention to overcome the above limitations in cancer treatment by providing a compound and method for inhibiting the growth processes characteristic of cancer cells including inhibiting invasiveness and metastasis as well as inducing regression of primary tumors. In particular it is desirable to identify anticancer compounds and methods that inhibit cancer growth specifically and with relatively high activity i.e. being active at doses that are substantially free of harmful side effects. Additionally it is a purpose of the invention to provide methods and compositions suitable for the development identification and or characterization of compounds that are capable of modulating the activity of tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterases TDPs particularly tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase 1 TDP1 . The present invention provides means to identify and characterize compounds that are suitable for inhibiting TDP activity in vivo and in vitro.

In certain aspects the invention provides a method of inhibiting Tdp1 activity in a subject the method comprising administering to the subject a tetracycline compound capable of modulating the activity of Tdp1. In one embodiment the invention provides a method of inhibiting Tdp1 activity wherein the tetracycline compound is a compound of formula I

Tumors or neoplasms include new growths of tissue in which the multiplication of cells is uncontrolled and progressive. Some such growths are benign but others are termed malignant leading to death of the organism. Malignant neoplasms or cancers are distinguished from benign growths in that in addition to exhibiting aggressive cellular proliferation they invade surrounding tissues and metastasize. Moreover malignant neoplasms are characterized in that they show a greater loss of differentiation greater dedifferentiation and of their organization relative to one another and their surrounding tissues. This property is also called anaplasia. 

Neoplasms treatable by the present invention include all solid tumors i.e. carcinomas and sarcomas including Kaposi s sarcoma. Carcinomas include those malignant neoplasms derived from epithelial cells which tend to infiltrate invade the surrounding tissues and give rise to metastases. Adenocarcinomas are carcinomas derived from glandular tissue or in which the tumor cells form recognizable glandular structures. Sarcoma including Kaposi s sarcoma broadly include tumors whose cells are embedded in a fibrillar or homogeneous substance like embryonic connective tissue.

The invention is particularly illustrated herein in reference to treatment of certain types of experimentally defined cancers. In these illustrative treatments standard state of the art in vitro and in vivo models have been used. These methods can be used to identify agents that can be expected to be efficacious in in vivo treatment regimens. However it will be understood that the method of the invention is not limited to the treatment of these tumor types but extends to any solid tumor derived from any organ system. Cancers whose invasiveness or metastasis is associated with MMP expression particularly gelatinase expression are especially susceptible to being inhibited or even induced to regress by means of the invention.

Thus the treatable cancers include for example colon cancer bladder cancer breast cancer melanoma ovarian carcinoma prostatic carcinoma or lung cancer and a variety of other cancers as well. The invention is especially useful in the inhibition of cancer growth in adenocarcinomas including for example those of the prostate breast kidney ovary testes and colon. The invention is further useful against melanomas which derive from the melanocytic system in the skin and other organs.

A solid tumor can be malignant e.g. tending to metastasize and being life threatening or benign. Examples of solid tumors that can be treated according to a method of the present invention include sarcomas and carcinomas such as but not limited to fibrosarcoma myxosarcoma liposarcoma chondrosarcoma osteogenic sarcoma chordoma angiosarcoma endotheliosarcoma lymphangiosarcoma lymphangioendotheliosarcoma synovioma mesothelioma Ewing s tumor leiomyosarcoma rhabdomyosarcoma colon carcinoma pancreatic cancer breast cancer ovarian cancer prostate cancer squamous cell carcinoma basal cell carcinoma adenocarcinoma sweat gland carcinoma sebaceous gland carcinoma papillary carcinoma papillary adenocarcinomas cystadenocarcinoma medullary carcinoma bronchogenic carcinoma renal cell carcinoma hepatoma bile duct carcinoma choriocarcinoma seminoma embryonal carcinoma Wilms tumor cervical cancer testicular tumor lung carcinoma small cell lung carcinoma bladder carcinoma epithelial carcinoma glioma astrocytoma medulloblastoma craniopharyngioma ependymoma pinealoma hemangioblastoma acoustic neuroma oligodendroglioma meningioma melanoma neuroblastoma and retinoblastoma.

Moreover tumors comprising dysproliferative changes such as metaplasias and dysplasias are treated or prevented in epithelial tissues such as those in the cervix esophagus and lung. Thus the present invention provides for treatment of conditions known or suspected of preceding progression to neoplasia or cancer in particular where non neoplastic cell growth consisting of hyperplasia metaplasia or most particularly dysplasia has occurred for review of such abnormal growth conditions see Robbins and Angell 1976 Basic Pathology 2d Ed. W. B. Saunders Co. Philadelphia pp. 68 79 . Hyperplasia is a form of controlled cell proliferation involving an increase in cell number in a tissue or organ without significant alteration in structure or function. As but one example endometrial hyperplasia often precedes endometrial cancer. Metaplasia is a form of controlled cell growth in which one type of adult or fully differentiated cell substitutes for another type of adult cell. Metaplasia can occur in epithelial or connective tissue cells. Atypical metaplasia involves a somewhat disorderly metaplastic epithelium. Dysplasia is frequently a forerunner of cancer and is found mainly in the epithelia it is the most disorderly form of non neoplastic cell growth involving a loss in individual cell uniformity and in the architectural orientation of cells. Dysplastic cells often have abnormally large deeply stained nuclei and exhibit pleomorphism. Dysplasia characteristically occurs where there exists chronic irritation or inflammation and is often found in the cervix respiratory passages oral cavity and gall bladder. For a review of such disorders see Fishman et al. 1985 Medicine 2d Ed. J. B. Lippincott Co. Philadelphia.

Other examples of tumors that are benign and can be treated with a method of the present invention include arteriovenous AV malformations particularly in intracranial sites and myoleomas. A method of the present invention may also be used to treat psoriasis a dermatologic condition that is characterized by inflammation and vascular proliferation benign prostatic hypertrophy a condition associated with inflammation and possibly vascular proliferation and cutaneous fungal infections. Treatment of other hyperprobiferative disorders is also contemplated.

In certain embodiments the present invention is directed to a method for inhibiting cancer growth including processes of cellular proliferation invasiveness and metastasis in biological systems. The method includes the use of a tetracycline compound as an inhibitor of cancer growth. Preferably the method is employed to inhibit or reduce cancer cell proliferation invasiveness metastasis or tumor incidence in living animals such as mammals.

The invention includes a method of inducing cytotoxicity cell killing in cancer cells or reducing the viability of cancer cells. For example the invention can be used to induce cytotoxicity in cells of carcinomas of the prostate breast ovary testis lung colon or breast. The selective killing of the cancer cells can occur through apoptosis necrosis another mechanism or a combination of mechanisms.

The killing of cancer cells can occur with less cytotoxicity to normal cells or tissues than is found with conventional cytotoxic therapeutics preferably without substantial cytotoxicity to normal cells or tissues. For example a tetracycline e.g. CMT 3 can induce cytotoxicity in cancer cells while producing little or substantially no cytotoxicity in normal cells. Thus unlike conventional cytotoxic anticancer therapeutics which typically kill all growing cells CMT 3 can produce differential cytotoxicity tumor cells are selectively killed whereas normal cells are spared. Thus in another embodiment the invention is a method for inducing differential cytotoxicity in cancer cells relative to normal cells or tissue. This differential in cytotoxicity associated with the tetracycline compounds occurs as a result of apoptosis necrosis another mechanism or a combination of such mechanisms.

The tetracycline compounds exhibit their cancer treatment properties at concentrations that lead to fewer side effects than those of known chemotherapeutic agents and in some cases are substantially free of side effects. The tetracycline compounds are useful for extended treatment protocols where other compounds would exhibit undesirable side effects. In addition it is believed that the properties of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity are well balanced in these compounds enhancing their utility both in vitro and especially in vivo while other compounds lacking such balance are of substantially less utility. Specifically the compounds have an appropriate degree of solubility in aqueous media to permit absorption and bioavailability in the body while also having a degree of solubility in lipids to permit traversal of the cell membrane to a putative site of action. The compounds are maximally effective if they can be delivered to the site of the tumor and are able to enter the tumor cells.

In the treatment of certain localized cancers the degree of hydrophilicity of the tetracycline compound can be of lesser importance. Such compounds as tetracyclinonitrile CMT 2 which has low solubility in aqueous systems can be used in direct or topical treatment of skin cancers e.g. melanoma or basal cell carcinoma or by implantation into the brain to topically treat brain cancer.

The tetracycline compounds are effective to inhibit the proliferation invasiveness or metastasis of cancer cells in vitro as well as in vivo. These compounds possess an excellent balance of properties in that they are shown to possess unusually strong activity in inhibiting the cancer growth including proliferation invasiveness or metastasis of cancer cells. Another advantage is that it has an unexpectedly long serum half life approximately 28 hr . Therefore certain tetracyclines may only require periodic administration e.g. once or twice per week.

In another embodiment the method of the invention is effective to inhibit the enzymatic activity of matrix metalloproteinases such as collagenases and gelatinases associated with cancerous tumors in mammals. The gelatinolytic activity capable of inhibition may derive from gelatinase expression by the cancerous tumor or from normal i.e. non cancerous tissue. In particular the gelatinase activity may be derived from such normal tissues as epithelial tissue or stromal tissue. More preferably the method can be used to inhibit excessive gelatinolytic activity associated with such tumors. This inhibition of observed gelatinolytic activity may be due to inhibition of MMP activity down regulation of MMP expression or some other interference with the physiology associated with these gelatinases such as inhibition of activation of the precursor form of the enzyme pro gelatinase or pro MMP .

The inhibition of cancer cells may result from inhibition of MMP activity down regulation of MMP expression some other mechanism or a combination of mechanisms. It is believed that all solid cancer types that express MMPs or that exhibit invasive or metastatic properties can be treated by the method of the invention. In some cases the incidence or development of tumor foci can be inhibited or substantially prevented from occurring. Therefore the method can be used as a prophylactic treatment e.g. by administering the tetracycline compound to a mammal after detection of a gene product or metabolite associated with predisposition to a cancer but before any specific cancerous lesion is detected. Alternatively the tetracycline compounds are useful for preventing cancer recurrence for example to treat residual cancer following surgical resection or radiation therapy.

The effect occurs over a wide range of concentrations including at concentrations that are extraordinarily low. The amount of the tetracycline compound used according to the invention is an amount that is effectively inhibitory of cancer growth. An amount of a tetracycline compound is effectively inhibitory to cancer growth if it significantly reduces cellular proliferation or the potential of invasiveness or metastasis. Proliferation refers to the capacity of a tumor to increase its volume through cell division typically measured as the doubling rate. The inhibition of cellular proliferation by the present method means that the rate of growth is decreased. In some cases the method can actually induce regression or diminution of tumor mass if the rate of replenishment of the tumor cells through cell division is exceeded by the rate of cell death. Invasiveness refers to the potential of a tumor or tumor cells to invade other tissues typically by breaking down the extracellular matrix of those tissues. Metastasis refers to the potential of a tumor or tumor cells to establish new tumor foci at sites distant from the primary site where the tumor began. Typically metastasis proceeds by individual cells or groups of cells breaking off from the primary tumor and migrating e.g. through the blood or lymph to establish a new tumor focus in another tissue or organ. One locus common in tumor metastasis is in the lung where the very fine vasculature of the lung tissue can often catch circulating tumor cells permitting the establishment of a tumor focus therein. Some types of tumors metastasize to specific types of tissues.

The cancers treatable by means of the present invention occur in mammals. Mammals include for example humans as well as pet animals such as dogs and cats laboratory animals such as rats and mice and farm animals such as horses and cows.

Human cancers are characterized by genomic instability which leads to the accumulation of DNA lesions. Hence tumor cells are highly dependent on normal repair for survival.

DNA topoisomerase I Top1 is ubiquitous and essential in higher eukaryotes. It relieves DNA torsional stress and relaxes DNA supercoiling by introducing DNA single strand breaks. Top1 can be trapped by DNA lesions that accumulate in cancer cells. Top1 is also the target of the anticancer agent camptothecin and non camptothecin inhibitors. Top1 inhibitors damage DNA by trapping covalent complexes between the Top1 catalytic tyrosine and the 3 end of the broken DNA. Tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase Tdp1 repairs Top1 DNA covalent complexes by hydrolyzing the tyrosyl DNA bond.

Tdp1 inhibitors are therefore useful as anticancer agents both in monotherapy and in combination with other anticancer compounds particularly DNA targeted anticancer compounds such as Top1 inhibitors. Tumor cells whose repair pathways are commonly deficient might be selectively sensitized to Top1 inhibitors compared to normal cells that contain redundant repair pathways. Moreover Tdp1 inhibitors might also be effective by themselves as anticancer agents as oncogenic activation tends to increase free radical production and genomic instability Cerutti Pa. 1985 227 4685 375 381 Kc S et al. . 2006 29 593 1 2 64 79.

In another aspect the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions including a Tdp1 inhibitor of this invention together with a TopI inhibitor optionally including a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient.

In another aspect the invention provides methods and compositions for the treatment or prevention of parasitic disease. Tdp1 inhibitors may be valuable as anti infectious agents since the gene is present in parasites including and spp. including and .

The phrase pharmaceutically acceptable refers to those compounds of the present invention compositions containing such compounds and or dosage forms which are within the scope of sound medical judgment suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity irritation allergic response or other problem or complication commensurate with a reasonable benefit risk ratio.

The phrase pharmaceutically acceptable carrier includes pharmaceutically acceptable material composition or vehicle involved in carrying or transporting the subject chemical from one organ or portion of the body to another organ or portion of the body. Each carrier must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not injurious to the patient.

A therapeutically effective amount can be administered in one or more doses. The term administration or administering includes routes of introducing the compound s to a subject to perform their intended function. Examples of routes of administration which can be used include injection subcutaneous intravenous parenterally intraperitoneally intrathecal oral inhalation rectal and transdermal.

The phrases parenteral administration and administered parenterally as used herein means modes of administration other than enteral and topical administration usually by injection and includes without limitation intravenous intramuscular intraarterial intrathecal intracapsular intraorbital intracardiac intradermal intraperitoneal transtracheal subcutaneous subcuticular intraarticulare subcapsular subarachnoid intraspinal and intrasternal injection and infusion.

The phrases systemic administration administered systemically peripheral administration and administered peripherally as used herein mean the administration of a compound s drug or other material such that it enters the patient s system and thus is subject to metabolism and other like processes for example subcutaneous administration.

Methods of preparing these compositions include the step of bringing into association a compound s with the carrier and optionally one or more accessory ingredients. These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives wetting agents emulsifying agents and dispersing agents.

In some cases in order to prolong the effect of a drug it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility. Alternatively delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.

Regardless of the route of administration selected the compound s which may be used in a suitable hydrated form and or the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are formulated into pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to those of skill in the art.

In certain embodiments the pharmaceutical compositions are suitable for topical intravenous intratumoral parental or oral administration. The methods of the invention further include administering to a subject a therapeutically effective amount of a conjugate in combination with another pharmaceutically active compound. Pharmaceutically active compounds that may be used can be found in Thirteenth Edition Eds. T. R. Harrison et al. McGraw Hill N.Y. NY and the Physicians Desk Reference 50th Edition 1997 Oradell N.J. Medical Economics Co. the complete contents of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference.

Formulations are provided to a subject in an effective amount. The term effective amount includes an amount effective at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired result. An effective amount of conjugate may vary according to factors such as the disease state age and weight of the subject and the ability of the compound to elicit a desired response in the subject. Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response.

The effective amount is generally determined by the physician on a case by case basis and is within the skill of one in the art. As a rule the dosage for in vivo therapeutics or diagnostics will vary. Several factors are typically taken into account when determining an appropriate dosage. These factors include age sex and weight of the patient the condition being treated and the severity of the condition.

Suitable dosages and formulations of immune modulators can be empirically determined by the administering physician. Standard texts such as Remington The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 17th edition Mack Publishing Company and the Physician s Desk Reference each of which are incorporated herein by reference can be consulted to prepare suitable compositions and doses for administration. A determination of the appropriate dosage is within the skill of one in the art given the parameters for use described herein. Standard texts such as Remington The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 17th edition Mack Publishing Company incorporated herein by reference can be consulted to prepare suitable compositions and formulations for administration without undue experimentation. Suitable dosages can also be based upon the text and documents cited herein. A determination of the appropriate dosages is within the skill of one in the art given the parameters herein.

In terms of treatment an effective amount is an amount that is sufficient to palliate ameliorate stabilize reverse or slow the progression of a cancerous disease or otherwise reduce the pathological consequences of the cancer. A therapeutically effective amount can be provided in one or a series of administrations. The effective amount is generally determined by the physician on a case by case basis and is within the skill of one in the art.

As a rule the dosage for in vivo therapeutics or diagnostics will vary. Several factors are typically taken into account when determining an appropriate dosage. These factors include age sex and weight of the patient the condition being treated the severity of the condition and the form of the compound being administered.

Ascertaining dosage ranges is well within the skill of one in the art. The dosage of conjugates can range from about 0.001 g kg day to about 500 mg kg day. Methods for administering compositions are known in the art. Such dosages may vary for example depending on whether multiple administrations are given tissue type and route of administration the condition of the individual the desired objective and other factors known to those of skill in the art. Administrations can be conducted infrequently or on a regular weekly basis until a desired measurable parameter is detected such as diminution of disease symptoms. Administration can then be diminished such as to a biweekly or monthly basis as appropriate.

Such dosages may vary for example depending on whether multiple administrations are given tissue type and route of administration the condition of the individual the desired objective and other factors known to those of skill in the art.

Following administration of the composition it can be necessary to wait for the composition to reach an effective tissue concentration at the site of the disorder before detection. Duration of the waiting step varies depending on factors such as route of administration location and speed of movement in the body. In addition where the compositions are coupled to molecular carriers the rate of uptake can vary depending on the level of receptor expression on the surface of the cells. For example where there is a high level of receptor expression the rate of binding and uptake is increased. Determining a useful range of waiting step duration is within the level of ordinary skill in the art and may be optimized.

The tetracycline compounds useful according to the method of the invention appear to exhibit their beneficial effect in a dose dependent manner. Thus within broad limits administration of larger quantities of a tetracycline compound has been observed to inhibit cancer cell growth or invasiveness to a greater degree than does administration of a smaller amount. Moreover efficacy has been observed at dosages below the level at which toxicity is seen in normal cells or at the organismal level. Accordingly one of the advantages of the invention is that the debilitating side effects usually attendant upon conventional cytotoxic cancer treatments are reduced and preferably avoided.

Available routes of administration include subcutaneous intramuscular intraperitoneal intradermal oral intranasal intrapulmonary i.e. by aerosol intravenously intramuscularly subcutaneously intracavity intrathecally or transdermally alone or in combination with other pharmaceutical agents.

Compositions for oral intranasal or topical administration can be supplied in solid semi solid or liquid forms including tablets capsules powders liquids and suspensions. Compositions for injection can be supplied as liquid solutions or suspensions as emulsions or as solid forms suitable for dissolution or suspension in liquid prior to injection. For administration via the respiratory tract a preferred composition is one that provides a solid powder or liquid aerosol when used with an appropriate aerosolizer device. Although not required compositions are preferably supplied in unit dosage form suitable for administration of a precise amount. Also contemplated by this invention are slow release or sustained release forms whereby a relatively consistent level of the active compound are provided over an extended period.

Another method of administration is intravascular for instance by direct injection into the blood vessel or surrounding area. Further it may be desirable to administer the compositions locally to the area in need of treatment this can be achieved for example by local infusion during surgery by injection by means of a catheter or by means of an implant said implant being of a porous non porous or gelatinous material including membranes such as silastic membranes or fibers.

Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice of the present invention preferred methods and materials are described above. The materials methods and examples are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting. Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the detailed description and from the claims.

Enteral administration is a preferred route of delivery of the tetracycline and compositions including the tetracycline compound with appropriate diluents carriers and the like are readily formulated. Liquid or solid e.g. tablets gelatin capsules formulations can be employed. It is among the advantages of the invention that in many situations the tetracycline compound can be delivered orally as opposed to parenteral delivery e.g. injection infusion which is typically required with conventional chemotherapeutic agents.

Parenteral use e.g. intravenous intramuscular subcutaneous injection is also contemplated and formulations using conventional diluents carriers etc. such as are known in the art can be employed to deliver the compound.

Alternatively delivery of the tetracycline compound can include topical application. Compositions deemed to be suited for such topical use include as gels salves lotions ointments and the like. In the case of tumors having foci inside the body e.g. brain tumors the tetracycline compound can be delivered via a slow release delivery vehicle e.g. a polymeric material surgically implanted at or near the lesion situs.

The maximal dosage for a subject is the highest dosage that does not cause undesirable or intolerable side effects. For the purpose of the present invention side effects may include clinically significant antimicrobial or antibacterial activity as well as toxic effects. The practitioner is guided by skill and knowledge in the field and the present invention includes without limitation dosages that are effective to achieve the described phenomena.

The invention can also be practiced by including with the tetracycline compound one or more other anti cancer chemotherapeutic agents such as any conventional chemotherapeutic agent. The combination of the tetracycline compound with such other agents can potentiate the chemotherapeutic protocol. Numerous chemotherapeutic protocols will present themselves in the mind of the skilled practitioner as being capable of incorporation into the method of the invention. Any chemotherapeutic agent can be used including alkylating agents antimetabolites hormones and antagonists radioisotopes as well as natural products. For example the non anti microbial tetracycline compound can be administered with antibiotics such as doxorubicin and other anthracycline analogs nitrogen mustards such as cyclophosphamide pyrimidine analogs such as 5 fluorouracil cisplatin hydroxyurea taxol and its natural and synthetic derivatives and the like. As another example in the case of mixed tumors such as adenocarcinomas of the breast and prostate in which the tumors can include gonadotropin dependent and gonadotropin independent cells the tetracycline can be administered in conjunction with leuprolide or goserelin synthetic peptide analogs of LH RH . Other antineoplastic protocols include the use of a tetracycline compound with another treatment modality e.g. surgery radiation other chemotherapeutic agent etc. referred to herein as adjunct antineoplastic modalities. Thus the method of the invention can be employed with such conventional regimens with the benefit of reducing side effects and enhancing efficacy.

Preparation of Tdp1 substrates HPLC purified oligonucleotides N14Y Plo et al. 2003 2 10 1087 1100 were labeled at their 5 end with P ATP Perkin Elmer Life Science Co. Boston Mass. by incubation with 3 phosphatase free T4 polynucleotide kinase Roche applied Science Indianapolis Ind. according to the manufacturer s protocols. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by Sephadex G 25 spin column chromatography Mini Quick Spin Oligo Columns Roche Indianapolis Ind. . For the production of the oligonucleotide duplexes D14Y N14Y was mixed with the complementary oligonucleotide in equal molar ratios in annealing buffer 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 100 mM NaCl 10 mM MgCl heated to 96 C. and allowed to cool down slowly over 2 h to room temperature.

Assay Unless indicated otherwise Tdp1 assays were performed in 20 l mixtures containing 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 80 mM KCl 2 mM EDTA 1 mM dithiothreitol DTT and 40 g ml bovine serum albumin BSA . For initial screening of Tdp1 inhibitors 25 nM of 5 P labeled substrate D14Y was reacted with 1 ng Tdp1 0.7 nM in the absence or presence of inhibitor for 20 min at 25 C. Reactions were stopped by addition of 60 l of gel loading buffer 98 v v formamide 1 w v xylene cyanol 1 w v bromophenol blue . Twelve l of aliquots were resolved in 20 denaturing polyacrylamide AccuGel National Diagnostics Atlanta Ga. 19 1 gel containing 7 M urea. After drying gels were exposed overnight to PhosphorImager screens Molecular Dynamics Sunnyvale Calif. . Screens were scanned and images were obtained with the Molecular Dynamics software Sunnyvale Calif. . Densitometry analyses were performed using ImageQuant 5.2 software package Amersham Biosciences Piscataway N.J. . Tdp1 activity was determined by measuring the fraction of substrate converted into 3 phosphate DNA product by densitometry analysis of the gel image Debethune et al. 2002 . Figures show representative results that were consistently reproduced at least three times.

Tdp1 inhibitors have become a major area of drug research and structure based design with Tdp1 works synergistically and selectively in the cancer cells. Tdp1 can repair DNA topoisomerase I Top1 covalent complexes by hydrolyzing the tyrosyl DNA phosphodiester bond. The natural substrate of Tdp1 is large and complex consisting of tyrosine or possibly a tyrosine containing peptide moiety linked to a single strand of DNA via a 3 phosphodiester bond Interthal H. Pouliot J. J. 98 21 2001 . In the present study in order to determine how the inhibitors may be binding with the active site of Tdp1 N domain we report docking the inhibitors into a structural model of Tdp1 enzyme based on a multiple crystal structures of Tdp1 substrate complex with resolution 2.0 acute over or better inhibitors to obtain information about their preferred conformations and their potential binding interactions with the Tdp1 and Top1 N terminal domain.

Computational modeling was performed using Glide software Schrodinger Inc. on a Silicon Graphics workstation. All minimizations and docking were performed with the OPLS2003 force field. The dimmer complex with peptide 1NOP Davies D. R. Champoux J. J. 324 917 932 2002 1RFF Davies D. R. et al. . 10 139 2003 and with octopamine 1RHO Davies D. R. et al. 47 829 2004 were used. Chain A from the crystal structure of Top 1 and Tdp1 bound to the NT domain was used as the starting geometry for the modeling study. The model was built from an x ray crystal structure of the complexes 1NOP 1RFF 1RHO using the Maestro 7.5.

Eight crystal structures shown in Table 1 Davies D. R. et al. 47 829 2004 of Tdp1 with vanadate oligonucleotides and peptides or peptide analogues were determined. Those eight complex include peptides of varying length and sequence non peptide analogues of tyrosine and oligonucleotides of varying length of sequence. The conformations of the 8WT Top 1 peptide and eight other crystallographic peptides in vanadate complex with Tdp1 are significantly different from the conformation of the corresponding residues in the crystal structures of Top 1 bound to DNA 1NOP Davies D. R. et al. 10 237 2002 

The two dimensional structures of Compounds a and b were minimized before analyzing the interactions between the ligand and the receptor. The compounds were optimized using the OPLS2003 force field using a PRCG to convergence and a distance dependent dielectric constant of 1 for the electrostatic treatment. Minimization was done using conjugate gradient minimization. Maximum number of cycles was set to 1000 gradient criteria 0.001. The complex was modeled in the N terminal domain. The ligand compounds were docked by standard precision SP and with option dock flexibly which allow flips of 5 and 6 member rings. The best poses of compounds were finally selected based on the docking score Emodel and the interactions made by the compounds with the active site of Tdp1.

The results are shown in . The docking analysis indicate that in the best poses of Compound a without substrate the amine group Hydrogen bonds to residue SER 608 1NOP hydrogen atom of imine group to His 493 1RFF nitrogen atom by C20 contacts with polar hydrogen atom of T 806 of oligonucleotide 1RHO and in the best poses of Compound a with substrate oxygen atom of hydroxyl group by C10 and carbonyl group by C11 HBonds to GLY 260 oxygen atom of hydroxyl group by C12 to LYS 720 1RFF and the hydrogen atom of hydroxyl group by C12a of NSC 118695 HBonds to PRO 461 1RHO . In case of Compound b without substrate hydrogen atom of amine group HBonds to N3 of His 493 1RHO nitrogen atom of imine group contacts with T 806 1RHO while in crystal structure oxygen atom of VO4 bonds to T 806 of oligonucleotide. When the substrate is present in the active site the amine group contacts with N3 and C4 of His 263 1NOP substituent in position 3 contacts with TYR 723 1RFF hydrogen atom of amine group contacts to N3 of His 263 1RHO . The binding model obtained for compound Compound a did not show some critical interactions with active sites of Tdp1 N domain. The docking scores correlated poorly with enzyme inhibitory activity so other approaches were tried to quantify the docked poses. One main reason for the failure to get a good docking mode could be attributed to the size of the molecules and the number of rotatable bonds 13 for Compound a and only 4 for Compound b .

The results obtained in Examples 2 and 3 are used to refine a model for prediction of binding affinity of compounds against Tdp1 as follows. Virtual screening method of compounds obtained from e.g. the NCI databases such as ChemNavigator based on the biological activity data of confirmed 34 compounds active in the low micromolar range. The obtained compounds will then be subjected to flexible docking as described above and compounds are selected based on the docking score for the Energy of the Model. The results are compared with a training set of compounds found to bind to the active site of Tdp1.

Tween 20 KCl fluorescein isothiocyanate FITC and PBS were procured from Sigma Aldrich. DMSO certified ACS grade was obtained from Fisher. The AlphaScreen FITC streptavidin detection kit was from PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences Waltham Mass. . Assay buffer consisted of PBS pH 7.4 80 mM KCl and 0.05 Tween 20. Recombinant Tdp1 was expressed and purified as described elsewhere Antony et al. 35 4474 4484 2007 . The Sigma Aldrich LOPAClibrary of 1280 known bioactives was received as DMSO solutions at initial concentration of 10 mM and plated as described elsewhere Inglese et al. 103 11473 11478 2006 Yasgar et al. 13 78 89 2008 .

The biotinylated phosphotyrosine deoxyoligonucleotide 5 biotin GATCTAAAAGACTT pY was synthesized purified and QC tested by Midland Certified Reagent Company Midland Tex. Standard overnight 4 C. FITC coupling was performed in house. The FITC labeled substrate was purified on Biospin 6 desalting columns Bio Rad Hercules Calif. and its concentration was determined by UV vis spectrophotometry.

Assay reaction mixtures and substrate beads titrations were initially performed at 20 l final volume in 384 well plates. For the subsequent 1 536 well based experiments Flying Reagent Dispenser FRD Aurora Discovery presently Beckman Coulter was used to dispense reagents into the assay plates while a pintool was used to deliver DMSO solutions of the test inhibitors. Plates were read on Envision plate reader PerkinElmer equipped with AlphaScreen optical detection module. For testing the effect of enzyme reaction conditions on the ICvalues for select inhibitors the respective compounds were prepared as 24 point twofold intra plate dilution series and assayed as described.

Three l of reagents buffer in columns 3 and 4 as negative control and 1.33 nM Tdp1 in columns 1 2 5 48 were dispensed into 1 536 well black solid bottom plate. Compounds final concentrations in the range of 0.7 nM to 57 M were transferred via Kalypsys pintool equipped with 1 536 pin array. The plate was incubated for 15 min at room temperature and then 1 l of substrate 15 nM final concentration was added to start the reaction. After 5 min incubation at room temperature 1 l of bead mix 15 g mL final concentration was added and the plate was further incubated for 10 min at room temperature prior to signal measurement. Substrate and beads were prepared and kept in amber bottles to prevent photo degradation. Library plates were screened starting from the lowest and proceeding to the highest concentration. Vehicle only plates with DMSO being pin transferred to the entire column 5 48 compound area were included at the beginning and the end of the screen in order to record any systematic shifts in assay signal. Screening data were corrected normalized and curve fitted by using in house developed algorithms.

One nanomolar of 5 P labeled substrate N14Y 5 GATCTAAAAGACTT Tyrosine 3 was incubated with 0.1 nM recombinant Tdp1 in the absence or presence of inhibitor for 20 min at 25 C. in a reaction buffer containing 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 80 mM KCl 2 mM EDTA and 40 g ml BSA. Reactions were terminated by the addition of one volume of gel loading buffer 96 v v formamide 10 mM EDTA 1 w v xylene cyanol and 1 w v bromphenol blue . The samples were subsequently heated to 95 C. for 5 min and subjected to 20 denaturing PAGE. When the Tdp1 mutant H493R 100 nM was employed the reactions were stopped with one volume of SDS loading dye and analyzed by 4 20 SDS PAGE. All gels were dried and exposed on a PhosphorImager screen. Imaging and quantification were done using a Typhoon 8600 and ImageQuant software GE Healthcare Piscataway N.J. .

To configure an assay for Tdp1 we utilized the ability of the AlphaScreen system to report on the integrity of the phosphotyrosine based substrate viewed here as a multi site analyte. The AlphaScreen signal is a direct consequence of the close proximity of donor and acceptor beads which is achieved by the formation of a ternary donor analyte acceptor recognition complex. To realize the AlphaScreen assay using the consensus DNA pY substrate for Tdp1 5 GATCTAAAAGACTTpY recognition elements for both bead types had to be introduced. To this end we coupled a fluorescein isothiocyanate FITC to the amino group of tyrosine in a phosphotyrosine containing single stranded DNA substrate bearing a biotin at its 5 end. Thus intact substrate when mixed with streptavidin donor and anti FITC antibody acceptor beads was expected to yield a high AlphaScreen signal while the Tdp1 catalyzed substrate hydrolysis would result in a decreased signal. Conversely if the Tdp1 catalysis was inhibited an elevated signal would be observed for that sample.

In a 384 well plate the addition of an equimolar mix of anti FITC acceptor and streptavidin donor AlphaScreen beads to FITC DNA substrate generated a strong signal while omission of substrate resulted in background readings. The concentration response curve of the FITC DNA substrate titrated against constant bead concentration exhibited a maximum around 15 nM followed by a signal decrease to background levels as the substrate concentration was further increased. The biphasic behavior is characteristic of such polyvalent interactions and in this case was due to the saturation of all available binding sites on the beads and the built up of bipartite populations of beads saturated exclusively by substrate molecules at the expense of tripartite donor substrate acceptor assemblies. The maximum signal concentration of 15 nM falls below the previously reported Km value of Tdp1 of 80 20 nM thus ensuring good assay sensitivity with respect to potential inhibitors.

When the same sequence construct devoid of FITC was tested a weak and considerably right shifted signal evolution was noted. While this result points to some non specific binding the contribution of the latter to the total signal at the 15 nM point appears to be minimal. Moreover the Tdp1 induced cleavage of the FITC DNA substrate when driven to completion yielded background signal thus indicating that the small signal increase observed here was likely due to the interaction between the acceptor bead and the tyrosine moiety. In the presence of increasing concentrations of Tdp1 the FITC coupled tyrosine group was released preventing anti FITC acceptor bead positioning close to the donor bead and subsequently leading to an enzyme dependent loss of signal. DMSO had no effect on the enzymatic reaction data not shown . Neomycin and vanadate two previously described weak Tdp1 inhibitors both inhibited Tdp1 in this assay. The test method and reaction conditions of the original studies of neomycin and vanadate differ from those used in the present assay nevertheless the potencies of the two compounds as determined here were in agreement with these prior publications with neomycin being a weak low millimolar inhibitor and vanadate exhibiting its inhibition in the sub millimolar range.

The assay was further miniaturized to a final volume of 5 l in 1 536 well format by direct volume reduction. The inclusion of Tween 20 in the assay buffer helped prevent enzyme absorption to the polystyrene wells and minimized the interfering effect of promiscuous inhibitors acting via colloidal aggregate formation. In order to verify assay integrity over the intended timeline for automated robotic screening reagent stability over time was assessed by running the assay at multiple time points while storing the working reagents at 4 C. Reagents remained stable for almost 2 days of storage considerably beyond the overnight period needed for a robotic screen.

To further validate the present assay in a real 1536 well based HTS context the LOPACLibrary of Pharmacologically Active Compounds was screened in qHTS mode as eight point concentration series. The pilot screen performed robustly yielding average Z factor Zhang et al. 4 67 73 1999 of 0.71. After data analysis certain active compounds were selected for further studies.

Activity of certain compounds was also tested in secondary radiolabel gel based assays Inamdar et al. 277 27162 27168 2002 Davies et al. 324 917 932 2002 .

The assays identified several tetracycline and oxytetracycline inhibitors of Tdp1. The structures of certain compounds are shown below
