This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application 60 915 763 filed May 3 2007 the entire file wrapper contents of which are incorporated as if set forth at length herein.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by the United States Government for United States Government purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.

This invention relates generally to the field of solid state lasers and in particular is directed to a ruggedized solid state laser for high shock and high vibration environments such as those found in artillery weapons.

Conventional artillery systems and in particular 155 mm howitzer artillery weapons systems use energetic primers in their ignition train. Recently advanced artillery systems have explored the use of laser ignition systems wherein the propellant charge is lased by an emitter positioned in the breech carrier of the artillery.

As can be appreciated positioning a laser ignition system in the breech of an artillery system presents numerous problems. Among the most difficult of these problems are ones related to making the laser ignition system sufficiently robust to endure the extreme vibrations and shock produced by artillery systems as well as the extreme environmental conditions i.e. heat cold wet dry experienced.

The above problems are solved and an advance is made in the art according to the principles of the present invention directed to a diode pumped solid state laser for high shock high vibration environments such as those found in the breech of an artillery system.

Viewed from a first aspect the present invention is directed to a diode pumped solid state laser employing a unique gain medium mounting which permits its use in high shock high vibration environments. Contributing further to its robustness are diode arrays arranged in donut configurations along with an advanced polycrystalline gain medium laser rod .

Viewed from another aspect the present invention is directed to a diode pumped solid state laser as part of a laser ignition system internally integrated into the breech of an artillery system such as a 155 mm howitzer. Advantageously and in sharp contrast to prototype prior art laser ignition systems incorporating flash lamps the diode pumped solid state laser of the present invention permits a seamless integration into a howitzer artillery weapons system without complex mounting provisions or shock isolation system s . Of further advantage the diode pumped solid state laser of the present invention facilitates integration into existing breech hardware with only minor modification to existing breech hardware thereby simplifying the breech and laser assemblies and integration requirements while reducing total system weight.

The following merely illustrates the principles of the invention. It will thus be appreciated that those skilled in the art will be able to devise various arrangements which although not explicitly described or shown herein embody the principles of the invention and are included within its spirit and scope.

Furthermore all examples and conditional language recited herein are principally intended expressly to be only for pedagogical purposes to aid the reader in understanding the principles of the invention and the concepts contributed by the inventor s to furthering the art and are to be construed as being without limitation to such specifically recited examples and conditions.

Moreover all statements herein reciting principles aspects and embodiments of the invention as well as specific examples thereof are intended to encompass both structural and functional equivalents thereof. Additionally it is intended that such equivalents include both currently known equivalents as well as equivalents developed in the future i.e. any elements developed that perform the same function regardless of structure.

In accordance with one preferred embodiment of this invention reference is made to which shows an external view of a diode pumped solid state laser according to the present invention. More particularly one may observe laser body generally a hollow tube structure connecting two end caps and that are positioned at opposite ends of the body tube . Shown further in are electrical leads or wires and output aperture which are part of input end cap and output end cap respectively.

By way of additional background those skilled in the laser arts will quickly recall that lasers generally comprise three essential components an active gain medium a pumping mechanism and a cavity.

Turning now to there is shown a sectional view of the diode pumped solid state laser of with the body tube removed. In this sectional view of it may be seen that the laser assembly comprises a number of segments interposed between the input and output end caps and respectively.

In particular a number of diode donuts . . . . . . and comprise a number of the segments. Further interposed between particular sets of donut segments and in particular donut segments and as well as and are intermediate support segments and .

The stacked diode donuts form a pumping mechanism for the diode pumped solid state laser of the instant application. While not specifically shown in this each of the diode donut segments . . . have disposed along an inner surface a number of light emitting laser diodes positioned around an inner perimeter of each of the diode donuts. In a preferred embodiment we have found that 10 laser diodes have proven sufficient for each of the diode donuts.

The diode donuts . . . are stacked along a gain medium rod which in a preferred embodiment is Yitrium Aluminum Garnet YAG or another suitable material. When configured in this manner the gain medium rod is positioned within the hole of each of the diode donut segments.

Such a pumping scheme wherein an array of diode donuts each comprising a number of laser diodes has been shown and described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 400 740 the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

As disclosed in that patent however the donut diode array configurations comprise arrays of laser diodes that utilize flying leads to connect one array to another. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention a pin and socket configuration is employed instead of the flying leads.

When configured in this manner the pin and socket configuration allows each of the diode array donuts to snap together into stacks. Advantageously such reconfiguration permits the diode array pumping mechanism to decrease in overall size simplifies the assembly of the diode array reduces part count and increases the survivability for high shock and high vibration environments. This reconfiguration of the pumping mechanism enables the integration of the diode array into a smaller more durable and more manufacturable laser package suitable for our extreme environments

Turning now to there is shown a cross sectional view of the diode pumped solid state laser according to the present invention. Of particular interest in this are the mounting segments and intermediate mounting segments and in which may be observed the mounted gain medium rod .

In particular intermediate mounting segments are generally disposed at the central portion of the overall stack and include a mid rod support which are constructed from a compliant material such as Teflon and used to support the central portions of the laser rod . In this manner the rod is supported and stress is minimized. As shown the supports are incorporated in the overall stack between the diode array donut segments thereby mitigating thermal damage which may occur if they were directly illuminated by the diode pumps.

The mounting segments may generally include a compliant compression mechanism or ferrule at one or both ends of the rod . In this inventive manner the rod is supported at both ends and near its middle with diode pumping donuts disposed therebetween the supports.

Shown further in are electrical contacts which in this exemplary embodiment are pin socket mechanisms. In this manner when the individual segments are stacked around the laser rod the electrical contact engage the two adjacent segments. Accordingly electrical power which is applied to electrical contacts will energize each of the diode segments comprising the stack. As a result when power is applied to the electrical contacts the diode segments are energized and thereby pump the active gain medium rod sufficiently to produce a laser action and laser output at output aperture .

Due to the extreme shock and vibration experienced by the laser system an advanced medium may be used for the active gain medium rod. In particular and as can be appreciated by those skilled in the art most conventional laser systems employ a single crystalline laser rod. For this high stress high vibration system however it is preferred that a polycrystalline ceramic laser rod be employed to thereby provide additional strength. Of further advantage such materials generally offer higher laser efficiencies by increasing the ND doping concentration.

Those skilled in the art will recognize that conventional laser pumping applications of laser diode emitters which comprise the diode array donut segments have their output energy limited to maintain acceptable output. Thermal effects may cause changes to the output wavelength of diode emitters to a point that a diode driven device is not operational. In such circumstances the diode temperature increases as the device is switched on.

A further aspect of the present invention is that the diode array is balanced along the length of the rod to sufficiently manage the output wavelength of the diodes within the required input wavelength of the active medium over an extended electrical pulse and temperature range i.e. 50 C to 50 C without the need for ancillary for temperature control.

Finally with shows a cut away view of a large caliber artillery gun breach with a laser igniter disposed therein. Operationally the laser igniter is activated such that it produces laser light which in turn initiates an ignition train of an artillery propellant within the gun.

At this point while we have discussed and described the invention using some specific examples those skilled in the art will recognize that our teachings are not so limited. For example the preferred embodiments of the invention have been provided for the purpose of explaining the principles of the invention and its practical application thereby enabling others skilled in the art to understand the invention. Various embodiments and various modifications are contemplated. Accordingly the invention should be only limited by the scope of the claims attached hereto.
