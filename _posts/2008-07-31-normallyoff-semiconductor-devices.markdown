title: Normally-off semiconductor devices
abstract: Normally-off semiconductor devices are provided. A Group III-nitride buffer layer is provided. A Group III-nitride barrier layer is provided on the Group III-nitride buffer layer. A non-conducting spacer layer is provided on the Group III-nitride barrier layer. The Group III-nitride barrier layer and the spacer layer are etched to form a trench. The trench extends through the barrier layer and exposes a portion of the buffer layer. A dielectric layer is formed on the spacer layer and in the trench and a gate electrode is formed on the dielectric layer. Related methods of forming semiconductor devices are also provided herein.
