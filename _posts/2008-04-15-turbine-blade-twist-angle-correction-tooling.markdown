This Government may have certain rights in this invention pursuant to Contract No. F33657 99 D 2051 awarded by the United States Air Force.

The present application is related to the following copending applications filed on the same day as this application METHODS FOR CORRECTING TWIST ANGLE IN A GAS TURBINE ENGINE BLADE by inventors Garrett Kernozicky Ephraim C. Davis Thomas P. Cap and Paul Balko U.S. application Ser. No. 12 082 864 and METHOD FOR DEVELOPING A REPAIR PROCESS TO CORRECT A DEFORMED GAS TURBINE ENGINE COMPONENT by inventors Garrett Kernozicky Ephraim C. Davis and Thomas P. Cap U.S. application Ser. No. 12 082 865 . All of these applications are incorporated herein by this reference.

The present invention relates to turbine blade repair procedures and tooling. In particular the present invention relates to turbine blade twist angle correction tooling.

A gas turbine engine commonly includes a fan a compressor a combustor a turbine and an exhaust nozzle. During engine operation working medium gases for example air are drawn into and compressed in the compressor. The compressed air is channeled to the combustor where fuel is added to the air and the air fuel mixture is ignited. The products of combustion are discharged to the turbine section which extracts work from these products to produce useful thrust to power for example an aircraft in flight.

The compressor and turbine commonly include alternating stages of rotor blades and stator vanes. Compressor and turbine blades and vanes often include complex contoured airfoil geometries designed to optimally interact with the working medium gas passing through the engine. One common feature of airfoil geometries is the blade twist angle. The twist angle is the angular displacement of the airfoil about a spanwise axis such as the stacking axis from the root to the tip of the airfoil. During normal engine operation the blade twist angle feature which is a critical characteristic of gas turbine engine blades decreases due to thermo mechanical cycling and aerodynamic loading of the blades. The twist angle must be restored to the original manufactured condition during engine overhaul prior to returning the blade to service.

Turbine blade twist correction is commonly accomplished by clamping the blade root in a fixture and manually applying a load to the tip of the blade using for example a wrench configured to clamp the blade tip. An operator twists the blade using the wrench measures the blade twist angle and repeats the twisting procedure until the correct twist angle is reached. Because the operator can only estimate how much force to apply each time this approach often requires many iterations to achieve the desired twist angle. This results in a time consuming labor intensive and costly process. This approach can also result in over twist due to applying excessive force.

The present invention includes a wrench for correcting the twist angle of a turbine blade which wrench includes an adaptor configured to engage a tip of the blade a socket drive configured to engage the adaptor a first handle connected to a first side of the socket drive a second handle connected to a second side of the socket drive and a torque gauge configured to measure a load applied to the blade.

Embodiments of the present invention also include a repair apparatus for correcting the twist angle of a turbine blade which apparatus includes a base plate a fixture connected to the base plate and configured to engage the root of the blade a twist angle gauge connected to the base plate and configured to measure the twist angle of the blade and a wrench configured to apply a measured load to a tip of the blade.

The repair apparatus shown in may be used to correct twist angle of blade . For example root of blade may be clamped in fixture connected to base plate . Twist angle gauge may be moved into position to measure an initial twist angle of blade by contacting shroud . Twist angle gauge may then be disengaged from blade and wrench may be clamped to shroud of blade . A measured load may be applied to wrench to re twist blade to a corrected twist angle.

Devices and methods employing devices according to the present invention have several advantages over prior turbine blade twist correction tooling. Embodiments of the present invention provide an apparatus including a twist angle correction wrench configured to apply a measured load to correct the twist angle of turbine blades. Providing operators a device that indicates the load delivered to the blade under repair reduces the number of iterations if any necessary to repair the blade twist angle and substantially reduces the risk of blade over twisting due to applying excessive force. Turbine blade repairs employing embodiments of the present invention therefore reduce repair time and cost and simultaneously improve repair quality.

Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
