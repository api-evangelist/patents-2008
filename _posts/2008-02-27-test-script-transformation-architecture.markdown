title: Test script transformation architecture
abstract: A test script transformation architecture helps generate accurate test scripts for evolving applications. Applications often have complex graphical user interfaces for which the permutations and combinations of GUI elements give rise to an enormous field of potential commands and command sequences to be tested. Furthermore, these applications change over time, rendering prior test scripts unworkable. The architecture facilitates the automatic generation of new test scripts to reliably test subsequent application versions, while greatly reducing the time, cost, and resource expenditures needed to arrive at new test scripts.
