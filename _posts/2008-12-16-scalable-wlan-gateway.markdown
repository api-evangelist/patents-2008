title: Scalable WLAN gateway
abstract: A technique for combining transmission bandwidths of several mobile stations (MS, MS) is disclosed. A master mobile station (MS) establishes (-) a WLAN base station communicating with WLAN client terminals (CT). One or more slave mobile stations (MS) may detect a predefined network identifier and join the WLAN network. The master (MS) assigns IP addresses for the client terminals (CT) and slave mobile stations (MS). The master also resolves DNS queries in cooperation with external DNS servers. Traffic, including internet packets (IP-IP), between the client terminals and various internet hosts (HO) is tunneled over multiple simultaneous transmission paths (---
