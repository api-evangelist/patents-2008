This application is the US counterpart of WO 2009 0044042 the text of which is incorporated by reference and claims the benefit of priority from the French application No. 0757377 filed on Sep. 6 2007 the text of which is also incorporated by reference.

The present invention relates to a sizing composition for glass strands intended in particular to reinforce organic and or inorganic matrices to the glass strands obtained and to the composites incorporating the said glass strands. More specifically it relates to an aqueous sizing composition which is provided in the form of a physical gel having a rheological behaviour of the thixotropic type.

Reinforcing glass strands are conventionally prepared by mechanically drawing molten glass streams flowing by gravity from the multiple orifices of bushings filled with molten glass to form filaments which are gathered together into base strands which strands are then collected.

During the drawing and before they are gathered together into strands the glass filaments are coated with a sizing composition generally an aqueous sizing composition by passing over a sizing member.

During the manufacture of the strands the size protects the filaments from the abrasion resulting from the rubbing of the latter at high speed over the members of the process acting as lubricant. It also makes it possible to remove the electrostatic charges generated during this rubbing. Finally it gives cohesion to the strand by providing bonding of the filaments to one another.

During the use for the purpose of producing composite materials the size improves the wetting of the glass and the impregnation of the strand by the material to be reinforced and it promotes the adhesion between the glass and the said material thus resulting in composite materials having improved mechanical properties.

The glass strands in their various forms continuous chopped or milled strands mats of continuous or chopped strands meshes wovens knits and the like are commonly used to effectively reinforce matrices of varied natures for example thermoplastic or thermosetting materials and cement.

The most commonly employed sizing compositions are aqueous compositions in particular plastic sizing compositions including a film forming agent of the polymer type which exhibits in particular the advantage of giving mechanical cohesion to the final size and of protecting the strands against mechanical damage and attacks from chemicals and the environment.

These sizing compositions are composed to more than 80 by weight of water and consequently have a low viscosity generally at most equal to 5 mPa s which makes it possible to be able to easily deposit them with relatively simple sizing devices for example using a sizing roll over which the glass filaments pass at high speed. The conditions of the process are adjusted so that the desired amount of size is deposited during the passage of the strand over the sizing device.

However the presence of water in such a high amount in the sizing composition exhibits disadvantages.

Owing to the fact that it is not very viscous the sizing composition does not hold well to the glass when the strand comes into contact with the various elements which act to guide it up to the winder. A draining phenomenon occurs followed by centrifugal projection of the size under the effect of the drawing speed. A portion of the sizing composition is also lost under the effect of the centrifugal force during the winding of the strand. The loss can range up to 50 depending on the sizing compositions.

Furthermore water is harmful to the mechanical properties of the final composite as it reduces adhesion between the glass strands and the material to be reinforced. The water consequently has to be removed which conventionally takes place by drying the packages of strands in a large chamber heated to a temperature of the order of 100 to 150 C. for 10 to 20 hours depending on the weight of the package and its initial water content. Apart from the fact that it is expensive and lengthy the drying operation brings about selective migration of the constituents of the size as a function of their affinity for water and their molecular weight essentially from the inside to the outside of the package and a significant increase in the amount of size up to 800 on the strand situated at the periphery with respect to the centre of the package. As a result of this variation the properties of the strand are not constant over the entire length of the package which is reflected in particular by processing problems in weaving operations and the appearance of impregnation defects spots in composites having an organic matrix.

One means of overcoming this disadvantage consists in peeling the package by removing a certain length of strand situated at the periphery in order to retain only the portion of strand comprising the required amount of size. As a general rule the properties of the strand are regarded as acceptable if the ratio of the maximum content of size on the strand in the package to the nominal content of the size is at most equal to 2 Above this value the quality of the strand is not satisfactory for the targeted applications appearance of the defects mentioned in the preceding paragraph . The amount of strand to be removed in order for this ratio to be satisfactory generally represents 2 to 5 of the weight of the package. This operation is expensive as it requires specific installations and additional operators.

The same phenomenon of migration of the size is observed on straight sided packages such as rovings for example obtained by winding the strand directly under the bushing. However in this case the size migrates both towards the periphery and the sides of the package. For this reason the above mentioned peeling solution cannot be applied.

The aim of the present invention is to limit the migration of the size during the drying of the packages.

This aim is achieved according to the invention by a sizing composition for glass strands which comprises a texturing agent capable of conferring on the said composition the appearance of a physical gel.

Another subject matter of the invention is the abovementioned glass strands coated with the sizing composition.

A further subject matter of the invention is the composite materials comprising an organic and or inorganic matrix reinforced by the glass strands in accordance with the invention.

More specifically a subject matter of the invention is a sizing composition in the form of a physical gel comprising as by weight 

The sizing composition according to the invention is provided in the form of a physical gel having a rheological behaviour of the thixotropic type.

The term physical gel is understood to mean a system comprising a compound capable of being arranged in the form of a finely dispersed solid phase in a predominant liquid phase and of forming a network of low density which is easy to destructure by virtue of the presence of weak bonds this network being reversible.

The term thixotropic behaviour is understood to mean the combination of mechanisms which mean that a fluid experiences a decrease in its viscosity when it is subjected to an increase in the shear stress and regains the initial level of viscosity when said stress ceases.

The physical gel in accordance with the invention has the ability to be converted to a liquid of low viscosity generally of less than 100 mPa s when it is subjected to shearing of the order of 1 10s corresponding to the passage of the glass filaments over the sizing device.

The physical gel state of the sizing composition according to the invention is obtained by adding at least one texturing agent to the sizing composition this texturing agent being chosen from specific polymers which are characterized in that they comprise a high proportion of hydroxyl functional groups.

The texturing agent in accordance with the invention is chosen from polysaccharides such as xanthans guars and succinoglycans in particular exhibiting an average molecular weight of greater than 100 000 preferably of less than 10 10and advantageously of less than 5 10. Xanthans and succinoglycans are preferred.

Preferably the content of texturing agent varies from 0.15 to 2 by weight of the sizing composition and it is advantageously less than 0.6 .

The polymeric film forming agent plays several roles it makes it possible to protect the glass filaments from abrasion during drawing on the one hand and the strand from attacks from chemicals and the environment on the other hand it confers integrity on the strand finally it improves the compatibility of the sizing composition with the matrix to be reinforced.

The choice of the film forming agent depends largely on the chemical nature of the material to be reinforced.

The film forming agent can be chosen from polyvinyl acetates homopolymers or copolymers for example copolymers of vinyl acetate and of ethylene polyesters polyethers epoxy compounds polyacrylics homo or copolymers and polyurethanes. Polyvinyl acetates epoxy compounds and polyethylene glycols with a weight of greater than or equal to 20 000 are preferred.

The film forming agent is generally introduced into the sizing composition in the form of an emulsion.

Preferably the content of film forming agent varies from 2.5 to 7 by weight of the sizing composition.

The sizing composition comprises at least one compound chosen from the group consisting of plasticizing agents surface active agents and dispersing agents the role of which is to promote the suspending and to make possible homogeneous dispersion of the various constituents of the composition while preventing problems of separation of the liquid phases and to provide efficient and rapid wetting of the strands by the material to be reinforced during the manufacture of the composites. The plasticizing surface active and dispersing agents often have several functions and for this reason it is difficult to classify them in one or other of the abovementioned categories.

The amount of compound chosen from the above mentioned group preferably varies from 0.15 to 4 by weight of the sizing composition.

The coupling agent makes it possible to provide the attaching of the size to the surface of the glass.

The coupling agent is chosen from hydrolysable compounds in particular which can be hydrolysed in the presence of an acid such as acetic lactic or citric acid which belong to the group consisting of silanes such as glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane acryloyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane methacryloyloxy propyltrimethoxysilane poly oxyethylene oxypropylene trimethoxysilane aminopropyltriethoxysilane vinyltrimethoxysilane phenylaminopropyltrimethoxy silane styrylaminoethylaminopropyltrimethoxysilane and tert butylcarbamoylpropyltrimethoxysilane siloxanes such as 1 3 divinyltetraethoxydisiloxane titanates zirconates in particular of aluminium and the mixtures of these compounds. Preferably silanes are chosen.

In addition to the abovementioned constituents which participate essentially in the structure of the size one or more other constituents may be added as additives.

It is thus possible to introduce at least one lubricating agent such as a fatty acid ester which is optionally alkoxylated for example decyl laurate isopropyl palmitate cetyl palmitate isopropyl stearate butyl stearate isobutyl stearate trimethylolpropane trioctanoate and trimethylolpropane tridecanoate an alkylphenol derivative for example ethoxylated octylphenol a fatty alcohol which is optionally alkoxylated for example polyethylene glycol laurate or stearate comprising methyl endings advantageously comprising less than 10 oxyethylene units a mixture based on mineral oil an alkylamine a polyethylene wax and a mixture of these compounds.

It is also possible to add at least one of the following additives complexing agent such as an EDTA derivative gallic acid or phosphonic acid derivative antifoaming agent such as a silicone a polyol and a vegetable oil and an acid used to control the pH during the hydrolysis of the coupling agent for example acetic lactic or citric acid.

The sizing composition can also comprise at least one compound which makes it possible to control the amount of free hydroxyl groups present in the size after the stage of drying the strand in order to have a weak hydrophilic nature which makes it possible to retain good resistance to ageing in a humid environment.

This compound is chosen from epoxy compounds and masked isocyanates which can be thermally activated which are preferably mono or difunctional and which have a molecular weight of less than 1000 preferably of less than 700.

The epoxy compounds are chosen from aliphatic epoxy compounds such as butyl glycidyl ether 1 4 butanediol diglycidyl ether and polyoxyethylene diglycidyl ethers comprising at most 4 ethylene oxide units cycloaliphatic epoxy compounds such as cyclohexane dimethanol diglycidyl ether or aromatic epoxy compounds such as phenyl diglycidyl ether.

The masked isocyanates which can be activated by the thermal route are chosen from isocyanates including one or more N oxime N caprolactam and furfural groups. The unmasking temperature must correspond to the temperature for drying the strand generally between 105 and 140 C.

The compound which makes it possible to control the amount of free hydroxyl groups can also be chosen from organic acids exhibiting at least two carboxyl functional groups for example adipic acid citric acid poly acrylic acid s and poly methacrylic acid s. Generally these acids exhibit a molecular weight of less than 1000 preferably of less than 500.

Advantageously a catalyst of the tertiary amine type is used in combination with the epoxy compound or with the isocyanate. The catalyst can be chosen from known compounds for example substituted phenols such as tris dimethylaminomethyl phenol and imidazolines such as N stearylimidazoline or their derivatives.

The amount of water to be used to form the sizing composition is determined so as to obtain a solids content dry extract which varies from 3 to 15 preferably from 5 to 10 .

b mixing the coupling agent s the film forming agent the compound chosen from the group consisting of plasticizing agents surface active agents and dispersing agents optionally additives and water 

Another subject matter of the invention is the glass strands coated with the abovementioned sizing composition.

In the present invention the term strands is understood to mean the base strands resulting from the gathering together under the bushing of a multitude of filaments and the products derived from these strands in particular the assemblies of these strands in the form of rovings. Such assemblies can be obtained by simultaneously paying out several packages of base strands and by then gathering them together in tows which are wound onto a rotating support. They may also be direct rovings with a count or linear density equivalent to that of assembled rovings obtained by gathering together filaments directly under the bushing and winding onto a rotating support.

As mentioned above the aqueous sizing composition is deposited on the filaments before they are gathered together into base strand s . The water is usually removed by drying the strands after collection under temperature and duration conditions which make it possible to achieve a water content of less than 0.25 preferably of less than 0.1 . Generally drying is carried out at a temperature which varies from 100 to 150 C. for 10 to 20 hours depending on the type of package and the initial water content.

The sized strand in accordance with the invention can be made of glass of any type for example E C R AR and glass with a reduced level of boron less than 6 . E and AR glasses are preferred.

The diameter of the glass filaments constituting the strands can vary to a great extent for example from 5 to 30 m. In the same way the linear density of the strand can vary widely from 11 to 4800 tex according to the applications targeted.

As a general rule the amount of size represents 0.2 to 5 by weight of the final strand preferably 0.35 to 3 .

A further subject matter of the invention is a composite material combining at least one organic and or inorganic material and glass strands coated with the sizing composition described above. The organic material can be composed of one or more thermoplastic or thermosetting polymers and the inorganic material can for example be a cement material.

a The coupling agent is hydrolysed by introducing it into a large volume of water pH approximately 10 12 SILQUEST A1100 and A1120 if appropriate acidified with an acid for example acetic acid citric acid or lactic acid pH 3.5 5 SILQUEST A174 A1128 A1387 and A187 . The mixture is kept stirred at ambient temperature for approximately 20 minutes.

b The silanes are mixed if appropriate and with modest stirring the film forming agent the additives lubricating surface active plasticizing agents catalyst and water are successively added to the solution of coupling agent s the water being in the amount desired in order to obtain the desired solids content taking into account the amount of texturing agent to be introduced.

c The texturing agent is slowly added with vigorous stirring to the mixture from stage b . When a gel appears a shearing treatment is applied for example using an ULTRATURRAX 5000 9000 rpm for 3 to 5 minutes. The gel is destructured to give a liquid of low viscosity under the effect of mechanical shearing which makes it possible to homogenize the mixture and then it is rapidly reformed after stirring is halted.

It is measured using a Brookfield LVF viscometer equipped with a spindle of LV type under the following conditions the spindle is immersed in 500 g of a sizing composition present in a cylindrical container with a diameter of 9 cm the spindle is rotated at the appropriate speed for example a No. 2 spindle rotating at 60 rpm makes it possible to measure viscosity of up to 500 mPa s for 1 minute and the viscosity is measured. The viscosity is measured at 25 C. and is expressed in mPa s.

The measured value does not correspond to the absolute value of the viscosity the measured values can be compared with one another.

The amount of fuzz makes it possible to assess the resistance to abrasion of a strand. It is measured by weighing the amount of material which separates from the strand after the latter has passed over a series of 4 or 6 cylindrical ceramic bars positioned so that the deflection angle of the strand at each bar is equal to 90 . The amount of fuzz is given in mg per 1 kg of strand tested.

It is evaluated by measuring the tensile breaking force under the conditions defined by Standard ISO 3341. It is expressed in N tex.

It is evaluated by the ratio R of the maximum content of the size measured on the strand in the roving to a nominal level of the size. A ratio R is acceptable if it is at most equal to 2.

The length of strand L unwound from the roving necessary in order to achieve a ratio R equal to 2 is also indicated this length corresponding to the peeling of the roving. It is expressed in meters.

The sizing compositions are applied using a full bath sizing roll to glass filaments having a diameter equal to 19 m Examples 1 to 12 or 13.6 m Examples 13 to 16 which are gathered together into a wound strand in the form of a roving with a weight equal to 7 kg. The roving is dried at 130 C. for 15 hours Examples 1 to 13 and at 115 C. for 15 hours and then 150 C. for 5 hours Example 14 .

The glass strands according to Examples 5 7 and 9 are used to form composite plaques comprising parallel strands under the conditions according to Standard ISO 9291 by using the following resins 

Test specimens are cut out from the plaques and are treated for 72 hours epoxy resin or 24 hours polyester resins 1 and 2 in boiling water. The three point bending strength is measured on the test specimens in the transverse direction and the strength for a content of glass equal to 100 is calculated. The result of the measurements is given in Table 2.
