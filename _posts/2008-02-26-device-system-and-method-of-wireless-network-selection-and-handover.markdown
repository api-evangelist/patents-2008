Multi radio NIC includes a multi radio hardware module associated with a multi radio firmware for example a unified or joint firmware module or multiple firmware modules. The multi radio hardware module includes a combination of multiple co located wireless transceivers or radios wireless transmitters and or wireless receivers e.g. co located on a single card or board sharing a common Integrated Circuit IC sharing a common circuit board sharing a common card or board sharing a common housing being in close proximity to each other e.g. less than ten or fifteen centimeters and or optionally sharing one or more of the antennas . For example the multi radio hardware module includes a GPS transceiver an IEEE 802.11 transceiver an IEEE 802.16 transceiver and a WWAN transceiver .

The ME may further take into account the user profile and application requirements as indicated by arrow for example the network selection module or other suitable component of ME may utilize the application requirement as indicated by arrow . Based on the wireless network selected by the network selection module a network switching module manages or performs the network switching vis vis the multi radio hardware module utilizing a link .

Driver further includes user profile and application requirements . Driver additionally includes driver APIs for example multi radio NIC APIs as well as user profile and application requirements APIs .

Device or one or more components thereof are able to go into or out of a power save mode or other reduced power mode. The power mode e.g. power save mode may be communicated by the driver to the ME link or by the ME to the multi radio firmware link . The power save mode may be implemented for example using a power manager able to control increase and or decrease the power provided by a power source e.g. an internal or external battery to one or more components of device or able to selectively activate or deactivate one or more components of device .

In some embodiments links may include for example one or more communication links one or more multimedia links or other type of links or interface.

One or more applications running on device may initiate or request wireless network switching or wireless network handover. The applications may include for example a connection manager User Interface UI or Graphic UI GUI a Voice over IP VoIP application a Virtual Private Network VPN application or the like. The applications may communicate with the driver APIs of driver which in turn may operate the multi radio driver functionality of driver in order to control one or more of wireless transceivers of the multi radio NIC . Additionally or alternatively an operator of a wireless network may request wireless network switching or wireless network handover.

In some embodiments the architecture of device may be utilized for network selection seamless network switching network handover and or Media Independent Handover MIH for example in accordance with IEEE 802.21 standard. Furthermore device may utilize the ME in order to reduce or minimize power consumption e.g. by eliminating the need to wale up a host from a power save mode to perform inter network transitions. A single platform thus allows integration of multiple radios on a single chipset accordingly network selection network switching IEEE 802.21 based MIH or other operations or services that involve multiple co located wireless transceivers may be performed efficiently and or at a reduced power consumption.

In some embodiments the ME may operate as a wireless connection manager optionally implementing IEEE 802.21 capabilities. The ME utilizes smart triggers handover commands and information services to perform MIH e.g. in accordance with IEEE 802.21. The smart triggers indicate changes in state and transmission behavior of the physical and data link layers or predict the state changes of these layers. The handover commands define a set of primitives or commands which allow clients and network s to initiate and coordinate the switching over process from a first network to a second network. The information services provides a data store of available networks and network parameters and defines query response messages e.g. optionally using standardized messages to access and retrieve such information which is utilized in handovers for each available or accessible network. For example an information server may reside in an operator network and includes a repository of networks and their static characteristics.

The architecture of device may eliminate one or more drawbacks of conventional platforms which require multiple separate NICs to individually and separately access each wireless network. For example in some conventional platforms multiple NIC drivers reside on a main host and it may not be possible to perform IEEE 802.21 inter network handovers when the host is in power save mode for example it may be required to power on an entire communication sub system and host before a handover between networks may be affected.

Some embodiments may not require complex interaction among multiple NIC drivers and multiple connection managers in order to reach a common decision on network selection or on the best network selection. This is in contrast with some conventional systems in which each wireless NIC is associated with a separate driver and or connection manager application and management of adapters and network selection or switching requires multiple levels of APIs and further increases the cost or the complexity of platform.

Some embodiments may not require to implement MIH logic beyond the driver level or the ME level for example some embodiments may not require to utilize the upper software stack and or the OS to implement MIH logic. Some embodiments may eliminate the dependency of a platform on connection managers provided by an Independent Software Vendor ISV to which all the Voice over IP VoIP applications and audio video applications may need to develop multiple hooks e.g. into each ISV component or module .

Some embodiments may eliminate drawbacks or problems which may arise in some conventional platforms having multiple MIH related components provided by different manufacturers and associated with multiple specific APIs. Some embodiments may thus eliminate duplication of complexity computing resources or overhead as well as cost of development to implement MIH logic.

In some embodiments the client device e.g. device or other unified communication device or appliance may not be required to query a server by providing their location e.g. obtained using GPS and build a network map of their wireless neighborhood. In some embodiments smart triggers may be local to system or to a particular wireless network thereof whereas the handover commands and or the information service s may include interaction with the operator network.

Some embodiments may not require a complex and costly architecture in which each wireless NIC is implemented separately using a separate wireless transceiver having separate firmware which in turn individually communicates with a separate driver which in turn is individually associated with a separate vendor API such that the multiple vendor APIs interact through an adapter control layer with an application layer logic that includes smart triggers handover commands information services network selection module and network switching module which in turn utilizes connection manager APIs to interact with multiple applications and or connection and policy manager s e.g. associated with user policies and operator policies .

Some embodiments utilize a multi radio platform and connection manager architecture having multiple radios or wireless transceivers integrated on a single NIC. Some embodiments may preserve substantially all network flows for example as specified by the IEEE 802.21 protocol. A single or unified point of interaction is provided by the multi radio NIC for substantially all the upper layer software applications and components. This architecture embeds all MIH components within the ME and a common driver for all network radios. The MIH components within the unified driver and ME e.g. optionally implemented as a virtual partition or core may initiate the network selection process and or network switching.

In some embodiments impending disconnection of device from an existing wireless network e.g. IEEE 802.11 network may be compensated by activating an alternate wireless network e.g. IEEE 802.16 using the driver and ME . For example loss of the IEEE 802.11 network may be detected by falling signal strength and may result in a predictive trigger e.g. indicating link going down . Additionally or alternatively the network operator may issue a handover command or handover request to device commanding or requesting the device to switch to another wireless network e.g. on the same or on a different physical link for example for load balancing considerations or due to a change in GPS coordinates which may allow new network availability. The network selection module of the ME tales into account the operator policy and optionally other policies e.g. user policy Information Technology IT policy user preferences and application requirements and may select a new network and initiate a switch to the newly selected network. Accordingly the ME may implement suitable logic for network connectivity.

Some embodiments allow IEEE 802.21 based network selection and handovers using manageability and virtualized platforms utilizing integrated multi radios thereby achieving host power optimization. For example the integration of multiple wireless radios on a single multi radio NIC may allow to integrate all of most of the connection manager functionality in the NIC driver and or the ME thereby allowing to implement driver as intelligent driver capable of network selection network switching and MIH. The multi radio driver is thus able to control the various wireless radios and may include connection management functionality. Furthermore the ME architecture may allow secure connection to the operator network to retrieve operator policy for interaction using handover commands and or for obtaining network map s from information server s . The architecture further allows the device to stay connected to a wireless network by implementing network switching through the ME or through a virtual partition while other components of device are stand by mode or power save mode or reduced power mode thereby reducing the power consumption of device . In some embodiments device may not include ME implemented as a separate component for example network selection network switching and other logic or functionalities described herein with reference to the ME may be implemented as part of the multi radio NIC .

Some embodiments may support an always on always connected usage model which requires network selection and or network connectivity even when the host device e.g. device is in low power or stand by state. The network selection and network switching is offloaded from the host device to the ME whereas the multi radio NIC provides the necessary connectivity information to the network selection components thereby allowing low power standby operation.

Additionally the offloading of the handover commands and the information service components of the MIH to the ME allows the interaction with the network operator e.g. for operator policy download information service and handover commands to be performed securely and in a manageable way thereby allowing secure and trusted operator access to network related policies on the client device . For example since the operator policy network map and user policy are in the secure ME unauthorized deletion or modifications of these network parameters is eliminated furthermore this reduces operator costs in managing profiles on service provider devices and provides a secure execution environment of operator critical policies and software.

In some embodiments the information service runs on the ME and the rest of the platform may be in standby state or reduced power mode. Accordingly the network map may still be constantly updated such that as soon as the platform comes out of the standby state the network selection module may select a new network for connection.

In some embodiments applications e.g. the VPN application Session Initiation Protocol SIP based applications or the like may need to take into account connectivity changes and may need to interact with the connection manager. In contrast with some conventional platforms in which the connection manager runs as a user level application and in which it may be complex for multiple applications to interface with the connection manager due to proprietary interfaces some embodiments provide the connection manager as part of the multi radio NIC driver thereby allowing substantially all the applications to interface through the driver APIs with the driver .

The network selection module receives as input a local user policy and or a local operator policy arrow . The information service module requests arrow and receives arrow location information from the GPS radio . The client side information service module sends a query arrow to the information server which returns a list of wireless network s arrow . The client side information service module transfers to the network selection module a network s map arrow based on the location of the wireless device . The network selection module commands the multi radio NIC host driver to scan wireless network s using one or more wireless transceivers of the wireless device arrow . The multi radio NIC host driver and the multi radio NIC hardware exchange a request and a response arrow for wireless network scan and the result of the wireless network s scan is returned by the multi radio NIC host driver to the network selection module arrow .

The network selection module selects a new wireless network based on policies including user policy operator policy application requirements and other criteria and the network selection module commands the network switching module to switch to the new wireless network arrow . The network switching module commands the multi radio NIC host driver to disconnect from the current wireless network and to connect to the new wireless network or vice versa namely first connect to new wireless network and then disconnect from the current network arrow . The multi radio NIC host driver and the multi radio NIC hardware exchange a request and a response arrow for wireless network disconnection and connection.

The wireless device may enter steady state operation . Then the smart triggers may command the multi radio NIC host driver to query the Media Access Control MAC Physical PHY link layer properties for one or more wireless transceivers of wireless device arrow . The multi radio NIC host driver and the multi radio NIC hardware exchange a request and a response arrow for wireless MAC PHY properties and the smart triggers determine the quality of wireless connection line . For example the smart triggers may notify the network selection module that the quality of the current wireless communication link is deteriorating arrow or is below or crosses a pre defined link quality threshold. The network selection module selects a new wireless network and commands the network switching module to switch to the new wireless network arrow . The network switching module commands the multi radio NIC host driver to disconnect from the current wireless network and to connect to the new wireless network arrow or vice versa namely first connect to the new wireless network and then disconnect from the current network . The multi radio NIC host driver and the multi radio NIC hardware exchange a request and a response arrow for wireless network disconnection and connection.

The server side handover commands module may send to the client side handover commands module a handover command indicating a network initiated or operator initiated handover command arrow . The client side handover commands module transfers the handover command to the network selection module arrow . Depending on the handover command the network selection module may select a new network and commands the network switching module to switch to the new network arrow . The network switching module commands the multi radio NIC host driver to disconnect from the current wireless network and to connect to the new wireless network arrow . The multi radio NIC host driver and the multi radio NIC hardware exchange a request and a response arrow for wireless network disconnection and connection. The network selection module reports the handover completion status to the server side handover commands module arrow .

The wireless device may be required to enter a reduced power mode a power save mode or a standby mode . Accordingly context is transferred from the multi radio NIC host driver to the ME and the wireless device enters standby mode arrow . The transferred context may include for example connection context application context TCP IP context a combination of multiple context parameters or substantially entire mobility context. Once the wireless device is in standby mode block the ME may interact with the multi radio NIC hardware arrow . Once the wireless device exits the standby mode context e.g. an updated context may be transferred from the ME to the multi radio NIC host driver .

Although shows for demonstrative purposes a sequence of operations or events in accordance with some embodiments other embodiments may utilize other sets of operations and other sequences of events. For example demonstrates an information service module service module requesting for network map and resulting in network switching followed by smart trigger generation resulting in network switching further followed by network handover command resulting in network switching. In other embodiments these events namely querying for network map smart triggers and handover commands may be asynchronous and may occur other sequences. Similarly particular operations shown in may be performed asynchronously or in other sequences for example the operation of arrow need not necessarily be performed after the operation of arrow or the like.

Other operations or sets of operations may be used in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. For example in some embodiments in order to determine whether or not to change a wireless communication link or to switch wireless networks power related properties may be estimated calculated or utilized e.g. instead of or in addition to utilizing link quality properties or other suitable parameters. For example some embodiments may determine to change a wireless communication link or to switch between wireless communication networks if it is determined or estimated that a first wireless communication link may offer lower power consumption relative to a second wireless communication link or if it is determined or estimated that changing the wireless link may result in reduced power consumption.

In some embodiments in order to switch between wireless networks or between wireless links the wireless device disconnects a first wireless link with a first wireless network and then establishes a second wireless link with a second wireless network. In other embodiments in order to switch between wireless networks the wireless device maintains the first wireless link with the first wireless network then establishes the second wireless link with the second wireless network and then disconnects the first wireless link with the first wireless network e.g. make before break . In some embodiments the wireless device maintains both the first and second wireless links active and an application service is switched from the first wireless network to the second wireless network. In some embodiments network switching may utilize two transceivers for example disconnection of a first transceiver from a first network and connection of a second transceiver to a second network in this order or in reverse order . In other embodiments network switching or link switching may utilize a single transceiver for example to disconnect from a first network and to connect to a second network. Other network switching mechanisms may be used.
