This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application 60 926 021 filed on Apr. 23 2007 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention pursuant to Grant No. EEC0310723 awarded by National Science Foundation.

The present disclosure relates to coils. More in particular it relates to a foldable polymer based coil structure and a method for fabricating such coil. The coil structure of the present disclosure is suitable for radiofrequency RF operation.

Inductive coupling between a pair of coils is a very promising technology for wireless power and data transmission to implantation components in many biomedical applications. For a retinal prosthesis specifically a receiving coil with high self inductance and low series resistance i.e. high Q is needed to optimize the efficiency of the system. However thin film coils made by existing conventional planar micromachining technology cannot achieve this requirement due to geometrical restrictions. Some techniques such as electroplating and suspended structures see for example Jae Y. Park and Mark G. Allen IEEE Transactions on Magnetics Vol. 35 NO. 5 1999 3544 3546 have been developed to make high Q coils but the processes are usually expensive complicate and unreliable.

Where Lis the self inductance N is the number of turns d in cm is the mean diameter of the coil t in cm is the coil width Ris the series resistance is the metal resistivity L is the total wire length and Ais the cross section area of the metal wire. See for example Herbert Dwight McGraw Hill Book Company 1945 ch 31 p 267. With these known parameters the intrinsic Q factor which represents the efficiency of an inductor is defined by the following formula where is the angular resonant frequency of the AC signal i.e. 2 1 MHz for the current system 

Theoretically the higher the Q factor the more efficiently the coil performs. That means the power transfer efficiency of the system can be improved significantly by both increasing the self inductance and lowering the series resistance of the receiving coil. Therefore multiple layers of metal and thick metal are more desirable but in reality this is difficult to fabricate using conventional micromachining techniques.

Further embodiments of the present disclosure are provided in the written specification drawings and claims.

A first advantage of the device and method of the present disclosure is that of providing high Q coils with multiple layers of metal that can be fabricated without using electroplating technology.

A second advantage of the present disclosure is that the skins obtained in accordance with the present disclosure can be folded or stacked and bonded together using a post fabrication thermal bonding process.

A third advantage is that the devices fabricated in accordance with the present disclosure are flexible and foldable which can help to prevent any undesired degradation or mechanical damage in the region of implantation.

Additionally according to some of its embodiments the overall device is sealed by parylene which makes it biocompatible. Moreover although the device is specifically designed for intraocular retinal prostheses it can be used in other biomedical applications which use wireless power and data transmission such as micro stimulators for paralyzed muscle stimulation.

The device can be completely made using micromachining steps which has many advantages over traditional fabrication approaches for bioimplantable coils such as smaller size precise dimensional control and feasibility for system integration.

The metal structure shown in is a two layered metal structure where one layer of metal is for building the inductor conductive wires and a second layer of metal is used for making the interconnections between the conductive wires and for forming the return leads or contact interconnection vias to other components by way of the metal contacts .

The structure shown in is symmetrical so that it can be folded to form a two layered structure. shows a perspective view of the structure of when folded. This thin film skin can be easily folded into two layers thanks to the flexibility of parylene C Young s modulus about 4 GPa .

Many different metals and conductive polymers can be used as the electrically conducting material. Other parylenes polymers or plastics can be used as the insulating material instead of parylene C. Moreover the thickness of the insulating layer can be varied for different application environments. The thickness of the metal layers can be any kind of thickness e.g. 20 nm to 4 m. The thickness of each polymer layer can range for example from 2 m to 20 m.

After the parylene based skin is released from the substrate the structure is folded and then a thermal bonding process is performed in a vacuum oven to fuse the separate layers together. The vacuum oven is used to prevent the oxidation of parylene C which could make parylene very fragile. The bonding temperature should be below the melting point of parylene C typically about 290 C. for example 200 C. for 2 days. Other mechanisms can be used to heat up parylene skins instead of the thermal method such as microwave.

According to an embodiment of the disclosure the coil shown so far can be specifically designed for intraocular retinal prostheses. A particular case of such embodiment provides for a coil having 28 turns of metal wires and being 10 mm in outer diameter. The metal can be encapsulated by 9 m of parylene C.

As already mentioned above the person skilled in the art will understand that the techniques shown so far can also be used for coils having a number of layers greater than two. In this case alignment between layers during folding could become an issue if too many layers are made with this technique.

In applications with a large number of such layers a special jig i.e. a guiding and holding device or mold for aligning and holding matching the size of the coil can help to ensure good alignments. Good alignment is desired to achieve the maximum theoretically possible self inductance L . Such self inductance will drop down in presence of misalignment. shows an example of such jig which comprises a top metal piece and a bottom metal piece to allow the parylene skins to be aligned and sandwiched in between during the thermal bonding process. For example the jig can be made of aluminum which does not stick to parylene C at high temperature and allows the device to be easily peeled off after thermal bonding. Alternatively the jig can be made of Teflon . Additionally to improve the thermal bonding process clamping force or pressure can be applied on the jig. Alignment can occur through the presence of alignment holes see adapted to match alignment poles provided in the jig.

Stackable coils can be an alternative approach for making high Q coils with multiple layers of metal. shows a perspective schematical view of a stackable coil in accordance with a further embodiment of the present disclosure. In this embodiment each layer of coil is fabricated individually with vertical interconnection vias precisely positioned and fully opened. Then the parylene metal skins are aligned and stacked together with the assistance of a matching jig . Also in this case small e.g. 500 microns diameter poles see also FIG. can be built on the jig to match the alignment holes on the periphery of the coils . The parylene metal skins can be aligned by feeding the poles through the holes . After that a similar thermal treatment process in vacuum oven is used to bond the layers together. Finally silver paste can be filled into the open vias to build the interconnections between layers while the top opening is sealed with biocompatible epoxy or parylene to render an implantable final device. Instead of silver paste other conductive materials such as conductive epoxy and solder can be used for making the contacts between layers.

In summary according to some of the embodiments of the present disclosure a polymer based foldable coil employing a multilayer polymer metal thin film is shown. According to such embodiments the device is completely made using microfabrication technologies which are compatible with the existing processes developed for other system components such as multi electrode arrays. Microfabrication refers to processes for building miniature structures with sizes in micron scale and smaller such as photolithography chemical vapor deposition CVD E beam evaporation oxygen plasma etching and wet etching process. Because of the flexibility of parylene or some similarly flexible polymer this thin film skin can be folded and bonded together to form a multiple layer structure using a post fabrication heat treatment. The geometry of the coil shown in such embodiments is determined by the dimension of the human eyeball and this can be varied for other applications.

Accordingly what has been shown is a foldable polymer based coil structure and a method for fabricating the same. While the coil and the method have been described by means of specific embodiments and applications thereof it is understood that numerous modifications and variations could be made thereto by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the claims the disclosure may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein.
