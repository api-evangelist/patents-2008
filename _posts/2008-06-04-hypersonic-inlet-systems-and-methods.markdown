This application claims priority benefit from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60 942 186 filed on Jun. 5 2007 entitled HYPERSONIC INLET SYSTEMS AND METHODS .

This invention was made with government support under subcontract number G1103 0002 to U.S. Government Contract NNL04AA01C awarded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.

The present disclosure relates to airbreathing propulsion systems and more specifically to hypersonic inlet systems and methods.

In order to operate efficiently airbreathing hypersonic vehicles generally rely on at least two propulsion system types to complete their missions one to propel the vehicle at relatively low speeds Mach 0 to 3 4 and one to take over at higher speeds Mach 3 4 to Mach 7 9 for hydrocarbon fueled accelerator and cruise vehicles and up to Mach 10 12 for hydrogen fueled cruisers . The low speed propulsion system is typically a turbine engine designed to survive the thermal stresses of high Mach operation and supply adequate thrust over the required speed range. High speed thrust may be provided by a dual mode ram scramjet.

Integration of these propulsion systems on a hypersonic vehicle may be enhanced by a common Multi Role Air Induction System MRAIS to supply the needs of both propulsion system types creating a so called turbine base combined cycle TBCC propulsion system. Requirements for an MRAIS include supplying the required amount of air with adequate pressure recovery and sufficient operability margin for each propulsion system independently and also during propulsion system transition from low speed to high speed operating mode. MRAIS efficient operation and smooth mode transition rely on a well designed highly integrated system of inlet variable geometry and bleed.

Prior art hypersonic inlet systems typically include variable geometry systems that are used to redirect and compress the incoming airflow during various portions of the vehicle s flight regime. Known hypersonic inlet systems include for example those systems disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 054 288 issued to Salemann and U.S. Pat. No. 5 337 975 issued to Peinemann. Typically prior art TBCC inlets have relied upon a variable planar or two dimensional 2D geometry integrated into an over under arrangement with the turbine flowpath being above the ramjet scramjet flowpath and having the turbine inlets external to and forward of the ramjet scramjet inlet while sharing a common external forebody. Typically planar variable geometry features e.g. flat flaps with effective sealing have not been effectively integrated with inlets which are defined by axisymmetric flowfields. Axisymmetric flowfield inlets may offer benefits including more efficient compression in converging i.e. inward turning flows than 2 D flowfields which can have stronger shock waves and greater losses. Thus although such prior art hypersonic inlet systems may provide desirable results there is room for improvement.

The present invention is directed to hypersonic inlet systems and methods. Embodiments of the present invention may advantageously provide desired inlet capabilities including supplying the required amount of air with adequate pressure recovery and sufficient operability margin for each propulsion system independently and also during propulsion system transition from low speed to high speed operating mode without a great deal of mechanical complexity.

In one embodiment a method of designing an inlet for an airbreathing propulsion system includes establishing a design point flowfield defining an aperture shape tracing a plurality of streamlines around a perimeter of the aperture shape on the design flowfield to provide an intermediate shape splitting the intermediate shape along a lateral centerline to provide a left lateral half and a right lateral half and interchanging positions of the left lateral half and the right lateral half to form the inlet. In alternate embodiments the design point flowfield may be an axisymmetric flowfield and the aperture shape may be a two dimensional e.g. rectangular shape.

In another embodiment an inlet for an airbreathing propulsion system includes an inboard surface at least partially shaped to conform to a plurality of streamline traces of a design flowfield approaching an aperture an outboard surface spaced apart from the inboard surface an upper surface extending between the inboard and outboard surfaces and a lower surface extending between the inboard and outboard surfaces wherein leading edges of the inboard outboard upper and lower surfaces cooperatively define the aperture.

In a further embodiment an airbreathing propulsion system includes an inlet assembly configured to receive an incoming airflow the inlet assembly including a left inlet and a right inlet each of the left and right inlets including an inboard surface at least partially shaped to conform to a plurality of streamline traces of a design flowfield downstream from an aperture an outboard surface spaced apart from the inboard surface the outboard surface comprising a movable high speed flap an upper surface extending between the inboard and outboard surfaces a lower surface extending between the inboard and outboard surfaces wherein leading edges of the inboard outboard upper and lower surfaces cooperatively define the aperture and a moveable low speed flap spaced apart in an inboard direction from the high speed flap. The system further including a low speed diffuser duct operatively coupled to the inlet assembly the moveable low speed flap being configured to at least partially control a first airflow into the low speed diffuser duct a high speed diffuser duct operatively coupled to the inlet assembly outboard from the low speed diffuser duct the moveable high speed flap being configured to at least partially control a second airflow into the high speed diffuser duct a low speed jet engine coupled to the low speed diffuser duct and a high speed jet engine coupled to the high speed diffuser duct.

The features functions and advantages that have been discussed can be achieved independently in various embodiments of the present invention or may be combined in yet other embodiments further details of which can be seen with reference to the following description and drawings.

The present invention relates to hypersonic inlet systems and methods. Many specific details of certain embodiments of the invention are set forth in the following description and in to provide a thorough understanding of such embodiments. The present invention however may have additional embodiments or may be practiced without one or more of the details described below.

As described above prior art turbine based combined cycle TBCC inlets have traditionally relied upon a more purely planar or two dimensional 2D geometry as integrated into an over under arrangement with the turbine flowpath being above the ramjet scramjet flowpath. Also the prior art approach generally had the turbine inlets external to and forward of the ramjet scramjet inlet while sharing a common external forebody which facilitated incorporation of planar variable geometry.

In general embodiments of the present invention anchor to a potentially higher performing streamline traced inlet from an axisymmetric flowfield while combining this with a rectangular aperture to facilitate planar variable geometry e.g. planar flaps without increasing mechanical complexity. By movement of one or more flaps each of the turbine inlets is moveable between a retracted position wherein there is relatively smaller or zero flow entering the turbine and a deflected position wherein there is relatively greater flow from the ramjet scramjet inlet entering the turbine. The resulting integration has the turbine and ramjet scramjet flowpaths side by side instead of one over the other.

In one particular embodiment the freestream Mach number of the design point overall flowfield is Mach 7. At a block a high speed aperture shape and aspect ratio AR are defined. The aperture shape may be rectangular and preferably provides adequate width and height to integrate low speed flaps. In one particular embodiment the aspect ratio AR is 4.3. A rectangular shape facilitates an effective integration of planar flaps for variable geometry although other shapes e.g. trapezoids non uniform shapes may be used. Other design Mach numbers and aperture dimension ratios do not depart from the scope of the invention.

The results of establishing the high speed inward turning design point overall flowfield block and defining the high speed aperture shape and aspect ratio AR block are used to trace streamlines around a perimeter of the aperture on the design flowfield at a block . As known to those skilled in the art the perimeter of the aperture is projected longitudinally to intersect with the flowfield definition particularly with the initial shock wave. Streamlines are then traced downstream from the points of intersection as they would flow in the established flowfield. The streamlines collectively define a streamtube forming a favorable inlet contour the inlet of one embodiment being shown in block of .

Next the resultant streamline traced inlet is split along its lateral centerline and the left and right halves are interchanged at a block . The interchanging of the halves may provide these advantages 1 a larger average width for incorporating the turbine inlet and duct without degrading performance 2 improved structural efficiency and avoidance of relatively thin cantilevered forward portions and 3 a more open inlet which may facilitate free bleed of flow and avoid trapping shock waves for improved operability. As further shown in the high speed and low speed inlet flap surfaces are defined at a block . Finally the high speed and low speed flap rotation schedules are established at a block . The flap schedules may be determined based on a variety of factors including freestream Mach number capture area to throat area contraction ratio AOA and airflow requirements of the turbojet.

Each inlet further includes a low speed inlet flap configured to selectively open and close a low speed diffuser duct leading to a turbojet engine . More specifically in an open position see lower flap of the low speed inlet flap is rotated outwardly so that a portion of the captured airflow may pass to the turbojet engine via the low speed diffuser duct while in a closed position see upper flap of the low speed inlet flap is rotated inwardly so that the entrance to the low speed diffuser duct is blocked. Thus the low speed inlet flap provides airflow capture and inlet operability control for the turbojet engine during low speed operation and transition.

As further shown in the centerbody may include one or more variable geometry regions . Preferably the variable geometry regions may be positioned proximate a throat region leading into the low speed diffuser duct and may be equipped with one or more bleed regions to enable proper control of the boundary layer particularly at locations proximate to normal or oblique shock wave boundary layer interactions. The variable geometry regions and bleed regions may improve controllability and performance of the inlet such as by permitting improved control of an expansion rate of the low speed e.g. subsonic flow entering the low speed diffuser duct . Other arrangements of components and variable geometry regions do not depart from the scope of this invention.

Each inlet further includes a high speed inlet flap positioned along an outboard edge of the inlet . The high speed inlet flap is configured to selectively deflect toward the centerbody to control airflow entering a high speed diffuser duct leading to a dual mode ramjet scramjet engine . More specifically in a deflected position see upper flap of the high speed inlet flap is rotated inwardly while in a retracted position see lower flap of the high speed inlet flap is rotated outwardly. In this way the high speed inlet flap controls inlet contraction ratio and operability during operation of the ramjet scramjet engines .

Embodiments of the present invention may advantageously provide a streamline traced hypersonic inlet which provides the necessary variable geometry without compromising overall system performance. Furthermore embodiments of the present invention may provide the desired inlet capabilities including supplying the required amount of air with adequate pressure recovery and sufficient operability margin for each propulsion system independently and also during propulsion system transition from low speed to high speed operating mode without a great deal of mechanical complexity.

It will be appreciated that a variety of alternate embodiments of the invention may be conceived and that the invention is not limited to the particular embodiments described above. In the following discussion of alternate embodiments components which remain unchanged from the previously described embodiments are designated with like reference numerals. For the sake of brevity only substantial structural and operational differences from the previously discussed embodiments will be described.

In a second mode of operation however the first portion remains fixed relative to the fixed cowl see lower flap of and the second portion pivots i.e. inwardly turns independently of the first portion . As shown in the second portion does not extend to the leading edge of the fixed cowl . Consequently in the deflected position see lower flap of the second portion of the high speed inlet flap controls an internal area distribution within a relatively smaller compression zone which in this embodiment is situated between the second portion and the low speed inlet flap .

In a second mode of operation however the first portion remains fixed relative to the fixed cowl see lower flap of and the second portion s are actuated e.g. by retracting fore or aft independently of the first portion to open up a bypass channel . Thus in the second mode of operation the second portion s allow some of the captured flow to be bypassed providing additional control of the flow entering the high speed diffuser duct .

While preferred and alternate embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described as noted above many changes can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly the scope of the invention is not limited by the disclosure of the preferred embodiment. Instead the invention should be determined entirely by reference to the claims that follow.
