title: Composite crest factor reduction
abstract: Systems and methods are provided for providing a hybrid signal having a reduced crest factor. A digital signal is generated that assumes one of a plurality of vector states at discrete sampling times, with each of the plurality of vector states having an associated phase. An analog signal is monitored to determine when a phase of the analog signal is aligned with the phase of a vector state assumed by the digital signal. A crest factor reduction is applied to the digital signal if the digital signal assumes a vector state having an associated phase aligned with the phase of the analog signal to provide a compressed digital signal. The compressed digital signal and the analog signal are combined to provide the hybrid signal. The analog signal is not altered prior to being combined with the compressed digital signal.

This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 11 168 705 which was filed Jun. 28 2005 now abandoned and titled COMPOSITE CREST FACTOR REDUCTION. The entire contents of that application are hereby incorporated by reference.

The present invention relates to RF communication systems and is particularly directed to systems and methods for producing a hybrid signal having a reduced crest factor.

The In Band On Channel IBOC digital audio broadcasting system proposed for usage in the USA places new requirements on broadcast transmitters. Foremost among these is linearity due to the fact IBOC digital audio modulation has amplitude components. The depth of this amplitude modulation contributes significantly to the cost of transmitter design as it is necessary to provide adequate headroom and linearity over the entire range of amplitude. Accordingly it is desirable to reduce this range a process referred to as crest factor reduction.

A digitally modulated signal is required to arrive at certain vector states e.g. signal envelope amplitude and phase at various digital sampling times within the signal. To the degree that the signal deviates from these states symbol detection errors can occur at an associated receiver. The extent of the crest factor reduction is generally limited by the expected tolerance of associated receivers for the distortion of the vector states. The distortion can be caused by direct compression at the symbol times or indirectly as a result of compressing the signal between sampling times.

In one example a hybrid signal can include a frequency modulated analog signal and a digital component. The digital signal transitions between a plurality of possible vector states of the digital component between discrete sample times associated with the hybrid signal such that the digital signal assumes one of the plurality of vector states at each sample time. It will be appreciated that during these transitions the hybrid signal can assume amplitudes significantly greater than its amplitude at the individual vector states. This results in an increased crest factor i.e. Peak to average power ratio of the signal which is undesirable. Previous attempts to reduce the crest factor of a hybrid signal have caused distortion of the vector states of the signal resulting in signal errors. Accordingly the extent of crest factor reduction possible for a given signal is limited by the amount of distortion that is allowable for a given application as well as by spectral regrowth constraints.

In accordance with an aspect of the present invention a method is provided for providing a hybrid signal having a reduced crest factor. A digital signal is generated that assumes one of a plurality of vector states at discrete sampling times with each of the plurality of vector states having an associated phase. An analog signal is monitored to determine when a phase of the analog signal is aligned with the phase of a vector state assumed by the digital signal. A crest factor reduction is applied to the digital signal if the digital signal assumes a vector state having an associated phase aligned with the phase of the analog signal to provide a compressed digital signal. The compressed digital signal and the analog signal are combined to provide the hybrid signal. The analog signal is not altered prior to being combined with the compressed digital signal.

In accordance with another aspect of the present invention a system is provided for producing a hybrid signal having a reduced crest factor. A digital exciter produces a digital signal that assumes one of a plurality of vector states at discrete sampling times associated with the digital signal. Each of the plurality of vector states has an associated phase. A limiting system is configured to monitor an analog signal to determine phase alignment of the analog signal relative to the vector state assumed by the digital signal and apply a crest factor reduction to the digital signal if the digital signal assumes a vector state having an associated phase aligned with the phase of the analog signal to provide a compressed digital signal. A signal combiner receives the analog signal in unaltered form as well as the compressed digital signal and combines the analog signal and the compressed digital signal to produce the hybrid signal.

An analog exciter provides a frequency modulated FM analog signal. The analog exciter can include a voltage controlled oscillator or a similar device for imposing a frequency modulation on a carrier signal. The FM analog signal is combined with the digital signal at a signal combiner . The signal combiner multiplexes the analog and digital signals into a hybrid signal in such a way as to avoid interference between the two signals. In an exemplary implementation the signal combiner sums the two signals.

The hybrid signal is subjected to a limiting function to compress any signal peaks above a desired amplitude. This limiting function is represented in the illustrated example as a soft limiter but it will be appreciated that the actual limiting function can be applied to the hybrid signal through a variety of means. For example the digital signal can be predistorted as to limit the expected amplitude of the hybrid signal by monitoring the analog signal and performing appropriate calculations of hybrid signal amplitude. Similarly an amplifier within the system can be selected to provide some or all of the limiting function to the signal. By limiting the hybrid signal the digital component to the signal can be significantly limited only when necessary to avoid a signal peak namely at those points wherein the phase of the digital component aligns with the phase of the analog signal. It will be appreciated that the soft limiter can also limit the signal a minimal amount even when the phase of the digital signal does not align with the analog signal. Once the hybrid signal has been limited it is amplified at the amplifier and provided to an associated transmitter not shown .

The digital signal component is predistorted at a digital predistorter to reduce the amplitude of the signal when the digital component assumes a vector state that is in phase with the analog carrier signal. The digital predistorter selectively compresses the digital component to produce a hybrid signal having a reduced crest factor. The predistorted digital signal is combined with the analog signal at a multiplexer to produce the hybrid signal. The hybrid signal is then amplified at a power amplifier . Additional compression can be applied to the hybrid signal at the power amplifier to further limit the crest factor of the hybrid signal.

The compressed bit stream is then provided to a forward error correction and interleaving component . The forward error correction and interleaving component codes the signal for later error correction to improve the reliability of the information transmitted in the digital signal. The forward error coding can include for example Reed Solomon encoding and Trellis coding. The data interleaving spreads related data over time and frequency to mitigate the effects of burst errors in the transmitted signal. The coded signal is then provided to an orthogonal frequency division multiplexer that assigns the interleaved data to various orthogonal subchannels and combines the subchannels into a modulated signal. This signal is then provided to an upconverter that upconverts the signal to a radio frequency.

An analog exciter produces a frequency modulated analog signal from an analog carrier signal having an associated phase. The frequency modulated analog signal and the coded signal are provided to a multiplexer . The multiplexer combines the two signals to form a hybrid signal. The signals are combined in such a way as to minimize interference between the signals. The hybrid signal is provided to a soft limiter .

The soft limiter compresses the hybrid signal as to limit its maximum amplitude. Effectively the soft limiter compresses the hybrid signal maximally when it is at its peak amplitude which occurs wherever the digital signal and the analog signal are in phase. In an exemplary embodiment the soft limiter can be implemented as a limiter and a band pass filter. These elements can be cascaded repeatedly to improve the performance of the soft filter. It will be appreciated that this can be accomplished by other means such as predistorting the digital signal as to reduce its amplitude when the digital signal is in phase with the analog carrier.

The signal is then provided to a power amplifier . The power amplifier amplifies the signal to an appropriate level for transmission and provides the signal to an associated antenna . In an exemplary implementation the power amplifier can provide some or all of the signal compression supplementing or replacing the soft limiter .

In view of the foregoing structural and functional features described above a methodology in accordance with various aspects of the present invention will be better appreciated with reference to . While for purposes of simplicity of explanation the methodology of is shown and described as executing serially it is to be understood and appreciated that the present invention is not limited by the illustrated order as some aspects could in accordance with the present invention occur in different orders and or concurrently with other aspects from that shown and described herein. Moreover not all illustrated features may be required to implement a methodology in accordance with an aspect the present invention.

At step a frequency modulated analog signal is generated. At step the analog signal and the digital signal are combined to form a hybrid signal. The signals are generated and combined as to avoid interference. The hybrid signal is compressed at step to limit the crest factor of the hybrid signal. For example the hybrid signal can be limited at a soft limiter or an amplifier or the digital signal can be predistorted to reduce its amplitude when it assumes the same phase as the analog carrier. The compressed signal can then be amplified and broadcast.
