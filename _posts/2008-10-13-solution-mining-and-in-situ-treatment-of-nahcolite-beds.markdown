title: Solution mining and in situ treatment of nahcolite beds
abstract: A method for treating a nahcolite containing subsurface formation includes solution mining a first nahcolite bed above a hydrocarbon containing layer using a plurality of first solution mining wells. A second nahcolite bed is solution mined below the hydrocarbon containing layer using a plurality of second solution mining wells. At least one of the first solution mining wells is converted into a production well. The hydrocarbon containing layer is heated using a plurality of heaters. Formation fluid is produced from at least one converted first solution mining well.
