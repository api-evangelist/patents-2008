Cancer is one of the most significant health conditions. The American Cancer Society s 2003 predicts over 1.3 million Americans will receive a cancer diagnosis this year. In the United States cancer is second only to heart disease in mortality accounting for one of four deaths. In 2002 the National Institutes of Health estimated total costs of cancer totaled 171.6 billion with 61 billion in direct expenditures. The incidence of cancer is widely expected to increase as the US population ages further augmenting the impact of this condition. The current treatment regimens for cancer established in the 1970s and 1980s have not changed dramatically. These treatments which include chemotherapy radiation and other modalities including newer targeted therapies have shown limited overall survival benefit when utilized in most advanced stage common cancers since among other things these therapies primarily target tumor bulk.

More specifically conventional cancer diagnosis and therapies to date have attempted to selectively detect and eradicate neoplastic cells that are largely fast growing i.e. cells that form the tumor bulk . Standard oncology regimens have often been largely designed to administer the highest dose of irradiation or a chemotherapeutic agent without undue toxicity i.e. often referred to as the maximum tolerated dose MTD or no observed adverse effect level NOAEL . Many conventional cancer chemotherapies e.g. alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide antimetabolites such as 5 Fluorouracil and plant alkaloids such as vincristine and conventional irradiation therapies exert their toxic effects on cancer cells largely by interfering with cellular mechanisms involved in cell growth and DNA replication. Chemotherapy protocols also often involve administration of a combination of chemotherapeutic agents in an attempt to increase the efficacy of treatment. Despite the availability of a large variety of chemotherapeutic agents these therapies have many drawbacks see e.g. Stockdale 1998 Principles Of Cancer Patient Management in Scientific American Medicine vol. 3 Rubenstein and Federman eds. ch. 12 sect. X . For example chemotherapeutic agents are notoriously toxic due to non specific side effects on fast growing cells whether normal or malignant e.g. chemotherapeutic agents cause significant and often dangerous side effects including bone marrow depression immunosuppression and gastrointestinal distress etc.

Other types of traditional cancer therapies include surgery hormonal therapy immunotherapy anti angiogenesis therapy targeted therapy e.g. therapy directed to a cancer target such as Gleevec and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors Velcade Sutent et al. and radiation treatment to eradicate neoplastic cells in a patient see e.g. Stockdale 1998 Principles of Cancer Patient Management in Scientific American Medicine vol. 3 Rubenstein and Federman eds. ch. 12 sect. IV . All of these approaches can pose significant drawbacks for the patient including a lack of efficacy in terms of long term outcome e.g. due to failure to target cancer stem cells and toxicity e.g. due to non specific effects on normal tissues . Accordingly new therapies for improving the long term prospect of cancer patients are needed.

Cancer stem cells comprise a unique subpopulation often 0.1 10 or so of a tumor that relative to the remaining 90 or so of the tumor i.e. the tumor bulk are more tumorigenic relatively more slow growing or quiescent and often relatively more chemoresistant than the tumor bulk. Given that conventional therapies and regimens have in large part been designed to attack rapidly proliferating cells i.e. those cancer cells that comprise the tumor bulk cancer stem cells which are often slow growing may be relatively more resistant than faster growing tumor bulk to conventional therapies and regimens. Cancer stem cells can express other features which make them relatively chemoresistant such as multi drug resistance and anti apoptotic pathways. The aforementioned would constitute a key reason for the failure of standard oncology treatment regimens to ensure long term benefit in most patients with advanced stage cancers i.e. the failure to adequately target and eradicate cancer stem cells. In some instances a cancer stem cell s is the founder cell of a tumor i.e. it is the progenitor of the cancer cells that comprise the tumor bulk .

Cancer stem cells have been identified in a large variety of cancer types. For instance Bonnet et al. using flow cytometry were able to isolate the leukemia cells bearing the specific phenotype CD34 CD38 and subsequently demonstrate that it is these cells comprising 

Cox et al. identified small subfractions of human acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL cells which had the phenotypes CD34 CD10 and CD34 CD19 and were capable of engrafting ALL tumors in immunocompromised mice i.e. the cancer stem cells. In contrast no engraftment of the mice was observed using the ALL bulk despite in some cases injecting 10 fold more cells. See Cox et al. Characterization of acute lymphoblastic leukemia progenitor cells 104 19 2919 2925 2004 .

Multiple myeloma was found to contain small subpopulations of cells that were CD138 and relative to the large bulk population of CD138 myeloma cells had greater clonogenic and tumorigenic potential. See Matsui et al. Characterization of clonogenic multiple myeloma cells 103 6 2332. The authors concluded that the CD138 subpopulation of multiple myeloma was the cancer stem cell population.

Kondo et al. isolated a small population of cells from a C6 glioma cell line which was identified as the cancer stem cell population by virtue of its ability to self renew and recapitulate gliomas in immunocompromised mice. See Kondo et al. Persistence of a small population of cancer stem like cells in the C6 glioma cell line 101 781 786 2004 . In this study Kondo et al. determined that cancer cell lines contain a population of cancer stem cells that confer the ability of the line to engraft immunodeficient mice.

Breast cancers were shown to contain a small population of cells with stem cell characteristics bearing surface markers CD44 CD24 . See Al Hajj et al. Prospective identification of tumorigenic breast cancer cells 100 3983 3988 2003 . As few as 200 of these cells corresponding to 1 10 of the total tumor cell population are able to form tumors in NOD SCID mice. In contrast implantation of 20 000 cells that lacked this phenotype i.e. the tumor bulk was unable to re grow the tumor.

A subpopulation of cells derived from human prostate tumors was found to self renew and to recapitulate the phenotype of the prostate tumor from which they were derived thereby constituting the prostate cancer stem cell population. See Collins et al. Prospective Identification of Tumorigenic Prostate Cancer Stem Cells 65 23 10946 10951 2005 .

Fang et al. isolated a subpopulation of cells from melanoma with cancer stem cell properties. In particular this subpopulation of cells could differentiate and self renew. In culture the subpopulation formed spheres whereas the more differentiated cell fraction from the lesions were more adherent. Moreover the subpopulation containing sphere like cells were more tumorigenic than the adherent cells when grafted into mice. See Fang et al. A Tumorigenic Subpopulation with Stem Cell Properties in Melanomas 65 20 9328 9337 2005 .

Singh et al. identified brain tumor stem cells. When isolated and transplanted into nude mice the CD133 cancer stem cells unlike the CD133 tumor bulk cells form tumors that can then be serially transplanted. See Singh et al. Identification of human brain tumor initiating cells 432 396 401 2004 Singh et al. Cancer stem cells in nervous system tumors 23 7267 7273 2004 Singh et al. Identification of a cancer stem cell in human brain tumors 63 5821 5828 2003 .

Since conventional cancer therapies target rapidly proliferating cells i.e. cells that form the tumor bulk these treatments are believed to be relatively ineffective at targeting and impairing cancer stem cells. In fact cancer stem cells including leukemia stem cells have indeed been shown to be relatively resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic therapies e.g. Ara C daunorubicin as well as newer targeted therapies e.g. Gleevec Velcade . Examples of cancer stem cells from various tumors that are resistant to chemotherapy and the mechanism by which they are resistant are described in Table 1 below.

For example leukemic stem cells are relatively slow growing or quiescent express multi drug resistance genes and utilize other anti apoptotic mechanisms features which contribute to their chemoresistance. See Jordan et al. Targeting the most critical cells approaching leukemia therapy as a problem in stem cell biology Nat. Clin. Pract. Oncol. 2 224 225 2005 . Further cancer stem cells by virtue of their chemoresistance may contribute to treatment failure and may also persist in a patient after clinical remission and these remaining cancer stem cells may therefore contribute to relapse at a later date. See Behbood et al. Will cancer stem cells provide new therapeutic targets Carcinogenesis 26 4 703 711 2004 . Therefore targeting cancer stem cells is expected to provide for improved long term outcomes for cancer patients. Accordingly new therapeutic agents and or regimens designed to target cancer stem cells are needed to reach this goal.

Approximately forty thousand patients per year develop acute myeloid leukemia AML in the U.S. Canada and Europe. See e.g. Jamal et al. 56 106 130 2006 . AML is the most common leukemia in adults and the second most common leukemia in children. The prolonged hospitalizations associated with treatment and complications represent a significant share of health care costs in these regions. Further even with combination induction and consolidation chemotherapy most patients ultimately relapse and die from their disease or complications of treatment. See e.g. Brune et al. Improved leukemia free survival after post consolidation immunotherapy with histamine dihydrochloride and interleukin 2 in acute myeloid leukemia results of a randomized phase III trial 108 1 88 96 2006 . Novel therapies are urgently needed. Selective targeting of AML cells stem cells may provide a safe and more effective therapy.

There are approximately 20 000 new cases of myelodysplastic syndrome MDS each year in the U.S. Patients with myelodysplastic syndromes typically have low blood cell counts in at least one or more of red blood cells white blood cells and platelets. Upon examination the bone marrow usually is found to be dysplastic or hyperplastic meaning there are too many poorly functioning blood stem cells in the marrow. A small percentage of MDS patients have hypoplastic bone marrow meaning there are too few blood stem cells in the marrow which make the disease look similar to aplastic anemia. Nearly half of people with MDS have no symptoms at time of diagnosis. When signs and symptoms do occur they can include anemia weakness fatigue headache bruising increased bleeding rash fevers mouth sores and lingering illness. MDS occurs at an increasing frequency in older people but it can occur in children too. In less than a third of patients MDS progresses over time to become acute leukemia. The average age of diagnosis is 70 years old. Treatments for MDS may vary considerably depending on the type of MDS the history of the patient and the age and ability to tolerate certain treatment regimens. Treatment options include supportive care chemotherapy related agents and stem cell transplantation which is typically used only in patients under 50 . However the remission rate for existing treatments in relatively low and new therapies are needed.

Interleukin 3 IL 3 is a cytokine that supports the proliferation and differentiation of multipotential and committed myeloid and lymphoid progenitors but is not required for growth and differentiation of normal stem cells and mature myeloid cells. See e.g. Nitsche et al. Interleukin 3 promotes proliferation and differentiation of human hematopoietic stem cells but reduces their repopulation potential in NOD SCID mice 21 236 244 2003 .

Human IL 3 mediates its effects by binding to the human IL 3 receptor which is a heterodimer consisting of an IL 3 binding alpha subunit IL3R CD123 and a common beta subunit IL3R . The alpha subunit of IL3R is essential for ligand binding and specificity. The subunit is essential for ligand binding and confers specificity on the receptor. The subunit is also shared by the granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor GM CSF and IL 5 receptors and is required for high affinity ligand binding and signal transduction.

The alpha subunit of the human IL 3 receptor is strongly expressed in 45 95 of AML 40 100 of B cell lineage acute lymphocytic leukemia B ALL and 85 of hairy cell leukemia HCL . See e.g. Graf et al. Expression and prognostic value of hemopoietic cytokine receptors in acute myeloid leukemia AML implications for future therapeutical strategies 72 89 106 2004 Jordan et al. The IL 3 receptor alpha subunit alpha chain is a unique marker for human acute myelogenous leukemia stem cells 14 1777 1784 2000 Munoz et al. IL 3 receptor alpha subunit alpha chain CD123 is widely expressed in hematologic malignancies 86 1261 1269 2001 Testa et al. Elevated expression of IL 3R alpha in acute myelogenous leukemia is associated with enhanced blast proliferation increased cellularity and poor prognosis 100 2980 2988 2002 . The common subunit of the IL 3 receptor is shared by the IL 3 granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor GM CSF and IL 5 receptors. See e.g. Testa et al. IL 3 receptor alpha subunit in acute leukemia 18 219 226 2004 . The expression of IL3R is elevated in the primitive LSC population CD34 CD38 in AML chronic myelogenous leukemia CML and some other myeloid malignancies but is not detectable in normal hematopoietic cells and progenitors. See e.g. Florian et al. Detection of molecular targets on the surface of CD34 CD38 stem cells in various myeloid malignancies 47 207 222 2006 Jordan et al. 2000 above Hogge et al. Variant Diphtheria Toxin Interleukin 3 Conjugates with Increased Receptor Affinity Have Enhanced Cytotoxicity against Acute Myeloid Leukemia Progenitors 12 1284 1291 2004 . Thus IL3R appears to be an excellent target for the therapy of leukemias.

 Percent Identity To determine the percent identity of amino acid sequences or their encoding nucleic acid sequences the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes e.g. gaps can be introduced in the sequence of a first amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment with a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence . The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence then the molecules are identical at that position. The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences i.e. identity number of identical overlapping positions total number of positions 100 . In one embodiment the two sequences are the same length. The determination of percent identity between two sequences can also be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. A preferred non limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of two sequences is the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul Methods for assessing the statistical significance of molecular sequence features by using general scoring schemes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87 2264 2268 1990 modified as in Karlin and Altschul Applications and statistics for multiple high scoring segments in molecular sequences Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 5873 5877 1993 . Such an algorithm is incorporated into the BLASTN and BLASTX programs of Altschul et al. Basic local alignment search tool J. Mol. Biol. 215 403 410 1990 . BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the BLASTN nucleotide program with parameters set e.g. for score 100 word size 12 to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to nucleic acid molecules of the present invention. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the BLASTX program with parameters set e.g. to score 50 word size 3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to a protein molecule of the present invention. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul et al. Gapped BLAST and PSI BLAST a new generation of protein database search programs Nucleic Acids Res. 25 3389 3402 1997 . Alternatively PSI BLAST can be used to perform an iterated search which detects distant relationships between molecules Id. . When utilizing BLAST Gapped BLAST and PSI BLAST programs the default parameters of the respective programs e.g. of BLASTX and BLASTN can be used see e.g. the National Center for Biotechnology Information website http www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov BLAST . Another preferred non limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of sequences is the algorithm of Myers and Miller Optimal alignments in linear space Comput. Appl. Biosci. 4 11 17 1988 . Such an algorithm is incorporated in the ALIGN program version 2.0 which is part of the GCG bioinformatics software package Accelrys . When utilizing the ALIGN program for comparing amino acid sequences a PAM120 weight residue table gap length penalty of 12 and gap penalty of 4 can be used.

The percent identity between two sequences can be determined using techniques similar to those described above with or without allowing gaps. In calculating percent identity typically only exact matches are counted.

The present invention provides antibody conjugates that bind to the IL3R chain preferably the human IL3R chain . In some embodiments the antibody conjugates of the present invention comprise an antibody that binds to the IL3R chain expressed on the surface of cells conjugated to a cytotoxic agent or other moiety e.g. an anticellular moiety . In some embodiments the antibody conjugates of the present invention comprise an antibody that binds to the extracellular domain of the IL3R chain conjugated to a cytotoxic agent or other moiety e.g. an anticellular moiety . In a specific embodiment the antibody conjugate of the invention is an immunotoxin. In one embodiment the antibody is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent or otherwise anticellular agent either directly or through a chemical linker. In another embodiment the antibody is linked to the cytotoxic agent or otherwise anticellular moiety through a chemical covalent bond such as a peptide bond with or without a peptide linker disulfide bond or sterically hindered disulfide bond. The antibody can be linked at its amino terminus or its carboxyl terminus to the cytotoxic agent or otherwise anticellular moiety. Alternatively the antibody can replace a domain of the cytotoxic agent or otherwise anticellular moiety that is not required for cytotoxicity so long as antibody retains its specificity for the IL3R chain.

In certain embodiments an antibody conjugate comprises an IL3R antibody linked via a peptide linker also referred to as a spacer to a cytotoxic agent or an otherwise anticellular moiety. The linker for the conjugate may be 5 8 10 12 15 25 50 or 75 amino acids in length but the length may otherwise vary to provide optimal binding of the conjugate to IL3R . In a specific embodiment the peptide linker is 6 or 7 amino acids long. In another embodiment the amino terminus of an IL3R antibody is attached to a cytotoxic agent or an otherwise anticellular moiety through the peptide linker Ser Gly Ser. In another embodiment the carboxyl terminus of an IL3R antibody is linked to a cytotoxic agent or an otherwise anticellular moiety through a Lys Ala Ser Gly Gly Pro Glu linker. The constituent amino acids of a spacer may be selected to influence some property of the conjugate such as its folding net charge or hydrophobicity. Linker molecules are commonly known in the art and described in Denardo et al. 19984 2483 90 Peterson et al. 199910 553 and Zimmerman et al. 199926 943 50 each incorporated by reference in their entireties.

An antibody conjugate of the invention may be composed of one or two polypeptide chains together comprising the antibody moiety and the cytotoxic agent or anticellular moiety. In one embodiment the cytotoxic agent is attached to the variable heavy V region of an Fv antibody fragment against IL3R where the Vregion is bound by an amino acid linker to the variable light V chain region. In another embodiment the cytotoxic agent is attached to the Vregion of an Fv antibody against IL3R where the Vregion is bound to a Vchain region through at least one disulfide linkage e.g. formed between respective cysteines in each chain . Disulfide linked Fv chains may have a reduced tendency to aggregate show a generally longer serum half life and are said to be stabilized. Thus a disulfide stabilized antibody cytotoxin conjugate comprises at least two polypeptides linked by at least one disulfide linkage. The two polypeptides can be separated by a termination codon and downstream initiation codon and ribosome binding site so that the chains are encoded as separate open reading frames or they can be joined by a peptide linker. In another embodiment the cytotoxic agent is attached to the Vregion of an Fv antibody against IL3R where the Vregion is bound through a peptide linker and at least one disulfide bond to a Vchain region. In a specific embodiment the cytotoxic agent is attached to Vregion of an Fv antibody against IL3R where the Vregion is bound by a linker to the Vchain region. In another embodiment the cytotoxic agent is attached to the Vregion of an Fv antibody against IL3R where the Vregion is bound through at least one disulfide bond to a Vchain region. In another embodiment the cytotoxic agent is attached to the Vregion of an Fv antibody against IL3R where the Vregion is bound through a peptide linker and at least one disulfide bond to a Vchain region. In yet another embodiment of the invention the Vand Vsequences will be followed respectively by part or all of the light and heavy chain constant regions e.g. the whole kappa light chain constant region and the Cdomain of the heavy chain constant region with or without the heavy chain hinge domain. Thus the antibody segments and genes encoding the cytotoxic agent may occur in any order on a single plasmid or may be expressed separately from separate plasmids. For example in another embodiment of the invention the Vgene and any light chain constant region will be on one plasmid while the Vgene any heavy chain constant region and the gene for a proteinaceous cytotoxin will be on a second plasmid. In either case the Vand or Vgenes may be preceded by a signal sequence that directs the secretion of the recombinant fusion protein from the cell. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 147 203 6 074 644 and 6 051 405 which are referenced herein in their entirety.

In another embodiment the polypeptide chains expressed by the plasmid may be sequestered in inclusion bodies that are retained within the cell. The polypeptides may be expressed in a variety of expression systems that are routinely available to one skilled in the art including bacterial expression systems such as and yeast expression systems such as . See e.g. Vrieto et al. 2004 Protein Expression and Purification 33 1123 133 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for methods of expressing polypeptides sequestered in inclusion bodies.

In another embodiment this invention provides for single chain antibody conjugates in which the antibody comprises the Vor Vregions alone rather than as components of Fv fragments. The amino terminus or carboxyl terminus of the variable chain is then conjugated to a selected cytotoxic agent such conjugation may be through a peptide linker. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 074 644 which is referenced herein in its entirety.

Antibodies or the encoded antibodies cytotoxic agents or antibody conjugates may be altered by being subjected to random mutagenesis by error prone PCR random nucleotide insertion or other methods prior to recombination. A polynucleotide encoding an IL3R antibody may be recombined with one or more components motifs sections parts domains fragments etc. of one or more cytotoxin molecules.

The invention provides nucleic acids comprising nucleotide sequences encoding an antibody conjugate of the invention. The invention also provides nucleic acids comprising a nucleotide sequence that encode the antibody moiety and or the proteinaceous cytotoxic agent of an antibody conjugate of the invention. Thus for example in one embodiment the invention provides for a nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody conjugate comprising a Vregion of an Fv fragment attached to a proteinaceous cytotoxic agent e.g. exotoxin . The nucleotides that encode the Vregion are linked to the nucleotides that encode the Vregion through nucleotides that encode a peptide linker. Alternatively or in combination the encoded Vregion contains cysteine residues that form disulfide linkages with a Vregion of an Fv fragment. In another embodiment the invention provides for nucleic acids comprising nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody conjugate of the invention in which the Vchain is substituted for the Vchain and vice versa. In another embodiment the invention provides for nucleic acids comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody conjugate in which the antibody comprises the Vor Vregion alone. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 074 644 which is referenced herein in its entirety.

In a particular embodiment the cytotoxicity of a particular antibody cytotoxin conjugate is measured by a cell viability assay using cell lines that express IL3R e.g. TF 1 Molm 13 or Molm 14 . In a particular embodiment cell viability is tested using an assay in which cells are seeded into 96 well plates at a concentration of 2 10of cells well. Serial dilutions of antibody conjugates in 0.2 human serum albumin HSA are added to the cells resulting in final concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1000 ng ml in 150 l. After incubation for 48 hours 10 l of WST 8 Dojindo Molecular Technologies is added to each well and the incubation is carried out for 4 hours at 37 C. The absorbance of the sample at 450 nm is measured with a reference wavelength of 650 nm. Cytotoxicity is defined by IC 50 inhibition of cell viability which is midway between the level of viability in the absence of antibody conjugate and that in the presence of 10 g ml cycloheximide.

The present invention also provides for panels of antibody conjugates that bind to the IL3R chain. In specific embodiments the invention provides for panels of antibody conjugates having different affinities for the IL3R chain different specificities for the IL3R chain and or different dissociation rates.

In particular antibodies of the present invention include immunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin molecules i.e. molecules that contain an antigen binding site that binds to an IL3R antigen. The immunoglobulin molecules of the invention can be of any type e.g. IgG IgE IgM IgD IgA and IgY class e.g. IgG IgG IgG IgG IgA and IgA or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule. In a specific embodiment an antibody of the invention is an IgG antibody. In another specific embodiment an antibody of the invention is not an IgA antibody.

The antibodies of the present invention may be monospecific bispecific trispecific or of greater multispecificity. Multispecific antibodies may be specific for different epitopes of an IL3R polypeptide or may be specific for both an IL3R polypeptide as well as for a heterologous epitope such as a heterologous polypeptide or solid support material as long as such epitopes are not found in human tissues. See e.g. PCT publications WO 93 17715 WO 92 08802 WO 91 00360 and WO 92 05793 Tutt et al. 147 60 69 1991 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 474 893 4 714 681 4 925 648 5 573 920 and 5 601 819 and Kostelny et al. 148 1547 1553 1992 .

In one embodiment antibodies of the invention bind to cells that express IL3R chain preferably human IL3R chain . In a specific embodiment antibodies of the invention bind to a fragment of the IL3R chain comprising 8 to 285 8 to 275 8 to 250 8 to 200 8 to 175 8 to 150 8 to 100 8 to 50 8 to 25 15 to 50 15 to 75 15 to 100 or 15 to 150 amino acids of the extracellular domain of the mature IL3R chain preferably the mature human IL3R chain s. In another embodiment the antibodies of the invention bind to the extracellular domain of the human IL3R chain or a fragment thereof.

An antibody of the invention may be composed of one or two polypeptide chains. In one embodiment an Fv antibody that binds to the IL3R chain is composed of a single polypeptide chain where the Vregion is bound by an amino acid linker to the Vchain region. In a preferred embodiment such scFvs are stable at 37 C. for about 2 minutes 5 minutes 10 minutes 15 minutes 20 minutes 25 minutes 30 minutes 1 hour 1.5 hours 2 hours 3 hours 4 hours 5 hours 6 hours 7 hours 12 hours 14 hours 24 hours 48 hours 1 week 2 weeks 1 month 3 months 6 months 1 year or longer as assessed by a technique known to one of skill in the art or described herein. In another embodiment the Vregion of an Fv antibody that binds to the IL3R chain is bound to a Vchain region through at least one disulfide linkage e.g. formed between respective cysteines in each chain . In certain embodiments the disulfide linked Fv chains have a reduced tendency to aggregate as measured by e.g. HPLC and have a longer serum half life. Thus in a specific embodiment a disulfide stabilized Fv dsFv antibody comprises at least two polypeptides linked by at least one disulfide linkage. The two polypeptides can be separated by a termination codon and downstream initiation codon and ribosome binding site so that the chains are encoded as separate open reading frames or they can be additionally joined by a peptide linker. In order to provide disulfide covalent bonds between the Vand Vchains of dsFv fragments cysteine residues are necessary. Cysteine residues can be introduced in the proper position of each Vand V determined by alignment to reference sequences by standard molecular biology techniques e.g. site directed mutagenesis . See Pastan et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 147 203 which is incorporate by reference herein in its entirety especially columns 5 7.

In another embodiment the Vand Vsequences will be followed respectively by part or all of the light and heavy chain constant regions e.g. the whole kappa light chain constant region and the Cdomain of the heavy chain constant region with or without the heavy chain hinge domain. Thus the genes encoding the antibody segments may occur in any order on a single plasmid or may be expressed separately from separate plasmids. For example in another embodiment of the invention the Vgene and any light chain constant region will be on one plasmid while the Vgene and any heavy chain constant region will be on a second plasmid. In either case the Vand or Vgenes may be preceded by a signal sequence that directs the secretion of the recombinant fusion protein from the cell. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 147 203 6 074 644 6 051 405 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

In another embodiment the invention provides for single chain antibodies in which the antibody comprises the Vor Vregions alone rather than as components of Fv fragments. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 074 644 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

An antibody can also be conjugated to a second antibody to form an antibody heteroconjugate as described by Segal in U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In a specific embodiment two or more antibodies are cross linked to each to produce a bispecific or multispecific antibody.

In one embodiment an antibody of the invention is not only found to be specific for IL3R but also binds with very high affinity based on binding assays using IL3R expressing cell lines. In another embodiment an antibody of the invention is not only found to be specific for IL3R but also binds an epitope that overlaps with that bound by the 26292 antibody. In other embodiments an antibody of the invention is not only found to be specific for IL3R but also binds an epitope that overlaps with that bound by the 32703 32701 or 32716 antibody.

The present invention is based in part upon the discovery that even though a particular anti IL3R antibody might bind to IL3R specifically and with high affinity that does not guarantee that it will constitute an effective immunotoxin when linked to a cytotoxic agent. In one embodiment antibodies with high affinity and specificity are chosen for conjugation to a cytotoxic agent and they are then assessed for their ability to selectively and potently kill IL3R expressing cells. In a specific embodiment the IL3R antibody binds an epitope that overlaps that of an antibody known to cause specific cytotoxicity to IL3R expressing cells. For example in one embodiment an IL3R antibody is tested for epitope overlap with the anti IL3R antibody 26292 as assessed by the following competition assay Cells that bear IL3R e.g. TF 1 Molm 13 or Molm 14 are incubated with an excess of the 26292 antibody for 1 hour at 4 C. followed by incubation for 1 hour with an excess of the second IL3R antibody. If the two antibodies bind to an overlapping epitope the amount bound by the combination will be close to that of either single antibody whereas if the two antibodies bind to different epitopes the signal from the combination would be close to the sum of two individual values. Bound antibody is detected with the fluorescently labeled secondary antibody R PE phycoerythrin labeled goat F ab anti rabbit IgG BioSource or other appropriate specific fluorescently labeled probe. In other embodiments an IL3R antibody is tested for epitope overlap with the anti IL3R antibody 32703 32701 or 32716.

In one embodiment an IL3R antibody binds to the same epitope as the 26292 32703 32701 or 32716 antibody as assessed by a competition assay known to one of skill in the art or described herein. In another alternative embodiment the IL3R antibody does not bind to the same epitope as the 26292 32703 32701 or 32716 antibody as assessed by a competition assay known to one of skill in the art or described herein.

In another embodiment of this invention the anti IL3R antibody competes with IL 3 for binding to IL3R or a fragment thereof e.g. the extracellular domain of the IL3R or a fragment thereof .

See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 074 644 which is referenced herein in its entirety.

Those skilled in the art will realize that additional modifications deletions insertions and the like may be made to the IL3R antibody. Especially deletions or other changes may be made to the antibody in order to increase stability affinity specificity or when combined with the cytotoxic agent cytotoxicity or other impairment to IL3R expressing cells and or to decrease non specific cytotoxicity or impairment toward cells that lack IL3R antigens. Typical modifications include but are not limited to introduction of an upstream methionine for transcription initiation mutation of residues to cysteine in Vor Vregions for the creation of disulfide linkages etc. All such constructions may be made by methods of genetic engineering well known to those skilled in the art. Fragments analogs and derivatives of IL3R antibodies can be useful in the present invention provided that when fused to the cytotoxic agent portion of the conjugate such fragments analogs and derivatives maintain the ability to bind native IL3R expressed on the surface of a cell. Preferably the binding kinetics of the fragments analogs or derivatives remain the same or vary by no more than 25 preferably no more than 15 10 or 5 as determined by an assays described herein.

To improve or alter the characteristics of IL3R antibodies protein engineering may be employed. Recombinant DNA technology known to those skilled in the art can be used to create novel mutant proteins or muteins including single or multiple amino acid substitutions deletions additions or fusion proteins. Such modified polypeptides can show e.g. enhanced activity or increased stability. In addition they may be purified in higher yields and show better solubility than the corresponding natural polypeptide at least under certain purification and storage conditions. For instance for many proteins it is known in the art that one or more amino acids may be deleted from the amino terminus or carboxyl terminus without substantial loss of biological function.

Antibodies may be altered by random mutagenesis by error prone PCR random nucleotide insertion or other methods prior to recombination.

The present invention also provides antibodies that bind to the IL3R chain the antibodies comprising derivatives of the Vdomains VCDRs Vdomains and VCDRs described herein. Standard techniques known to those of skill in the art can be used to introduce mutations in the nucleotide sequence encoding a molecule of the invention including for example site directed mutagenesis and PCR mediated mutagenesis which results in amino acid substitutions. Preferably the derivatives include less than 25 amino acid substitutions less than 20 amino acid substitutions less than 15 amino acid substitutions less than 10 amino acid substitutions less than 5 amino acid substitutions less than 4 amino acid substitutions less than 3 amino acid substitutions or less than 2 amino acid substitutions relative to the original molecule. In a preferred embodiment the derivatives have conservative amino acid substitutions are made at one or more predicted non essential amino acid residues. A conservative amino acid substitution is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a side chain with a similar charge. Families of amino acid residues having side chains with similar charges have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains e.g. lysine arginine histidine acidic side chains e.g. aspartic acid glutamic acid uncharged polar side chains e.g. glycine asparagine glutamine serine threonine tyrosine cysteine non polar side chains e.g. alanine valine leucine isoleucine proline phenylalanine methionine tryptophan beta branched side chains e.g. threonine valine isoleucine and aromatic side chains e.g. tyrosine phenylalanine tryptophan histidine . Alternatively mutations can be introduced randomly along all or part of the coding sequence such as by saturation mutagenesis and the resultant mutants can be screened for biological activity to identify mutants that retain activity. Following mutagenesis the encoded protein can be expressed and the activity of the protein can be determined.

In ricin and abrin the binding and toxic functions are contained in two separate protein subunits the A and B chains. The ricin B chain binds to the cell surface carbohydrates and promotes the uptake of the A chain into the cell. Once inside the cell the ricin A chain inhibits protein synthesis by inactivating the 60S subunit of the eukaryotic ribosome Endo et al.

Ricin has been used therapeutically by binding its toxic a chain to targeting molecules such as Abs to enable site specific delivery of the toxic effect. Bacterial toxins have also been used as anti tumor conjugates. As intended herein a toxic peptide chain or domain is conjugated to a compound of this invention and delivered in a site specific manner to a target site where the toxic activity is desired such as a metastatic focus.

Alternatively PCR amplification of gene fragments can be carried out using anchor primers that give rise to complementary overhangs between two consecutive gene fragments which can subsequently be annealed and re amplified to generate a chimeric gene sequence see e.g. Ausubel et al. eds. John Wiley Sons 1992 .

The nucleotide sequences encoding a conjugate or portion thereof of the invention anti IL3R antibody and or proteinaceous cytotoxin sequences such as but not limited to exotoxin or diphtheria toxin may be obtained from any information available to those of skill in the art i.e. from GenBank the literature or by routine cloning . The nucleotide sequence coding for a conjugate or for the antibody or cytotoxin moiety of the conjugate can be inserted into an appropriate expression vector i.e. a vector that contains the necessary elements for the transcription and translation of the inserted protein coding sequence. A variety of host vector systems may be utilized in the present invention to express the protein coding sequence. These include but are not limited to mammalian cell systems infected with virus e.g. vaccinia virus adenovirus etc. insect cell systems infected with virus e.g. baculovirus microorganisms such as yeast containing yeast vectors or bacteria transformed with bacteriophage DNA plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA. The expression elements of vectors vary in their strengths and specificities. Depending on the host vector system utilized any one of a number of suitable transcription and translation elements may be used.

The expression of a conjugate or a portion thereof of the invention may be controlled by any promoter or enhancer element known in the art. Promoters that may be used to control expression of a conjugate or its parts include but are not limited to the SV40 early promoter region Bernoist and Chambon 1981 Nature 290 304 310 the promoter contained in the 3 long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus Yamamoto et al. 1980 Cell 22 787 797 the herpes thymidine kinase promoter Wagner et al. 1981 Proc.

Virol. 80 571 83 and gonadotropic releasing hormone gene control region which is active in the hypothalamus Mason et al. 1986 Science 234 1372 1378 . In a specific embodiment the expression of a conjugate of the invention is regulated by a constitutive promoter. In another embodiment expression is regulated by an inducible promoter. In another embodiment expression is regulated by a tissue specific promoter.

In a specific embodiment a vector is used that comprises a promoter operably linked to a conjugate encoding nucleic acid or nucleic acid that encodes a portion of the conjugate one or more origins of replication and optionally one or more selectable markers e.g. an antibiotic resistance gene .

In mammalian host cells a number of viral based expression systems may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector polypeptide s of the conjugate may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription translation control complex e.g. the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted into the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion into a non essential region of the viral genome e.g. region E1 or E3 will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the antibody molecule and or proteinaceous cytotoxic moiety in infected hosts e.g. see Logan Shenk 1984 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81 355 359 . Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted fusion protein coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements transcription terminators etc. see Bittner et al. 1987 Methods in Enzymol. 153 51 544 .

Expression vectors containing inserts of a gene encoding a conjugate or a portion thereof can be identified by three general approaches a nucleic acid hybridization b presence or absence of marker gene functions and c expression of inserted sequences. In the first approach the presence of a gene encoding a conjugate or a portion thereof in an expression vector can be detected by nucleic acid hybridization using probes comprising sequences that are homologous to the inserted gene. In the second approach the recombinant vector host system can be identified and selected based upon the presence or absence of certain marker gene functions e.g. thymidine kinase activity resistance to antibiotics transformation phenotype occlusion body formation in baculovirus etc. caused by the insertion of a nucleotide sequence encoding a conjugate or a portion thereof into the vector. For example if the nucleotide sequence encoding a segment s of a conjugate is inserted within the marker gene sequence of the vector recombinants containing the gene encoding the conjugate insert can be identified by the absence of the marker gene function. In the third approach recombinant expression vectors can be identified by assaying the gene product e.g. conjugate expressed by the recombinant. Such assays can be based for example on the physical or functional properties of the conjugate in in vitro assay systems e.g. binding to IL3R killing IL3R expressing cells competing with other IL3R antibodies or with IL 3 for binding to IL3R etc.

In addition a host cell strain may be chosen that modulates the expression of the inserted sequences or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Expression from certain promoters can be elevated in the presence of certain inducers thus expression of the genetically engineered conjugates or components thereof may be modulated. Furthermore different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the translational and post translational processing and modification e.g. glycosylation phosphorylation of proteins. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the desired modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. For example expression in yeast will produce a glycosylated product and expression in a bacterial system will produce an unglycosylated product. Eukaryotic host cells that possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript glycosylation and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO VERY BHK HeLa COS MDCK 293 3T3 WI38 NS0. Furthermore different vector host expression systems may affect processing reactions to different extents.

For long term high yield production of recombinant conjugates stable expression is preferred. For example cell lines that stably express the conjugate or a portion thereof of the invention may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors that contain viral origins of replication host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements e.g. promoter enhancer sequences transcription terminators polyadenylation sites etc. and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1 2 days in an enriched medium and then are switched to a selective medium. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method may advantageously be used to engineer cell lines that express a conjugate of the invention. Such engineered cell lines may be particularly useful in screening and evaluating compounds that affect the activity of an immunotoxin conjugate binding to IL3R or cytotoxin action.

A number of selection systems may be used including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase Wigler et al. 1977 Cell 11 223 hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase Szybalska Szybalski 1962 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 48 2026 and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase Lowy et al. 1980 Cell 22 817 genes can be employed in tk hgprt or aprt cells respectively. Also antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for dhfr which confers resistance to methotrexate Wigler et al. 1980 Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77 3567 O Hare et al. 1981 Proc. Natl.

Once a conjugate or a portion thereof i.e. the antibody a chain of the antibody fused to a cytotoxin the cytotoxin etc. of the invention has been produced by recombinant expression or by chemical synthesis it may be purified by methods known in the art for purification and or refolding of proteins for example by chromatography e.g. ion exchange affinity particularly by affinity for the specific antibody for Protein A or the antibody for IL3R and sizing column chromatography centrifugation differential solubility or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. Expression in bacteria may result in the antibody cytotoxin conjugate being secreted into the periplasm. In such a case proteins are purified using standard chromatographic techniques for example a two step procedure that involves a Mono Q Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc. anion exchange column and TSK 250 gel filtration column chromatography.

Often expression in bacteria causes functional proteins such as the IL3R antibody conjugates of the invention to be localized in inclusion bodies. This requires that the proteins are solubilized using strong denaturants and subsequently refolded. In the solubilization step a reducing agent must be present to dissolve disulfide bonds as is well known in the art. An exemplary buffer with a reducing agent is 0.1 M Tris pH 8 6M guanidine 2 mM EDTA 0.3 M DTE dithioerythritol . Re oxidation of protein disulfide bonds can be effectively catalyzed in the present of low molecular weight thiol reagents in reduced and oxidized form. Renaturation is typically accomplished by rapid dilution e.g. 100 fold of the denatured and reduced protein into refolding buffer. An exemplary buffer is 0.1 M Tris pH 8.0 0.5M L arginine 8 mM oxidized glutathione and 2 mM EDTA. Another buffer is phosphate buffered saline. Other techniques known to those skilled in the art may be used. When the antibody moiety of the immunotoxin contains multiple chains e.g. dsFv fragments consisting of modified Vand V one of which is continuous with a proteinaceous cytotoxin such as PE each chain can be solubilized separately and then combined in the refolding solution. A preferred yield is obtained when these two proteins are mixed in a molar ratio such that a molar excess of one protein over the other does not exceed a 5 fold excess. It is desirable to add excess oxidized glutathione or other oxidizing low molecular weight compounds to the refolding solution after the redox shuffling is completed. Alternatively the final oxidation can be omitted and the refolding carried out at pH 9.5. Renatured material can then be purified using standard chromatography techniques for example a three step column chromatographic procedure involving Q Sepharose Mono Q and TSK 250 gel filtration can be used to obtain highly purified monomeric fusion proteins. See e.g. Seetharam et al. Increased Cytotoxic Activity of Exotoxin and Two Chimeric Toxins Ending in KDEL 266 17376 17381 1991 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 074 644 which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.

In a specific embodiment of the invention a scFv PE38 immunotoxin is constructed and purified. Total cellular RNA is isolated from hybridoma cells expressing the desired monoclonal antibodies using methods known to those skilled in the art for example using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit. Vand VcDNAs of the monoclonal antibodies can be obtained by a RACE method using SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit Clontech as described in Pastan I Beers R Bera T K. Recombinant immunotoxins in the treatment of cancer. Methods Mol Biol 2004 248 503 18 or other method for preparation of cDNA known to those of skill in the art. Prepared cDNAs are then used as the template for PCR reactions to amplify the desired Vand Vfragments. The PCR products can then be cloned into an appropriate vector either directly into a vector containing the cytotoxin or transferred to a shuttle vector such as pCR4 TOPO using the TOPO TA cloning kit Invitrogen . Clones for each chain should be sequenced to exclude the possibility of PCR error. The obtained sequences should be confirmed again by comparing sequences in e.g. a public database such as GenBank. The Vand Vchains can then be assembled into a single chain Fv scFv and fused to PE38 as described in Pastan I Beers R Bera T K. Recombinant immunotoxins in the treatment of cancer. Expression and purification of scFv PE38 is as described in Pastan I Beers R Bera T K. Recombinant immunotoxins in the treatment of cancer. Methods Mol Biol 2004 248 503 18 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

In another embodiment the PE cytotoxin can be modified so that its carboxyl terminus contains the KDEL sequence. For example a KDEL variant can be constructed by replacing the PE38 portion from the antibody cytotoxin conjugate expression plasmid with PE38 containing KDEL as described in Kreitman R J Margulies I Stetler Stevenson M et al. Cytotoxic activity of disulfide stabilized recombinant immunotoxin RFB4 dsFv PE38 BL22 toward fresh malignant cells from patients with B cell leukemias.

Antibodies that bind to an antigen can be produced by any method known in the art for the synthesis of antibodies in particular by chemical synthesis or preferably by recombinant expression techniques. In some embodiments an immunogen that comprises an epitope unique to a protein component is used to generate an antibody specific for the component.

Polyclonal antibodies specific for an antigen can be produced by various procedures well known in the art. As a non limiting example the antigen i.e. human IL3R can be administered to various host animals including but not limited to rabbits mice rats etc. to induce the production of sera containing polyclonal antibodies specific for the human antigen. Various adjuvants may be used to increase the immunological response depending on the host species and include but are not limited to Freund s complete and incomplete mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide surface active substances such as lysolecithin pluronic polyols polyanions peptides oil emulsions keyhole limpet hemocyanins dinitrophenol and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG bacille Calmette Guerin and . Such adjuvants are also well known in the art.

Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using a wide variety of techniques known in the art including the use of hybridoma recombinant and phage display technologies or a combination thereof. For example monoclonal antibodies can be produced using hybridoma techniques including those known in the art and taught for example in K hler Milstein 1975 Nature 256 495 497 Pasqualini Arap 2004 PNAS USA 101 257 259 Steinitz et al. 1977 Nature 269 420 422 Vollmers et al. 1989 Cancer Res. 49 2471 2476 Vollmers Brandlein 2002 Hum. Antibodies 11 4 131 142 Harlow et al. Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 2nd ed. 1988 Hammerling et al. in Monoclonal Antibodies and T Cell Hybridomas 563 681 Elsevier N.Y. 1981 said references incorporated by reference in their entireties . The term monoclonal antibody as used herein is not limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology. The term monoclonal antibody refers to an antibody that is derived from a single clone including any eukaryotic prokaryotic or phage clone and not the method by which it is produced.

Methods for producing and screening for specific antibodies using hybridoma technology are routine and well known in the art. Briefly mice can be immunized with a non murine antigen and once an immune response is detected e.g. antibodies specific for the antigen are detected in the mouse serum the mouse spleen is harvested and splenocytes isolated. The splenocytes are then fused by well known techniques to any suitable myeloma cells for example cells from cell line SP20 available from the ATCC. Hybridomas are selected and cloned by limited dilution. The hybridoma clones are then assayed by methods known in the art for cells that secrete antibodies capable of binding IL3R . Ascites fluid which generally contains high levels of antibodies can be generated by immunizing mice with positive hybridoma clones.

The present invention provides methods of generating monoclonal antibodies as well as antibodies produced by the method comprising culturing a hybridoma cell e.g. the hybridoma that expresses 26292 32703 32701 or 32716 monoclonal antibody secreting an antibody of the invention wherein preferably the hybridoma is generated by fusing splenocytes isolated from a mouse immunized with a non murine antigen with myeloma cells and then screening the hybridomas resulting from the fusion for hybridoma clones that secrete an antibody able to bind to the antigen.

Antibody fragments that recognize specific particular epitopes on IL3R may be generated by any technique known to those of skill in the art. For example total cellular RNA is isolated from hybridoma cells expressing the desired monoclonal antibodies using methods known to those skilled in the art e.g. using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit. Vand VcDNAs of the monoclonal antibodies can be obtained by a RACE method using SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit Clontech as described in Pastan I Beers R Bera T K. Recombinant immunotoxins in the treatment of cancer. Methods Mol Biol 2004 248 503 18 or other method for preparation of cDNA known to those of skill in the art. Prepared cDNAs are then used as the template for PCR reactions to amplify the desired Vand Vfragments. The PCR products can then be cloned into an appropriate vector either directly into a vector containing the cytotoxin or transferred to a shuttle vector such as pCR4 TOPO using the TOPO TA cloning kit Invitrogen . The Vand Vchains can then be assembled into a single chain Fv scFv and fused to a cytotoxin as described in Pastan I Beers R Bera T K. Recombinant immunotoxins in the treatment of cancer. 2004 248 503 18 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As another example Fab and F ab fragments of the invention may be produced by proteolytic cleavage of immunoglobulin molecules using enzymes such as papain to produce Fab fragments or pepsin to produce F ab fragments . F ab fragments contain the variable region the light chain constant region and the CHdomain of the heavy chain.

Further the antibodies of the present invention can also be generated using various phage display methods known in the art. In phage display methods functional antibody domains are displayed on the surface of phage particles that carry the polynucleotide sequences encoding them. In particular DNA sequences encoding Vand Vdomains are amplified from animal cDNA libraries e.g. human or murine cDNA libraries of IL3R expressing tissues . The DNA encoding the Vand Vdomains are recombined together with an scFv linker by PCR and cloned into a phagemid vector. The vector is electroporated in and the is infected with helper phage. Phage used in these methods are typically filamentous phage including fd and M13 and the Vand Vdomains are usually recombinantly fused to either the phage gene III or gene VIII. Phage expressing an antigen binding domain that binds to a particular antigen can be selected or identified with antigen e.g. using labeled antigen or antigen bound or captured to a solid surface or bead. Examples of phage display methods that can be used to make the antibodies of the present invention include those disclosed in Brinkman et al. 1995 J. Immunol. Methods 182 41 50 Ames et al. 1995 J. Immunol. Methods 184 177 186 Kettleborough et al. 1994 Eur. J.

As described in the above references after phage selection the antibody coding regions from the phage can be isolated and used to generate whole antibodies including human antibodies or any other desired antigen binding fragment and expressed in any desired host including mammalian cells insect cells plant cells yeast and bacteria e.g. as described below. Techniques to recombinantly produce Fab Fab and F ab fragments can also be employed using methods known in the art such as those disclosed in PCT publication No. WO 92 22324 Mullinax et al. 1992 BioTechniques 12 6 864 869 Sawai et al. 1995 AJRI 34 26 34 and Better et al. 1988 Science 240 1041 1043 said references incorporated by reference in their entireties .

To generate whole antibodies PCR primers including Vor Vnucleotide sequences a restriction site and a flanking sequence to protect the restriction site can be used to amplify the Vor Vsequences in scFv clones. Utilizing cloning techniques known to those of skill in the art the PCR amplified Vdomains can be cloned into vectors expressing a Vconstant region e.g. the human gamma 4 constant region and the PCR amplified Vdomains can be cloned into vectors expressing a Vconstant region e.g. human kappa or lambda constant regions. Preferably the vectors for expressing the Vor Vdomains comprise an EF 1 promoter a secretion signal a cloning site for the variable domain constant domains and a selection marker such as neomycin. The Vand Vdomains may also cloned into one vector expressing the necessary constant regions. The heavy chain conversion vectors and light chain conversion vectors are then co transfected into cell lines to generate stable or transient cell lines that express full length antibodies e.g. IgG using techniques known to those of skill in the art.

For some uses including in vivo use of antibodies in humans and in vitro detection assays it may be preferable to use humanized antibodies or chimeric antibodies. Completely human antibodies and humanized antibodies are particularly desirable for therapeutic treatment of human subjects. Human antibodies can be made by a variety of methods known in the art including phage display methods described above using antibody libraries derived from human immunoglobulin sequences. See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 444 887 and 4 716 111 and International publication Nos. WO 98 46645 WO 98 50433 WO 98 24893 WO98 16654 WO 96 34096 WO 96 33735 and WO 91 10741 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Human antibodies can also be produced using transgenic mice that are incapable of expressing functional endogenous immunoglobulins but that can express human immunoglobulin genes. For example the human heavy and light chain immunoglobulin gene complexes may be introduced randomly or by homologous recombination into mouse embryonic stem cells. Alternatively the human variable region constant region and diversity region may be introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells in addition to the human heavy and light chain genes. The mouse heavy and light chain immunoglobulin genes may be rendered non functional separately or simultaneously with the introduction of human immunoglobulin loci by homologous recombination. In particular homozygous deletion of the JH region prevents endogenous antibody production. The modified embryonic stem cells are expanded and microinjected into blastocysts to produce chimeric mice. The chimeric mice are then be bred to produce homozygous offspring which express human antibodies. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen e.g. all or a portion of a polypeptide of the invention. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained from the immunized transgenic mice using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus using such a technique it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG IgA IgM and IgE antibodies. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies see Lonberg and Huszar 1995 Int. Rev. Immunol. 13 65 93.

Freemont Calif. and Genpharm San Jose Calif. can be engaged to provide human antibodies directed against a selected antigen using technology similar to that described above.

A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different immunoglobulin molecules. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. See e.g. Morrison 1985 Science 229 1202 Oi et al. 1986 BioTechniques 4 214 Gillies et al. 1989 J. Immunol. Methods 125 191 202 and U.S. Pat.

A humanized antibody is an antibody that is capable of binding to a predetermined antigen and that comprises a framework region having substantially the amino acid sequence of a human immunoglobulin and a CDR having substantially the amino acid sequence of a non human immunoglobulin. A humanized antibody comprises substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains Fab Fab F ab Fabc Fv in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin i.e. donor antibody and all or substantially all of the framework regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. Preferably a humanized antibody also comprises at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin. Ordinarily the antibody will contain both the light chain as well as at least the variable domain of a heavy chain. The antibody also may include the CH1 hinge CH2 CH3 and CH4 regions of the heavy chain. The humanized antibody can be selected from any class of immunoglobulins including IgM IgG IgD IgA and IgE and any isotype including IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 and IgG4. Usually the constant domain is a complement fixing constant domain where it is desired that the humanized antibody exhibit cytotoxic activity and the class is typically IgG1. Where such cytotoxic activity is not desirable the constant domain may be of the IgG2 class. The humanized antibody may comprise sequences from more than one class or isotype and selecting particular constant domains to optimize desired effector functions is within the ordinary skill in the art. The framework and CDR regions of a humanized antibody need not correspond precisely to the parental sequences e.g. the donor CDR or the consensus framework may be mutagenized by substitution insertion or deletion of at least one residue so that the CDR or framework residue at that site does not correspond to either the consensus or the import antibody. Such mutations however will not be extensive. Usually at least 75 of the humanized antibody residues will correspond to those of the parental framework and CDR sequences more often 90 and most preferably greater than 95 .

Often framework residues in the framework regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter preferably improve antigen binding.

Biol. 291 1119 1128 Ohage et al. 1999 J. Mol. Biol. 291 1129 1134 and Wirtz and Steipe 1999 Protein Science 8 2245 2250 which references are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Recombinant molecular biological techniques such as those described for recombinant production of antibodies may also be used in the generation of intrabodies.

The invention provides nucleic acid sequences comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody or an antibody conjugate that binds to IL3R . In a specific embodiment such nucleic acid sequences are isolated. The invention also encompasses nucleic acid sequences that hybridize under high intermediate or lower stringency hybridization conditions e.g. as defined supra to nucleic acid sequences that encode an antibody of the invention.

The nucleic acid sequence may be obtained and the nucleotide sequence of the nucleic acid sequence determined by any method known in the art. The nucleotide sequence of antibodies specific for IL3R or a desired epitope on IL3R can be obtained e.g. from the literature or a database such as GenBank. Such a nucleic acid sequence encoding the antibody may be assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides e.g. as described in Kutmeier et al. 1994 BioTechniques 17 242 which briefly involves the synthesis of overlapping oligonucleotides containing portions of the sequence encoding the antibody annealing and ligating of those oligonucleotides and then amplification of the ligated oligonucleotides by PCR. and Table 1 provide the nucleotide and or amino acid sequences of the VH domains VL domains and CDRs of the 26929 32703 32701 and 32716 antibodies.

Alternatively a nucleic acid sequence encoding an IL3R antibody may be generated from nucleic acid from a suitable source. If a clone containing a nucleic acid encoding a particular antibody is not available but the sequence of the antibody molecule is known a nucleic acid encoding the immunoglobulin may be chemically synthesized or obtained from a suitable source e.g. an antibody cDNA library or a cDNA library generated from or nucleic acid preferably poly A RNA isolated from any tissue or cells expressing the antibody such as hybridoma cells selected to express an antibody of the invention by PCR amplification using synthetic primers hybridizable to the 3 and 5 ends of the sequence or by cloning using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the particular gene sequence to identify e.g. a cDNA clone from a cDNA library that encodes the antibody. Amplified nucleic acids generated by PCR may then be cloned into replicable cloning vectors using any method well known in the art.

Once the nucleotide sequence of the antibody is determined the nucleotide sequence of the antibody may be manipulated using methods well known in the art for the manipulation of nucleotide sequences e.g. recombinant DNA techniques site directed mutagenesis PCR etc. see for example the techniques described in Sambrook et al. 1990 Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual 2d Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. and Ausubel et al. eds. 1998 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons NY which are both incorporated by reference herein in their entireties to generate antibodies having a different amino acid sequence for example to create amino acid substitutions deletions and or insertions.

In a specific embodiment one or more of the CDRs is inserted within framework regions using routine recombinant DNA techniques. The framework regions may be naturally occurring or consensus framework regions and preferably human framework regions see e.g. Chothia et al. 1998 J. Mol. Biol. 278 457 479 for a listing of human framework regions . Preferably the nucleic acid sequence generated by the combination of the framework regions and CDRs encodes an antibody that binds to the IL3R chain. In a specific embodiment one or more amino acid substitutions may be made within the framework regions and in certain embodiments the amino acid substitutions improve binding of the antibody to its antigen. Additionally such methods may be used to make amino acid substitutions or deletions of one or more variable region cysteine residues participating in an intrachain disulfide bond to generate antibody molecules lacking one or more intrachain disulfide bonds. Other alterations to the nucleic acid sequence are encompassed by the present invention and within the skill of the art.

Recombinant expression of an antibody that binds to IL3R described above requires construction of an expression vector containing a nucleic acid sequence that encodes the antibody. Once a nucleic acid sequence encoding an antibody molecule heavy or light chain of an antibody or fragment thereof preferably but not necessarily containing the heavy or light chain variable domain of the invention has been obtained the vector for the production of the antibody molecule may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Thus methods for preparing an antibody by expressing a nucleic acid sequence encoding the antibody are described herein. Methods that are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include for example in vitro recombinant DNA techniques synthetic techniques and in vivo genetic recombination. The invention thus provides replicable vectors comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody molecule of the invention a heavy or light chain of an antibody a heavy or light chain variable domain of an antibody or a fragment thereof or a heavy or light chain CDR operably linked to a promoter. Such vectors may include the nucleotide sequence encoding the constant region of the antibody molecule see e.g. International Publication No. WO 86 05807 International Publication No. WO 89 01036 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 122 464 and the variable domain of the antibody may be cloned into such a vector for expression of the entire heavy chain the entire light chain or both the entire heavy and light chains.

The expression vector is transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce an antibody of the invention. Thus the invention includes host cells containing a nucleic acid sequence encoding an antibody or a heavy or light chain thereof or fragment thereof or a single chain antibody of the invention operably linked to a heterologous promoter. In preferred embodiments for the expression of double chained antibodies vectors encoding both the heavy and light chains may be co expressed in the host cell for expression of the entire immunoglobulin molecule as detailed below.

A variety of host expression vector systems may be utilized to express the antibody molecules of the invention see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 807 715 . Such host expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of interest may be produced and subsequently purified but also represent cells that may when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences express an antibody molecule of the invention in situ. These include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria e.g. and transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences yeast e.g. or transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors e.g. baculovirus containing antibody coding sequences plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors e.g. cauliflower mosaic virus CaMV tobacco mosaic virus TMV or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors e.g. Ti plasmid containing antibody coding sequences or mammalian cell systems e.g. COS CHO BHK 293 NS0 and 3T3 cells harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells e.g. metallothionein promoter or from mammalian viruses e.g. the adenovirus late promoter the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter . Preferably bacterial cells such as and more preferably eukaryotic cells especially for the expression of whole recombinant antibody molecules are used for the expression of a recombinant antibody molecule. For example mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells CHO in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for antibodies Foecking et al. 1986 Gene 45 101 and Cockett et al. 1990 Bio Technology 8 2 . In a specific embodiment the expression of nucleotide sequences encoding antibodies that bind to the IL3R alpha chain is regulated by a constitutive promoter inducible promoter or tissue specific promoter.

In bacterial systems a number of expression vectors may be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the antibody molecule being expressed. For example when a large quantity of such an antibody is to be produced for the generation of pharmaceutical compositions of an antibody molecule vectors that direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified may be desirable. Such vectors include but are not limited to the expression vector pUR278 Ruther et al. 1983 EMBO 12 1791 in which the antibody coding sequence may be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a fusion protein is produced pIN vectors Inouye Inouye 1985 Nucleic Acids Res. 13 3101 3109 Van Heeke Schuster 1989 J. Biol. Chem. 24 5503 5509 and the like. pGEX vectors may also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione S transferase GST . In general such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to matrix glutathione agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.

In an insect system nuclear polyhedrosis virus AcNPV is used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in cells. The antibody coding sequence may be cloned individually into non essential regions for example the polyhedrin gene of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter for example the polyhedrin promoter .

In mammalian host cells a number of virus based expression systems may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector the antibody coding sequence of interest may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription translation control complex e.g. the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted into the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non essential region of the viral genome e.g. region E1 or E3 will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the antibody molecule in infected hosts e.g. see Logan Shenk 1984 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 8 1 355 359 . Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements transcription terminators etc. see e.g. Bittner et al. 1987 Methods in Enzymol. 153 51 544 .

In addition a host cell strain may be chosen that modulates the expression of the inserted sequences or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications e.g. glycosylation and processing e.g. cleavage of protein products may be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end eukaryotic host cells that possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript glycosylation and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO VERY BHK HeLa COS MDCK 293 3T3 W138 BT483 Hs578T HTB2 BT2O and T47D NS0 a murine myeloma cell line that does not endogenously produce any immunoglobulin chains CRL7O3O and HsS78Bst cells.

For long term high yield production of recombinant proteins stable expression is preferred. For example cell lines that stably express the antibody molecule may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors that contain viral origins of replication host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements e.g. promoter enhancer sequences transcription terminators polyadenylation sites etc. and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1 2 days in an enriched media and then are switched to selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method may advantageously be used to engineer cell lines that express the antibody molecule. Such engineered cell lines may be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compositions that interact directly or indirectly with the antibody molecule.

A number of selection systems may be used as non limiting examples the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase Wigler et al. 1977 Cell 11 223 hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase Szybalska Szybalski 1992 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 48 202 and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase Lowy et al. 1980 Cell 22 8 17 genes can be employed in tk hgprt or aprt cells respectively. Also antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes dhfr which confers resistance to methotrexate Wigler et al. 1980 Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77 357 O Hare et al. 1981 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78 1527 gpt which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid Mulligan Berg 1981 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78 2072 neo which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G 418 Wu and Wu 1991 Biotherapy 3 87 95 Tolstoshev 1993 Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 32 573 596 Mulligan 1993 Science 260 926 932 and Morgan and Anderson 1993 Ann. Rev. Biochem. 62 191 217 May 1993 TIB TECH 11 5 155 2 15 and hygro which confers resistance to hygromycin Santerre et al. 1984 Gene 30 147 . Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology may be routinely applied to select the desired recombinant clone and such methods are described for example in Ausubel et al. eds. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons NY 1993 Kriegler Gene Transfer and Expression A Laboratory Manual Stockton Press NY 1990 and in Chapters 12 and 13 Dracopoli et al. eds. Current Protocols in Human Genetics John Wiley Sons NY 1994 Colberre Garapin et al. 1981 J. Mol. Biol. 150 1 which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.

The expression levels of an antibody molecule can be increased by vector amplification for a review see Bebbington and Hentschel The use of vectors based on gene amplification for the expression of cloned genes in mammalian cells in DNA cloning Vol. 3. Academic Press New York 1987 . When a marker in the vector system expressing antibody is amplifiable increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the antibody gene production of the antibody will also increase Crouse et al. 1983 Mol. Cell. Biol. 3 257 .

The host cell may be co transfected with two expression vectors of the invention the first vector encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding a light chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors may contain identical selectable markers which enable equal expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides. Alternatively a single vector may be used which encodes and is capable of expressing both heavy and light chain polypeptides. In such situations the light chain should be placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain Proudfoot 1986 Nature 322 52 and Kohler 1980 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77 2 197 . The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains may comprise cDNA or genomic DNA.

Once an antibody molecule of the invention has been produced by recombinant expression it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of an immunoglobulin molecule for example by chromatography e.g. ion exchange affinity particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A and sizing column chromatography centrifugation differential solubility or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. Further the antibodies may be fused to heterologous polypeptide sequences described herein or otherwise known in the art to facilitate purification.

Once a conjugate of the invention has been produced by recombinant expression or by chemical synthesis it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of a protein for example by chromatography e.g. ion exchange affinity particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A and sizing column chromatography centrifugation differential solubility or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins.

While not being bound by any specific theory Applicants believe that by the administration of the prophylactically and or therapeutically effective regimens the cancer stem cell population of a cancer tumor is stabilized or reduced so as to limit or prevent the potential repopulation of the tumor.

In certain embodiments of these aspects the regimens comprise administering a prophylactically effective regimen and or a therapeutically effective regimen wherein the regimen results in a reduction in the cancer stem cell population in the patient. In one embodiment the patient undergoing the regimen is monitored to determine whether the regimen has resulted in a reduction in the cancer stem cell population in the patient.

Typically the monitoring of the amount of cancer stem cells is conducted by detecting the amount of cancer stem cells in a specimen extracted from the patient. Methods of detecting the amount of cancer stem cells in a specimen are described infra in Section 5.9. This monitoring step is typically performed at least 1 2 4 6 7 8 10 12 14 15 16 18 20 or 30 60 90 120 days 6 months 9 months 12 months or 12 months after the patient begins receiving the regimen.

In some embodiments the specimen may be a blood specimen wherein the amount of cancer stem cells per unit of volume e.g. 1 ml or other measured unit e.g. per unit field in the case of a histological analysis is quantitated. In certain embodiments the amount of cancer stem cells is determined as a portion e.g. a percentage of the cancer cells present in the blood specimen as a subset of the cancer cells present in the blood specimen or as a subset of a subset of the cancer cells present in the blood specimen. The amount of cancer stem cells in other embodiments can be determined as a percentage of the total blood cells.

In other embodiments the specimen extracted from the patient is a tissue specimen e.g. a biopsy extracted from suspected cancerous tissue where the amount of cancer stem cells can be measured for example on the basis of the amount of cancer stem cells per unit weight of the tissue. In certain embodiments the amount of cancer stem cells is determined as a portion e.g. a percentage of the cancer cells present in the tissue as a subset of the cancer cells present in the tissue or as a subset of a subset of the cancer cells present in the tissue.

The amount of cancer stem cells in the extracted specimen can be compared with the amount of cancer stem cells measured in reference samples to assess the efficacy of the regimen and the amelioration of the cancer under therapy. In one embodiment the reference sample is a specimen extracted from the patient undergoing therapy wherein the specimen is extracted from the patient at an earlier time point e.g. prior to receiving the regimen as a baseline reference sample or at an earlier time point while receiving the therapy . In another embodiment the reference sample is extracted from a healthy noncancer afflicted patient.

In other embodiments the amount of cancer stem cells in the extracted specimen can be compared with a predetermined reference range. In a specific embodiment the predetermined reference range is based on i the amount of cancer stem cells obtained from a population s of patients suffering from the same type of cancer as the patient undergoing the therapy or ii the amount of stem cells obtained from a population s of patients without cancer.

If the reduction in the amount of cancer stem cells is determined to be too small upon comparing the amount of cancer stem cells in the specimen extracted from the patient undergoing the regimen with the reference specimen then the medical practitioner has a number of options to adjust the regimen. For instance the medical practitioner can then increase either the dosage of the compound or composition of the invention administered the frequency of the administration the duration of administration or any combination thereof. In a specific embodiment after the determination is made a second effective amount of a compound or composition of the invention can be administered to the patient.

In certain embodiments if the reduction in the amount of cancer stem cells is determined to be acceptable upon comparing the amount of cancer stem cells in the sample obtained from the patient undergoing the therapeutic or prophylactic regimen with the reference sample then the medical practitioner may elect not to adjust the regimen. For instance the medical practitioner may elect not to increase either the dosage of the compound or composition of the invention being administered the frequency of the administration the duration of administration or any combination thereof. Further the medical practitioner may elect to add additional therapies or combine therapies.

In other embodiments the regimens comprise administering a prophylactically effective regimen and or a therapeutically effective regimen wherein the regimen results in a reduction in the amount of cancer cells in the patient. In one embodiment the patient undergoing the regimen is monitored to determine whether the regimen has resulted in a reduction in the amount of cancer cells in the patient.

Typically the monitoring of the amount of cancer cells is conducted by detecting the amount of cancer cells in a specimen extracted from the patient. Methods of detecting the amount of cancer cells in a specimen are described infra in Section 5.10. This monitoring step is typically performed at least 1 2 4 6 7 8 10 12 14 15 16 18 20 or 30 60 90 120 days 6 months 9 months 12 months or 12 months after the patient begins receiving the regimen.

In some embodiments the specimen may be a blood specimen wherein the amount of cancer cells per unit of volume e.g. 1 ml or other measured unit e.g. per unit field in the case of a histological analysis is quantitated. The cancer cell population in certain embodiments can be determined as a percentage of the total blood cells.

In some embodiments the sample obtained from the patient may be a bone marrow specimen wherein the amount of cancer cells per unit of volume e.g. 1 ml or other measured unit e.g. per unit field in the case of a histological analysis is quantitated. The cancer cell population in certain embodiments can be determined as a percentage of the total bone marrow cells.

In other embodiments the specimen extracted from the patient is a tissue specimen e.g. a biopsy extracted from suspected cancerous tissue where the amount of cancer cells can be measured for example on the basis of the amount of cancer cells per unit weight of the tissue. The amount of cancer cells can also be measured using immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry.

The amount of cancer cells in the extracted specimen can be compared with the amount of cancer cells measured in reference samples to assess the efficacy of the regimen and amelioration of the cancer under therapy. In one embodiment the reference sample is a specimen extracted from the patient undergoing therapy wherein the specimen from the patient is extracted at an earlier time point e.g. prior to receiving the regimen as a baseline reference sample or at an earlier time point while receiving the therapy . In another embodiment the reference sample is extracted from a healthy noncancer afflicted patient.

In other embodiments the cancer cell population in the extracted specimen can be compared with a predetermined reference range. In a specific embodiment the predetermined reference range is based on the amount of cancer cells obtained from a population s of patients suffering from the same type of cancer as the patient undergoing the therapy.

If the reduction in the cancer cell population is judged too small upon comparing the amount of cancer cells in the specimen extracted from the patients undergoing therapy with the reference specimen then the medical practitioner has a number of options to adjust the therapeutic regimen. For instance the medical practitioner can then either increase the dosage of the compound or composition of the invention administered the frequency of the administration the duration of administration or any combination thereof. In a specific embodiment after the determination is made a second effective amount of a compound or composition of the invention can be administered to the patient.

If the reduction in the cancer cell population is judged to be adequate upon comparing the amount of cancer cells in the specimen extracted from the patients undergoing therapy with the reference specimen then the medical practitioner may elect not to adjust the therapeutic regimen. For instance the medical practitioner may elect not to increase the dosage of the compound or composition of the invention administered the frequency of the administration the duration of administration or any combination thereof.

The above monitoring methods can also be used to monitor the amount of IL 3 receptor alpha subunit expressing cells where the disease or disorder is not a cancer i.e. in allergic disease or autoimmune disease.

In embodiments the medical practitioner may elect to measure the cancer population using in vivo imaging techniques. For example a ligand for a tumor marker can be conjugated to a radioisotope photon emitting compound or other signal emitting compound and then the ligand can be injected into the patient. The cancer cells can then be quantitated by measuring the signal generated when the ligand binds to the cancer cells in vivo.

In autoimmune disorders the immune system triggers an immune response and the body s normally protective immune system causes damage to its own tissues by mistakenly attacking self. There are many different autoimmune disorders which affect the body in different ways. For example the brain is affected in individuals with multiple sclerosis the gut is affected in individuals with Crohn s disease and the synovium bone and cartilage of various joints are affected in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. As autoimmune disorders progress destruction of one or more types of body tissues abnormal growth of an organ or changes in organ function may result. The autoimmune disorder may affect only one organ or tissue type or may affect multiple organs and tissues. Organs and tissues commonly affected by autoimmune disorders include red blood cells blood vessels connective tissues endocrine glands e.g. the thyroid or pancreas muscles joints and skin.

Examples of autoimmune disorders that can be prevented treated managed and or ameliorated by the methods of the invention include but are not limited to adrenergic drug resistance alopecia areata ankylosing spondylitis antiphospholipid syndrome autoimmune Addison s disease autoimmune diseases of the adrenal gland allergic encephalomyelitis autoimmune hemolytic anemia autoimmune hepatitis autoimmune inflammatory eye disease autoimmune neonatal thrombocytopenia autoimmune neutropenia autoimmune oophoritis and orchitis autoimmune thrombocytopenia autoimmune thyroiditis Behcet s disease bullous pemphigoid cardiomyopathy cardiotomy syndrome celiac sprue dermatitis chronic active hepatitis chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome CFIDS chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy Churg Strauss syndrome cicatrical pemphigoid CREST syndrome cold agglutinin disease Crohn s disease dense deposit disease discoid lupus essential mixed cryoglobulinemia fibromyalgia fibromyositis glomerulonephritis e.g. IgA nephrophathy gluten sensitive enteropathy Goodpasture s syndrome Graves disease Guillain Barre hyperthyroidism i.e. Hashimoto s thyroiditis idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis idiopathic Addison s disease idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura ITP IgA neuropathy juvenile arthritis lichen planus lupus erythematosus M ni re s disease mixed connective tissue disease multiple sclerosis Myasthenia Gravis myocarditis type 1 or immune mediated diabetes mellitus neuritis other endocrine gland failure pemphigus vulgaris pernicious anemia polyarteritis nodosa polychrondritis Polyendocrinopathies polyglandular syndromes polymyalgia rheumatica polymyositis and dermatomyositis post MI primary agammaglobulinemia primary biliary cirrhosis psoriasis psoriatic arthritis Raynauld s phenomenon relapsing polychondritis Reiter s syndrome rheumatic heart disease rheumatoid arthritis sarcoidosis scleroderma Sj gren s syndrome stiff man syndrome systemic lupus erythematosus takayasu arteritis temporal arteritis giant cell arteritis ulcerative colitis urticaria uveitis Uveitis Opthalmia vasculitides such as dermatitis herpetiformis vasculitis vitiligo and Wegener s granulomatosis.

In certain embodiments the invention provides a method of preventing treating managing and or ameliorating one or more allergic diseases or allergies or one or more symptoms thereof wherein the cells involved in such diseases or allergies express the interleukin 3 receptor beta subunit said method comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a dose of an effective amount of one or more pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Immune mediated allergic hypersensitivity reactions are classified into four types I IV according to the underlying mechanisms leading to the manifestation of the allergic symptoms. Type I allergic reactions are immediate hypersensitivity reactions characterized by IgE mediated release of vasoactive substances such as histamine from mast cells and basophils. Over hours the mast cells and basophils release proinflammatory cytokines producing vasodilation increased capillary permeability glandular hypersecretion smooth muscle spasm and tissue infiltration with eosinophils and other inflammatory cells.

Type II allergic reactions are cytotoxic hypersensitivity reactions and involve IgG or IgM antibodies bound to cell surface antigens with subsequent complement fixation. Certain cytotoxic cells such as killer T cells or macrophages are activated bind to cells coated with IgG and destroy the target cells. Type II reactions may result in cytolysis or tissue damage.

Type III reactions are immune complex reactions resulting from deposits of circulating antigen antibody immune complexes in blood vessels or tissues. Acute inflammation results from the immune complex initiating a sequence of events that results in polymorphonuclear cell migration and release of lysosomal proteolytic enzymes and permeability factors in tissues.

Type IV reactions are delayed hypersensitivity reactions caused by sensitized T lymphocytes after contact with a specific antigen. Activated sensitized T lymphocytes cause immunologic injury by direct toxic effect or through release of lymphokines and other soluble substances. The activated T lymphocytes may also release cytokines that affect the activity of macrophages neutrophils and lymphoid killer cells.

Allergic reactions can be immediate late phase or chronic. Continuous or chronic exposure to an allergen can result in chronic allergic inflammation. Tissues of sites of chronic inflammation contain eosinophils and T cells that release mediators that can cause tissue damage increased inflammation and increased sensitivity.

Currently allergic reactions are treated with drugs such as antihistamines corticosteroids vasodilators bronchodilators leukotriene inhibitors and immunomodulators which attempt to alleviate the symptoms associated with the allergic reaction.

In some embodiments the amount of cancer stem cells in a subject is determined using a technique well known to one of skill in the art.

In accordance with the invention cancer stem cells comprise a unique subpopulation often 0.1 10 or so of a tumor that in contrast to the remaining 90 or so of the tumor i.e. the tumor bulk are relatively more tumorigenic and relatively more slow growing or quiescent. Given that conventional therapies and regimens have in large part been designed to attack rapidly proliferating cells i.e. those cancer cells that comprise the tumor bulk slower growing cancer stem cells may be relatively more resistant than faster growing tumor bulk to conventional therapies and regimens. This would explain another reason for the failure of standard oncology treatment regimens to ensure long term benefit in most patients with advanced stage cancers. In a specific embodiment a cancer stem cell s is the founder cell of a tumor i.e. it is the progenitor of cancer cells . In some embodiments a cancer stem cell s has one two three or more or all of the following characteristics or properties i can harbor the ability to initiate a tumor and or to perpetuate tumor growth ii can be generally relatively less mutated than the bulk of a tumor e.g. due to slower growth and thus fewer DNA replication dependent errors improved DNA repair and or epigenetic non mutagenic changes contributing to their malignancy iii can have many features of a normal stem cell s e.g. similar cell surface antigen and or intracellular expression profile self renewal programs multi drug resistance an immature phenotype etc. characteristic of normal stem cells and may be derived from a normal stem cell s iv can be potentially responsive to its microenvironment e.g. the cancer stem cells may be capable of being induced to differentiate and or divide asymmetrically v can be the source of metastases vi can be slow growing or quiescent vii can be symmetrically dividing viii can be tumorigenic e.g. as determined by NOD SCID implantation experiments ix can be relatively resistant to traditional therapies i.e. chemoresistant and x can comprise a subpopulation of a tumor e.g. relative to the tumor bulk .

In other embodiments the amount of cancer stem cells in a sample from a subject is determined assessed using a technique described herein or well known to one of skill in the art. Such samples include but are not limited to biological samples and samples derived from a biological sample. In certain embodiments in addition to the biological sample itself or in addition to material derived from the biological sample such as cells the sample used in the methods of this invention comprises added water salts glycerin glucose an antimicrobial agent paraffin a chemical stabilizing agent heparin an anticoagulant or a buffering agent. In certain embodiments the biological sample is blood serum urine bone marrow or interstitial fluid. In another embodiment the sample is a tissue sample. In a particular embodiment the tissue sample is breast brain skin colon lung liver ovarian pancreatic prostate renal bone or skin tissue. In a specific embodiment the tissue sample is a biopsy of normal or tumor tissue. The amount of biological sample taken from the subject will vary according to the type of biological sample and the method of detection to be employed. In a particular embodiment the biological sample is blood serum urine or bone marrow and the amount of blood serum urine or bone marrow taken from the subject is 0.1 ml 0.5 ml 1 ml 5 ml 8 ml 10 ml or more. In another embodiment the biological sample is a tissue and the amount of tissue taken from the subject is less than 10 milligrams less than 25 milligrams less than 50 milligrams less than 1 gram less than 5 grams less than 10 grams less than 50 grams or less than 100 grams.

In accordance with the methods of the invention a sample derived from a biological sample is one in which the biological sample has been subjected to one or more pretreatment steps prior to the detection and or measurement of the cancer stem cell population in the sample. In certain embodiments a biological fluid is pretreated by centrifugation filtration precipitation dialysis or chromatography or by a combination of such pretreatment steps. In other embodiments a tissue sample is pretreated by freezing chemical fixation paraffin embedding dehydration permeablization or homogenization followed by centrifugation filtration precipitation dialysis or chromatography or by a combination of such pretreatment steps. In certain embodiments the sample is pretreated by removing cells other than stem cells or cancer stem cells from the sample or removing debris from the sample prior to the determination of the amount of cancer stem cells in the sample according to the methods of the invention.

The samples for use in the methods of this invention may be taken from any animal subject preferably mammal most preferably a human. The subject from which a sample is obtained and utilized in accordance with the methods of this invention includes without limitation an asymptomatic subject a subject manifesting or exhibiting 1 2 3 4 or more symptoms of cancer a subject clinically diagnosed as having cancer a subject predisposed to cancer a subject suspected of having cancer a subject undergoing therapy for cancer a subject that has been medically determined to be free of cancer e.g. following therapy for the cancer a subject that is managing cancer or a subject that has not been diagnosed with cancer. In certain embodiments the term has no detectable cancer as used herein refers to a subject or subjects in which there is no detectable cancer by conventional methods e.g. MRI. In other embodiments the term refers to a subject or subjects free from any disorder.

In certain embodiments the amount of cancer stem cells in a subject or a sample from a subject assessed prior to therapy or regimen e.g. at baseline or at least 1 2 4 6 7 8 10 12 14 15 16 18 20 30 60 90 days 6 months 9 months 12 months 12 months after the subject begins receiving the therapy or regimen. In certain embodiments the amount of cancer stem cells is assessed after a certain number of doses e.g. after 2 5 10 20 30 or more doses of a therapy . In other embodiments the amount of cancer stem cells is assessed after 1 week 2 weeks 1 month 2 months 1 year 2 years 3 years 4 years or more after receiving one or more therapies.

In certain embodiments a positive or negative control sample is a sample that is obtained or derived from a corresponding tissue or biological fluid or tumor as the sample to be analyzed in accordance with the methods of the invention. This sample may come from the same patient or different persons and at the same or different time points.

For clarity of disclosure and not by way of limitation the following pertains to analysis of a blood sample from a patient. However as one skilled in the art will appreciate the assays and techniques described herein can be applied to other types of patient samples including a body fluid e.g. blood bone marrow plasma urine bile ascitic fluid a tissue sample suspected of containing material derived from a cancer e.g. a biopsy or homogenate thereof. The amount of sample to be collected will vary with the particular type of sample and method of determining the amount of cancer stem cells used and will be an amount sufficient to detect the cancer stem cells in the sample.

A sample of blood may be obtained from a patient having different developmental or disease stages. Blood may be drawn from a subject from any part of the body e.g. a finger a hand a wrist an arm a leg a foot an ankle a stomach and a neck using techniques known to one of skill in the art in particular methods of phlebotomy known in the art. In a specific embodiment venous blood is obtained from a subject and utilized in accordance with the methods of the invention. In another embodiment arterial blood is obtained and utilized in accordance with the methods of the invention. The composition of venous blood varies according to the metabolic needs of the area of the body it is servicing. In contrast the composition of arterial blood is consistent throughout the body. For routine blood tests venous blood is generally used.

The amount of blood collected will vary depending upon the site of collection the amount required for a method of the invention and the comfort of the subject. In some embodiments any amount of blood is collected that is sufficient to detect the amount of cancer stem cells. In a specific embodiment 1 cc or more of blood is collected from a subject.

The amount of cancer stem cells in a sample can be expressed as the percentage of e.g. overall cells overall cancer cells or overall stem cells in the sample or quantitated relative to area e.g. cells per high power field or volume e.g. cells per ml or architecture e.g. cells per bone spicule in a bone marrow specimen .

In some embodiments the sample may be a blood sample bone marrow sample or a tissue tumor biopsy sample wherein the amount of cancer stem cells per unit of volume e.g. 1 mL or other measured unit e.g. per unit field in the case of a histological analysis is quantitated. In certain embodiments the cancer stem cell population is determined as a portion e.g. a percentage of the cancerous cells present in the blood or bone marrow or tissue tumor biopsy sample or as a subset of the cancerous cells present in the blood or bone marrow or tissue tumor biopsy sample. The cancer stem cell population in other embodiments can be determined as a portion e.g. percentage of the total cells. In yet other embodiments the cancer stem cell population is determined as a portion e.g. a percentage of the total stem cells present in the blood sample.

In other embodiments the sample from the patient is a tissue sample e.g. a biopsy from a subject with or suspected of having cancerous tissue where the amount of cancer stem cells can be measured for example by immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry or on the basis of the amount of cancer stem cells per unit area volume or weight of the tissue. In certain embodiments the cancer stem cell population the amount of cancer stem cells is determined as a portion e.g. a percentage of the cancerous cells present in the tissue sample or as a subset of the cancerous cells present in the tissue sample. In yet other embodiments the cancerous stem cell population the amount of cancer stem cells is determined as a portion e.g. a percentage of the overall cells or stem cell cells in the tissue sample.

The amount of cancer stem cells in a test sample can be compared with the amount of cancer stem cells in reference sample s to assess the efficacy of the regimen. In one embodiment the reference sample is a sample obtained from the subject undergoing therapy at an earlier time point e.g. prior to receiving the regimen as a baseline reference sample or at an earlier time point while receiving the therapy . In this embodiment the therapy desirably results in a decrease in the amount of cancer stem cells in the test sample as compared with the reference sample. In another embodiment the reference sample is obtained from a healthy subject who has no detectable cancer or from a patient that is in remission for the same type of cancer. In this embodiment the therapy desirably results in the test sample having an equal amount of cancer stem cells or less than the amount of cancer stem cells than are detected in the reference sample.

In other embodiments the cancer stem cell population in a test sample can be compared with a predetermined reference range and or a previously detected amount of cancer stem cells determined for the subject to gauge the subject s response to the regimens described herein. In a specific embodiment a stabilization or reduction in the amount of cancer stem cells relative to a predetermined reference range and or earlier previously detected cancer stem cell amount determined for the subject indicates an improvement in the subject s prognosis or a positive response to the regimen whereas an increase relative to the predetermined reference range and or earlier cancer stem cell amount indicates the same or worse prognosis and or a failure to respond to the regimen. The cancer stem cell amount can be used in conjunction with other measures to assess the prognosis of the subject and or the efficacy of the regimen. In a specific embodiment the predetermined reference range is based on the amount of cancer stem cells obtained from a patient or population s of patients suffering from the same type of cancer as the patient undergoing the therapy.

Generally since stem cell antigens can be present on both cancer stem cells and normal stem cells a sample from the cancer afflicted patient will have a higher stem cell count than a sample from a healthy subject who has no detectable cancer due to the presence of the cancer stem cells. The therapy will desirably result in a cancer stem cell count for the test sample e.g. the sample from the patient undergoing therapy that decreases and becomes increasingly closer to the stem cell count in a reference sample that is sample from a healthy subject who has no detectable cancer.

If the reduction in the amount of cancer stem cells is determined to be inadequate upon comparing the amount of cancer stem cells in the sample from the subject undergoing the regimen with the reference sample then the medical practitioner has a number of possible options to adjust the regimen. For instance the medical practitioner can then increase either the dosage or intensity of the therapy administered the frequency of the administration the duration of administration combine the therapy with another therapy ies change the management altogether including halting therapy or any combination thereof.

In certain embodiments the dosage frequency and or duration of administration of a therapy is modified as a result of the change in the amount of cancer stem cells detected in or from the treated patient. For example if a subject receiving therapy for leukemia has a cancer stem cell measurement of 2.5 of his tumor prior to therapy and 5 after 6 weeks of therapy then the therapy or regimen may be altered or stopped because the increase in the percentage of cancer stem cells indicates that the therapy or regimen is not optimal. Alternatively if another subject with leukemia has a cancer stem cell measurement of 2.5 of his tumor prior to therapy and 1 after 6 weeks of therapy then the therapy or regimen may be continued because the decrease in the percentage of cancer stem cells indicates that the therapy or regimen is effective.

The amount of cancer stem cells can be monitored assessed using standard techniques known to one of skill in the art. Cancer stem cells can be monitored by e.g. obtaining a sample such as a tissue tumor sample blood sample or a bone marrow sample from a subject and detecting cancer stem cells in the sample. The amount of cancer stem cells in a sample which may be expressed as percentages of e.g. overall cells or overall cancer cells can be assessed by detecting the expression of antigens on cancer stem cells. Techniques known to those skilled in the art can be used for measuring these activities. Antigen expression can be assayed for example by immunoassays including but not limited to western blots immunohistochemistry radioimmunoassays ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay sandwich immunoassays immunoprecipitation assays precipitin reactions gel diffusion precipitin reactions immunodiffusion assays agglutination assays complement fixation assays immunoradiometric assays fluorescent immunoassays immunofluorescence protein A immunoassays flow cytometry and FACS analysis. In such circumstances the amount of cancer stem cells in a test sample from a subject may be determined by comparing the results to the amount of stem cells in a reference sample e.g. a sample from a subject who has no detectable cancer or to a predetermined reference range or to the patient him herself at an earlier time point e.g. prior to or during therapy .

In a specific embodiment the cancer stem cell population in a sample from a patient is determined by flow cytometry. This method exploits the differential expression of certain surface markers on cancer stem cells relative to the bulk of the tumor. Labeled antibodies e.g. fluorescent antibodies can be used to react with the cells in the sample and the cells are subsequently sorted by FACS or flow cytometry methods. In some embodiments a combination of cell surface markers are utilized in order to determine the amount of cancer stem cells in the sample. For example both positive and negative cell sorting may be used to assess the amount of cancer stem cells in the sample. Cancer stem cells for specific tumor types can be determined by assessing the expression of markers on cancer stem cells. In certain embodiments the tumors harbor cancer stem cells and their associated markers as set forth in Table 2 below which provides a non limiting list of cancer stem cell phenotypes associated with various types of cancer.

Additional cancer stem cell markers include but are not limited to CD123 CLL 1 combinations of SLAMs signaling lymphocyte activation molecule family receptors see Yilmaz et al. Hematopoiesis 107 924 930 2006 such as CD150 CD244 and CD48 and those markers disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 004 528 to Bergstein in pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09 468 286 and in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2006 0083682 2007 0036800 2007 0036801 2007 0036802 2007 0041984 2007 0036803 and 2007 0036804 each of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. See e.g. Table 1 of U.S. Pat. No. 6 004 528 and Tables 1 2 and 3 of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09 468 286 and U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2006 0083682 2007 0036800 2007 0036801 2007 0036802 2007 0041984 2007 0036803 and 2007 0036804.

In a specific embodiment the cancer stem population in a sample e.g. a tissue sample such as a solid tumor biopsy is determined using immunohistochemistry techniques. This method exploits the differential expression of certain surface markers on cancer stem cells relative to the bulk of the tumor. Labeled antibodies e.g. fluorescent antibodies can be used to react with the cells in the sample and the tissue is subsequently stained. In some embodiments a combination of certain cell surface markers are utilized in order to determine the amount of cancer stem cells in the sample. Cancer stem cells for specific tumor types can be determined by assessing the expression of certain markers that are specific to cancer stem cells. In certain embodiments the tumors harbor cancer stem cells and their associated markers as set forth in Table 2 above.

Suitable cancer stem cell antigens may be identified i through publicly available information such as published and unpublished expression profiles including cell surface antigens of cancer stem cells of a particular tumor type or adult stem cells for a particular tissue type e.g. Table 2 and or ii by cloning cancer stem cells or adult stem cells of a particular tumor or tissue type respectively in order to determine their expression profiles and complement of cell surface antigens. Cloning of normal stem cells is a technique routinely employed in the art Uchida et al. Curr Opin Immunol 5 177 184 1993 . In fact this same technique is used to identify normal stem cells and cancer stem cells. Moreover assumption that a proportion of normal stem cell gene products e.g. cell surface antigens will also be present on cancer stem cells derived from the same tissue type has proven an effective way to identify cancer stem cell gene products and cancer stem cells. For example knowledge that the normal hematopoietic stem cell was CD34 CD38 resulted in the determination that acute myeloid leukemia AML stem cells is similarly CD34 CD38 . This indeed was confirmed by standard stem cell cloning techniques See Bonnet et al. Nat Med 3 730 737 1997 . Brain cancer stem cells were similarly isolated using a marker of normal brain stem cells in this case CD133 See Singh et al. Nature 432 7015 396 401 2004 .

In certain embodiments using flow cytometry of a sample the Hoechst dye protocol can be used to identify cancer stem cells in tumors. Briefly two Hoechst dyes of different colors typically red and blue are incubated with tumor cells. The cancer stem cells in comparison with bulk cancer cells over express dye efflux pumps on their surface that allow these cells to pump the dye back out of the cell. Bulk tumor cells largely have fewer of these pumps and are therefore relatively positive for the dye which can be detected by flow cytometry. Typically a gradient of dye positive dye vs. dye negative dye cells emerges when the entire population of cells is observed. Cancer stem cells are contained in the dye or dye low dye population. For an example of the use of the Hoechst dye protocol to characterize a stem cell or cancer stem cell population see Goodell et al. Blood 98 4 1166 1173 2001 and Kondo et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 101 781 786 2004 . In this way flow cytometry could be used to measure cancer stem cell amount pre and post therapy to assess the change in cancer stem cell amount arising from a given therapy or regimen.

In other embodiments using flow cytometry of a sample the cells in the sample may be treated with a substrate for aldehyde dehydrogenase that becomes fluorescent when catalyzed by this enzyme. For instance the sample can be treated with BODIPY aminoacetaldehyde which is commercially available from StemCell Technologies Inc. as Aldefluor . Cancer stem cells express high levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase relative to bulk cancer cells and therefore become brightly fluorescent upon reaction with the substrate. The cancer stem cells which become fluorescent in this type of experiment can then be detected and counted using a standard flow cytometer. In this way flow cytometry could be used to measure cancer stem cell amount pre and post therapy to assess the change in cancer stem cell amount arising from a given therapy or regimen.

In other embodiments a sample e.g. a tumor or normal tissue sample blood sample or bone marrow sample obtained from the patient is cultured in in vitro systems to assess the cancer stem cell population or amount of cancer stem cells. For example tumor samples can be cultured on soft agar and the amount of cancer stem cells can be correlated to the ability of the sample to generate colonies of cells that can be visually counted. Colony formation is considered a surrogate measure of stem cell content and thus can be used to quantitate the amount of cancer stem cells. For instance with hematological cancers colony forming assays include colony forming cell CFC assays long term culture initiating cell LTC IC assays and suspension culture initiating cell SC IC assays. In this way the colony forming or related assay could be used to measure cancer stem cell amount pre and post therapy to assess the change in cancer stem cell amount arising from a given therapy or regimen.

In other embodiments sphere formation is measured to determine the amount of cancer stem cells in a sample e.g. cancer stem cells form three dimensional clusters of cells called spheres in appropriate media that is conducive to forming spheres. Spheres can be quantitated to provide a measure of cancer stem cells. See Singh et al. Cancer Res 63 5821 5828 2003 . Secondary spheres can also be measured. Secondary spheres are generated when the spheres that form from the patient sample are broken apart and then allowed to reform. In this way the sphere forming assay could be used to measure cancer stem cell amount pre and post therapy to assess the change in cancer stem cell amount arising from a given therapy or regimen.

In other embodiments the amount of cancer stem cells in a sample can be determined with a cobblestone assay. Cancer stem cells from certain hematological cancers form cobblestone areas CAs when added to a culture containing a monolayer of bone marrow stromal cells. For instance the amount of cancer stem cells from a leukemia sample can be assessed by this technique. The tumor samples are added to the monolayer of bone marrow stromal cells. The leukemia cancer stem cells more so than the bulk leukemia cells have the ability to migrate under the stromal layer and seed the formation of a colony of cells which can be seen visually under phase contrast microscopy in approximately 10 14 days as CAs. The number of CAs in the culture is a reflection of the leukemia cancer stem cell content of the tumor sample and is considered a surrogate measure of the amount of stem cells capable of engrafting the bone marrow of immunodeficient mice. This assay can also be modified so that the CAs can be quantitated using biochemical labels of proliferating cells instead of manual counting in order to increase the throughput of the assay. See Chung et al. Blood 105 1 77 84 2005 . In this way the cobblestone assay could be used to measure cancer stem cell amount pre and post therapy to assess the change in cancer stem cell amount arising from a given therapy or regimen.

In other embodiments a sample e.g. a tumor or normal tissue sample blood sample or bone marrow sample obtained from the patient is analyzed in in vivo systems to determine the cancer stem cell population or amount of cancer stem cells. In certain embodiments for example in vivo engraftment is used to quantitate the amount of cancer stem cells in a sample. In vivo engraftment involves implantation of a human specimen with the readout being the formation of tumors in an animal such as in immunocompromised or immunodeficient mice such as NOD SCID mice . Typically the patient sample is cultured or manipulated in vitro and then injected into the mice. In these assays mice can be injected with a decreasing amount of cells from patient samples and the frequency of tumor formation can be plotted vs. the amount of cells injected to determine the amount of cancer stem cells in the sample. Alternatively the rate of growth of the resulting tumor can be measured with larger or more rapidly advancing tumors indicating a higher cancer stem cell amount in the patient sample. In this way an in vivo engraftment model assay could be used to measure cancer stem cell amount pre and post therapy to assess the change in cancer stem cell amount arising from a given therapy or regimen.

In certain in vivo techniques an imaging agent or diagnostic moiety is used which binds to molecules on cancer cells or cancer stem cells e.g. cancer cell or cancer stem cell surface antigens. For instance a fluorescent tag radionuclide heavy metal or photon emitter is attached to an antibody including an antibody fragment that binds to a cancer stem cell surface antigen. Exemplary cancer stem cell surface antigens are listed above in Table 2. The medical practitioner can infuse the labeled antibody into the patient either prior to during or following treatment and then the practitioner can place the patient into a total body scanner developer which can detect the attached label e.g. fluorescent tag radionuclide heavy metal photon emitter . The scanner developer e.g. CT MRI or other scanner e.g. detector of fluorescent label that can detect the label records the presence amount quantity and bodily location of the bound antibody. In this manner the mapping and quantitation of tag e.g. fluorescence radioactivity etc. in patterns i.e. different from patterns of normal stem cells within a tissue within a tissue or tissues indicates the treatment efficacy within the patient s body when compared to a reference control such as the same patient at an earlier time point or a patient or healthy individual who has no detectable cancer. For example a large signal relative to a reference range or a prior treatment date or prior to treatment at a particular location indicates the presence of cancer stem cells. If this signal is increased relative to a prior date it suggests a worsening of the disease and failure of therapy or regimen. Alternatively a signal decrease indicates that the therapy or regimen has been effective.

In a specific embodiment the amount of cancer stem cells is detected in vivo in a subject according to a method comprising the steps of a administering to the subject an effective amount of a labeled cancer stem cell marker binding agent that binds to a cell surface marker found on the cancer stem cells and b detecting the labeled agent in the subject following a time interval sufficient to allow the labeled agent to concentrate at sites in the subject where the cancer stem cell surface marker is expressed. In accordance with this embodiment the cancer stem cell surface marker binding agent is administered to the subject according to any suitable method in the art for example parenterally such as intravenously or intraperitoneally. In accordance with this embodiment the effective amount of the agent is the amount which permits the detection of the agent in the subject. This amount will vary according to the particular subject the label used and the detection method employed. For example it is understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging system used will determine the amount of labeled agent needed to detect the agent in a subject using an imaging means. In the case of a radiolabeled agent for a human subject the amount of labeled agent administered is measured in terms of radioactivity for example from about 5 to 20 millicuries of Tc. The time interval following the administration of the labeled agent which is sufficient to allow the labeled agent to concentrate at sites in the subject where the cancer stem cell surface marker is expressed will vary depending on several factors for example the type of label used the mode of administration and the part of the subject s body that is imaged. In a particular embodiment the time interval that is sufficient is 6 to 48 hours 6 to 24 hours or 6 to 12 hours. In another embodiment the time interval is 5 to 20 days or 5 to 10 days. The presence of the labeled cancer stem cell surface marker binding agent can be detected in the subject using imaging means known in the art. In general the imaging means employed depend upon the type of label used. Skilled artisans will be able to determine the appropriate means for detecting a particular label. Methods and devices that may be used include but are not limited to computed tomography CT whole body scan such as position emission tomography PET magnetic resonance imaging MRI and sonography. In a specific embodiment the cancer stem cell surface marker binding agent is labeled with a radioisotope and is detected in the patient using a radiation responsive surgical instrument Thurston et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 441 050 . In another embodiment the cancer stem cell surface marker binding agent is labeled with a fluorescent compound and is detected in the patient using a fluorescence responsive scanning instrument. In another embodiment the cancer stem cell surface marker binding agent is labeled with a positron emitting metal and is detected in the patient using positron emission tomography. In yet another embodiment the cancer stem cell surface marker binding agent is labeled with a paramagnetic label and is detected in a patient using magnetic resonance imaging MRI .

Any in vitro or in vivo ex vivo assays known to those skilled in the art that can detect and or quantify cancer stem cells can be used to monitor cancer stem cells in order to evaluate the prophylactic and or therapeutic utility of a cancer therapy or regimen disclosed herein for cancer or one or more symptoms thereof or these assays can be used to assess the prognosis of a patient. The results of these assays then may be used to possibly maintain or alter the cancer therapy or regimen.

The amount of cancer stem cells in a specimen can be compared to a predetermined reference range and or an earlier amount of cancer stem cells previously determined for the subject either prior to or during therapy in order to gauge the subject s response to the treatment regimens described herein. In a specific embodiment a stabilization or reduction in the amount of cancer stem cells relative to a predetermined reference range and or earlier cancer stem cell amount previously determined for the subject prior to during and or after therapy indicates that the therapy or regimen was effective and thus possibly an improvement in the subject s prognosis whereas an increase relative to the predetermined reference range and or cancer stem cell amount detected at an earlier time point indicates that the therapy or regimen was ineffective and thus possibly the same or a worsening in the subject s prognosis. The cancer stem cell amount can be used with other standard measures of cancer to assess the prognosis of the subject and or efficacy of the therapy or regimen such as response rate durability of response relapse free survival disease free survival progression free survival and overall survival. In certain embodiments the dosage frequency and or duration of administration of a therapy is modified as a result of the determination of the amount or change in relative amount of cancer stem cells at various time points which may include prior to during and or following therapy.

The present invention also relates to methods for determining that a cancer therapy or regimen is effective at targeting and or impairing cancer stem cells by virtue of monitoring cancer stem cells over time and detecting a stabilization or decrease in the amount of cancer stem cells during and or following the course of the cancer therapy or regimen.

In a certain embodiment a therapy or regimen may be marketed as an anti cancer stem cell therapy or regimen based on the determination that a therapy or regimen is effective at targeting and or impairing cancer stem cells by virtue of having monitored or detected a stabilization or decrease in the amount of cancer stem cells during therapy.

As part of the therapeutically effective regimens of the invention the amount of cancer cells alone or in combination with the amount of cancer stem cells can be monitored assessed using standard techniques known to one of skill in the art. In certain embodiments of the therapeutically effective regimens of the invention the regimens result in a stabilization or reduction in the amount expressed e.g. as a percentage of cancer cells in the subject. In one embodiment the subject undergoing the regimen is monitored to determine whether the regimen has resulted in a stabilization or reduction in the amount expressed e.g. as a percentage of cancer cells in the subject.

In some embodiments the amount of cancer cells is assessed in a subject using techniques described herein or known to one of skill in the art. In other embodiments the amount of cancer cells is detected in a sample. Such samples include but are not limited to biological samples and samples derived from a biological sample. In certain embodiments in addition to the biological sample itself or in addition to material derived from the biological sample such as cells the sample used in the methods of this invention comprises added water salts glycerin glucose an antimicrobial agent paraffin a chemical stabilizing agent heparin an anticoagulant or a buffering agent. In certain embodiments the biological sample is blood serum urine bone marrow or interstitial fluid. In another embodiment the sample is a tissue sample. In a particular embodiment the tissue sample is breast colon lung liver ovarian pancreatic prostate renal bone or skin tissue. In a specific embodiment the tissue sample is a biopsy including a tumor biopsy. The amount of biological sample taken from the subject will vary according to the type of biological sample and the method of detection to be employed. In a particular embodiment the biological sample is blood serum or urine and the amount of blood serum or urine taken from the subject is 0.1 ml 0.5 ml 1 ml 5 ml 10 ml or more. In another embodiment the biological sample is a tissue and the amount of tissue taken from the subject is less than 10 milligrams less than 25 milligrams less than 50 milligrams less than 1 gram less than 5 grams less than 10 grams less than 50 grams or less than 100 grams.

In accordance with the methods of the invention a sample derived from a biological sample is one in which the biological sample has been subjected to one or more pretreatment steps prior to the detection and or measurement of the cancer cell population in the sample. In certain embodiments a biological fluid is pretreated by centrifugation filtration precipitation dialysis or chromatography or by a combination of such pretreatment steps. In other embodiments a tissue sample is pretreated by freezing chemical fixation paraffin embedding dehydration permeablization or homogenization followed by centrifugation filtration precipitation dialysis or chromatography or by a combination of such pretreatment steps. In certain embodiments the sample is pretreated by removing cells other than cancer cells from the sample or removing debris from the sample prior to the determination of the amount of cancer cells in the sample according to the methods of the invention.

The samples for use in the methods of this invention may be taken from any animal subject preferably a mammal most preferably a human. The subject from which a sample is obtained and utilized in accordance with the methods of this invention includes without limitation an asymptomatic subject a subject manifesting or exhibiting 1 2 3 4 or more symptoms of cancer a subject clinically diagnosed as having cancer a subject predisposed to cancer a subject suspected of having cancer a subject undergoing therapy for cancer a subject that has been medically determined to be free of cancer e.g. following therapy for the cancer a subject that is managing cancer or a subject that has not been diagnosed with cancer.

In certain embodiments the amount of cancer cells is assessed in a subject or a sample from a subject at least 1 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 15 16 18 20 or 30 60 90 days 6 months 9 months 12 months 12 months after the subject begins receiving the regimen. In certain embodiments the amount of cancer cells is assessed after a number of doses e.g. after 1 2 5 10 20 30 or more doses of a therapy . In other embodiments the amount of cancer cells is assessed after 2 weeks 1 month 2 months 1 year 2 years 3 years 4 years or more after receiving one or more therapies.

The amount of cancer cells in a sample can be expressed as the percentage of e.g. overall cells in the sample. In some embodiments the sample is a blood sample or bone marrow sample wherein the amount of cancer cells per unit of volume e.g. 1 mL or other measured unit e.g. per unit field in the case of a histological analysis is quantitated. The cancer cell population in certain embodiments can be determined as a percentage of the total blood cells.

In other embodiments the sample from the patient is a tissue sample e.g. a biopsy from a subject with or suspected or having cancerous tissue where the amount of cancer cells can be measured for example by immunohistochemistry or on the basis of the amount of cancer cells per unit weight of the tissue.

The amount of cancer cells in the test sample can be compared with the amount of cancer cells measured in a reference sample s to assess the efficacy of the regimen. In one embodiment the reference sample is a sample from the subject undergoing therapy at an earlier time point e.g. prior to receiving the regimen as a baseline reference sample or at an earlier time point while receiving the therapy . In this embodiment the therapy desirably results in a decrease in the amount of cancer cells in the test sample as compared with the reference sample. In another embodiment the reference sample is obtained from a healthy subject who has no detectable cancer or from a patient that is in remission for the same type of cancer. In this embodiment the therapy desirably results in the test sample having an equal amount of cancer cells as detected in the reference sample e.g. no detectable cancer cells .

If the reduction in the amount of cancer cells is judged too small then the medical practitioner has a number of options to adjust the regimen. For instance the medical practitioner can then either increase the dosage of the therapy administered the frequency of the administration the duration of administration combine the therapy with another therapy ies halt the therapy or any combination thereof.

The amount of cancer cells can be monitored assessed using standard techniques known to one of skill in the art. Cancer cells can be monitored by e.g. obtaining a sample such as a tumor sample blood sample or bone marrow sample from a subject and detecting cancer cells in the sample. The amount of cancer cells in a sample which may be expressed as a percentage can be assessed by detecting the expression of antigens on cancer cells and or by detecting the proliferation of cancer cells. Techniques known to those of skilled in the art can be used for measuring these activities. For example cellular proliferation can be assayed by 3H thymidine incorporation assays and trypan blue cell counts. Antigen expression can be assayed for example by immunoassays including but are not limited to western blots immunohistochemistry radioimmunoassays ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay sandwich immunoassays immunoprecipitation assays precipitin reactions gel diffusion precipitin reactions immunodiffusion assays agglutination assays complement fixation assays immunoradiometric assays fluorescent immunoassays protein A immunoassays fluorescence activated cell sorter FACS analysis flow cytometry and immunofluorescence.

The amount of cancer cells can be compared to a predetermined reference range and or an earlier amount of cancer cells determined for the subject to gauge the subject s response to the regimens described herein. In a specific embodiment a reduction in the amount of cancer cells relative to a predetermined reference range and or earlier cancer cell amount determined for the subject indicate an improvement in the subject s prognosis or response to a therapy whereas an increase relative to the predetermined reference range and or earlier cancer cell numbers indicates the same or worse prognosis or failure to respond to a therapy. In certain embodiments the dosage frequency and or duration of administration of a therapy is modified as a result of the change in the amount of cancer cells.

In some embodiments the cancer cell population can be monitored assessed using gross measurements of the cancer cell population. For example in some embodiments the cancer cell population is determined using imaging methods such as computed tomography CT magnetic resonance imaging MRI ultrasound X ray imaging mammography radionuclide imaging PET scan palpitation direct measurement e.g. with a ruler or bone scans.

In embodiments of the invention comprising treatment of solid tumors the bulk size of the tumor may provide an estimate of the cancer cell population. A number of known methods can be used to assess the bulk size of the tumor. Non limiting examples of such methods include imaging methods e.g. computed tomography CT magnetic resonance imaging MRI PET scans palpitation direct measurement e.g. with a ruler ultrasound X ray imaging mammography bone scans and radioisotope imaging visual methods e.g. colonoscopy bronchoscopy endoscopy physical examination e.g. prostate examination breast examination lymph nodes examination abdominal examination general palpation blood tests e.g. prostate specific antigen PSA test carcinoembryonic antigen CEA test cancer antigen CA 125 test alpha fetoprotein AFP bone marrow analyses e.g. in cases of hematological malignancies histopathology cytology and flow cytometry.

In some embodiments the bulk tumor size can be measured by assessments based on the size of tumor lesions determined from imaging methods. In specific embodiments the assessments are performed in accordance with the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors RECIST Guidelines which are set forth in Therasse et al. J Nat Canc Inst 92 3 205 216 2000 . For instance in specific embodiments lesions in the subject that are representative of bulk tumor size are selected so that they are at least 20 mm in their longest diameter at baseline prior to treatment when conventional imaging techniques are used e.g. conventional CT scan MRI or x ray and lesions that are at least 10 mm in their longest diameter at baseline should be selected when spiral CT scanning is used.

As part of the prophylactically and or therapeutically effective regimens of the invention peripheral blood lymphocyte counts can be monitered assessed using standard techniques known to one of skill in the art.

Antibodies and antibody conjugates of the invention may be characterized in a variety of ways well known to one of skill in the art. In particular antibodies or conjugates of the invention may be assayed for the ability to bind to the IL3R alpha chain. Such an assay may be performed in solution e.g. Houghten 1992 Bio Techniques 13 412 421 on beads Lam 1991 Nature 354 82 84 on chips Fodor 1993 Nature 364 555 556 on bacteria U.S. Pat.

Biol. 222 301 310 each of these references is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference . Antibodies or conjugates that have been identified to bind to the IL3R alpha chain or a fragment thereof can then be assayed for their specificity and affinity for the IL3R alpha chain.

The antibodies or conjugates may be assayed for specific binding to the IL3R alpha chain and cross reactivity with other antigens by any method known in the art. Immunoassays which can be used to analyze specific binding and cross reactivity include but are not limited to competitive and non competitive assay systems using techniques such as western blots radioimmunoassays ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay sandwich immunoassays immunoprecipitation assays precipitin reactions gel diffusion precipitin reactions immunodiffusion assays agglutination assays complement fixation assays immunoradiometric assays fluorescent immunoassays protein A immunoassays to name but a few. Such assays are routine and well known in the art see e.g. Ausubel et al eds 1994 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Vol. 1 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . Exemplary immunoassays are described briefly below but are not intended by way of limitation .

Immunoprecipitation protocols generally comprise lysing a population of cells in a lysis buffer such as RIPA buffer 1 NP 40 or Triton X 100 1 sodium deoxycholate 0.1 SDS 0.15 MaCl 0.01 M sodium phosphate at pH 7.2 1 Trasylol supplemented with protein phosphatase and or protease inhibitors e.g. EDTA PMSF aprotinin sodium vanadate adding the antibody or conjugate of interest to the cell lysate incubating for a period of time e.g. 1 to 4 hours at 40 C adding protein A and or protein G sepharose beads to the cell lysate incubating for about an hour or more at 40 C washing the beads in lysis buffer and resuspending the beads in SDS sample buffer. The ability of the antibody or conjugate of interest to immunoprecipitate a particular antigen can be assessed by e.g. western blot analysis. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the binding of the antibody to an antigen and decrease the background e.g. pre clearing the cell lysate with sepharose beads . For further discussion regarding immunoprecipitation protocols see e.g. Ausubel et al eds 1994 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Vol. 1 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York at 10.16.1.

Western blot analysis generally comprises preparing protein samples electrophoresis of the protein samples in a polyacrylamide gel e.g. 8 20 SDS PAGE depending on the molecular weight of the antigen transferring the protein sample from the polyacrylamide gel to a membrane such as nitrocellulose PVDF or nylon blocking the membrane in blocking solution e.g. PBS with 3 BSA or non fat milk washing the membrane in washing buffer e.g. PBS Tween 20 blocking the membrane with primary antibody e.g. the antibody of interest diluted in blocking buffer washing the membrane in washing buffer blocking the membrane with a secondary antibody which recognizes the primary antibody e.g. an anti human antibody conjugated to an enzymatic substrate e.g. horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase or radioactive molecule e.g. P or I diluted in blocking buffer washing the membrane in wash buffer and detecting the presence of the antigen. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected and to reduce the background noise. For further discussion regarding western blot protocols see e.g. Ausubel et al eds 1994 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Vol. 1 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York at 10.8.1.

ELISAs comprise preparing antigen coating the well of a 96 well microtiter plate with the antigen adding the antibody of interest conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate e.g. horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase to the well and incubating for a period of time and detecting the presence of the antigen. In ELISAs the antibody of interest does not have to be conjugated to a detectable compound instead a second antibody which recognizes the antibody of interest conjugated to a detectable compound may be added to the well. Further instead of coating the well with the antigen the antibody may be coated to the well. In this case a second antibody conjugated to a detectable compound may be added following the addition of the antigen of interest to the coated well. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected as well as other variations of ELISAs known in the art. For further discussion regarding ELISAs see e.g. Ausubel et al eds 1994 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Vol. 1 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York at 11.2.1.

The binding affinity of an antibody to an antigen and the off rate of an antibody antigen interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled antigen e.g. H or I with the antibody of interest in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled antigen and the detection of the antibody bound to the labeled antigen. The affinity of an antibody of the present invention for the IL3R alpha chain and the binding off rates can be determined from the data by scatchard plot analysis. Competition with a second antibody can also be determined using radioimmunoassays. In this case the IL3R alpha chain is incubated with an antibody of the present invention conjugated to a labeled compound e.g. H or I in the presence of increasing amounts of an unlabeled second antibody.

In a preferred embodiment BIAcore kinetic analysis is used to determine the binding on and off rates of antibodies or conjugates to the IL3R alpha chain. BIAcore kinetic analysis comprises analyzing the binding and dissociation of the IL3R alpha chain from chips with immobilized antibodies or conjugates on their surface.

The antibodies conjugates pharmaceutical compositions and regimens of the invention can be tested in vitro and or in vivo for their ability to reduce the quantity number amount or percentage of cancer cells and or cancer stem cells or inhibit their proliferation. The ability of a conjugate or a regimen of the invention to reduce the quantity number amount or percentage of cancer cells cancer stem cells and or immune cells e.g. lymphocytes or inhibit their proliferation can be assessed by detecting the expression of antigens on cancer cells cancer stem cells and immune cells detecting the proliferation or viability of cancer cells cancer stem cells and immune cells detecting the effector function of cancer cells and cancer stem cells. Techniques known to those of skilled in the art can be used for measuring these activities. For example cellular proliferation can be assayed by H thymidine incorporation assays and trypan blue cell counts. Antigen expression can be assayed for example by immunoassays including but are not limited to competitive and non competitive assay systems using techniques such as western blots immunohistochemistry radioimmunoassays ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay sandwich immunoassays immunoprecipitation assays precipitin reactions gel diffusion precipitin reactions immunodiffusion assays agglutination assays complement fixation assays immunoradiometric assays fluorescent immunoassays protein A immunoassays flow cytometry and FACS analysis.

An antibody antibody conjugate pharmaceutical composition or regimen of the invention is preferably tested in vitro and then in vivo for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity prior to use in humans. For example assays which can be used to determine whether administration of a specific antibody or antibody conjugate is indicated include cell culture assays in which a patient tissue sample e.g. a cancer cell or cancer stem cell is grown in culture and exposed to or otherwise contacted with an antibody or antibody conjugate of the invention and the effect of such antibody or antibody conjugate upon the tissue sample is observed. The tissue sample can be obtained by biopsy from the patient. This test allows the identification of the therapeutically most effective therapy e.g. prophylactic or therapeutic agent for each individual patient.

Determination of cell viability using the XTT assay In some cases CD34 cells are isolated from human cord blood using magnetic beads coated with anti CD34 antibody. Isolated cells are then counted and aliquoted into 96 well plates and then incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of an antibody or antibody conjugate of the invention. Cell viability it measured by the addition of the XTT colorimetric reagent. Viability is determined by the absorbance of treated cultures at approximately 450 500 nm compared to untreated cultures. In other cases the cells used in the assay may be a leukemia cell line such as MV4 11. The assay can also be used to determine the time course of cell killing by various compounds by performing the XTT assay on cultures that are incubated with the antibody or antibody conjugate for varying periods of time.

Cobblestone assay The cobblestone area forming cell CAFC assay exploits a reproducible visual end point for the quantitation of cancer stem cells. Leukemia samples are added to adherent cultures of stromal cells some embodiments MS 5 stromal cells. The cancer stem cells in the culture will migrate below the MS 5 stromal cells and form a colony of cells called a cobblestone that can be visual quantitated. To test the effect of an antibody or antibody conjugate of the invention on the cancer stem cell population using this assay cells are first cultured in the presence of the drug. In some embodiments the cells are cultured for 16 hours. After this incubation the cells are added to the stromal cultures. A reduction in the cobblestone area formation in cultures that were treated with the drug compared to the untreated cells represents cancer stem cell activity for the drug.

The antibodies antibody conjugates pharmaceutical compositions and regimens of the invention can be tested in suitable animal model systems prior to use in humans. Such animal model systems include but are not limited to rats mice chicken cows monkeys pigs dogs rabbits etc. Any animal system well known in the art may be used. Several aspects of the procedure may vary said aspects include but are not limited to the temporal regime of administering the therapeutic modalities e.g. prophylactic and or therapeutic agents whether such therapeutic modalities are administered separately or as an admixture and the frequency of administration of the therapeutic modalities.

Animal models for cancer can be used to assess the efficacy of an antibody antibody conjugate a combination therapy or pharmaceutical composition of the invention.

In some embodiments of the invention the efficacy of the therapeutic regimen in reducing the quantity number amount or percentage of cancer stem cells in animals including humans undergoing treatment can be evaluated using in vivo techniques. In these embodiments an imaging agent is used which binds to biological moieties on cancer stem cells e.g. cancer stem cell surface antigens. For instance a fluorescent tag or radionuclide is covalently attached to an antibody that binds to a cancer stem cell surface antigen. The medical practitioner can infuse the labeled antibody into the patient either untreated or undergoing treatment and then the practitioner can place the patient into a total body scanner developer which can detect the attached label e.g. fluorescent tag or radionuclide . The scanner developer e.g. CT or MRI scanner records the presence and bodily location of the bound antibody. In this manner the mapping and quantitation of tag e.g. fluorescence radioactivity in patterns i.e. different from patterns of normal stem cells within a tissue within a tissue or tissues indicates the treatment efficacy within the patient s body. For example a large signal relative to a reference range or a prior treatment date at a particular location indicates the presence of cancer stem cells. If this signal is increased relative to a prior treatment date it suggests a worsening of the disease and failure of therapy. Alternatively a signal decrease indicates that therapy is working.

Similarly in some embodiments of the invention the efficacy of the therapeutic regimen in reducing the quantity number amount or percentage of cancer cells in animals including humans undergoing treatment can be evaluated using in vivo techniques. In one embodiment the medical practitioner performs the imaging technique with labeled molecule that binds the surface of a cancer cell e.g. a cancer cell surface antigen. In this manner the mapping and quantitation of tag e.g. fluorescence radioactivity in patterns within a tissue or tissues indicates the treatment efficacy within the body of the patient undergoing treatment.

In a specific embodiment the amount of cancer stem cells is detected in vivo in a subject according to a method comprising the steps of a administering to the subject an effective amount of a labeled cancer stem cell marker binding agent that binds to a cell surface marker found on the cancer stem cells and b detecting the labeled agent in the subject following a time interval sufficient to allow the labeled agent to concentrate at sites in the subject where the cancer stem cell surface marker is expressed. In accordance with this embodiment the cancer stem cell surface marker binding agent is administered to the subject according to any suitable method in the art for example parenterally e.g. intravenously or intraperitoneally. In accordance with this embodiment the effective amount of the agent is the amount which permits the detection of the agent in the subject. This amount will vary according to the particular subject the label used and the detection method employed. For example it is understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging system used will determine the amount of labeled agent needed to detect the agent in a subject using imaging. In the case of a radiolabeled agent for a human subject the amount of labeled agent administered is measured in terms of radioactivity for example from about 5 to 20 millicuries of 99Tc. The time interval following the administration of the labeled agent which is sufficient to allow the labeled agent to concentrate at sites in the subject where the cancer stem cell surface marker is expressed will vary depending on several factors for example the type of label used the mode of administration and the part of the subject s body that is imaged. In a particular embodiment the time interval that is sufficient is 6 to 48 hours 6 to 24 hours or 6 to 12 hours. In another embodiment the time interval is 5 to 20 days or 5 to 10 days. The presence of the labeled cancer stem cell surface marker binding agent can be detected in the subject using imaging means known in the art. In general the imaging means employed depend upon the type of label used. Skilled artisans will be able to determine the appropriate means for detecting a particular label. Methods and devices that may be used include but are not limited to computed tomography CT whole body scan such as position emission tomography PET magnetic resonance imaging MRI fluorescence chemiluminescence and sonography. In a specific embodiment the cancer stem cell surface marker binding agent is labeled with a radioisotope and is detected in the patient using a radiation responsive surgical instrument Thurston et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 441 050 . In another embodiment the cancer stem cell surface marker binding agent is labeled with a fluorescent compound and is detected in the patient using a fluorescence responsive scanning instrument. In another embodiment the cancer stem cell surface marker binding agent is labeled with a positron emitting metal and is detected in the patient using positron emission tomography. In yet another embodiment the cancer stem cell surface marker binding agent is labeled with a paramagnetic label and is detected in a patient using magnetic resonance imaging MRI .

Further any assays known to those skilled in the art can be used to evaluate the prophylactic and or therapeutic utility of an antibody antibody conjugate or pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein for cancer or one or more symptoms thereof.

The toxicity and or efficacy of antibodies antibody conjugates pharmaceutical compositions and regimens of the invention can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals e.g. for determining the LD the dose lethal to 50 of the population and the ED the dose therapeutically effective in 50 of the population . The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD ID. Therapeutic regimens that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While therapeutic regimens that exhibit toxic side effects may be used care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such agents to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and thereby reduce side effects.

The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage of the therapies for use in humans. The dosage of such agents lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the EDwith little or no toxicity to normal tissues. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any therapy used in the method of the invention the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC i.e. the concentration of the test antibody or test antibody conjugate that achieves a half maximal inhibition of symptoms as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels of antibodies or antibody conjugates in plasma may be measured for example by high performance liquid chromatography.

Hybridoma cells of the monoclonal antibodies 26292 32701 and 32716 were obtained from StemLine Therapeutics Inc. New York N.Y. and grown in DMEM medium with 10 FBS. TF 1 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection ATCC and grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 10 FBS and 2 ng ml GM CSF. Molm 13 and Molm 14 were provided by Dr. Robert J. Arceci Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center Johns Hopkins University and grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 10 FBS. ML 1 was obtained from the National Cancer Institute and grown in IMDM with 10 FBS. U937 was grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 10 FBS.

Total cellular RNA was isolated from hybridoma cells using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit. Vand VcDNAs of the monoclonal antibodies were obtained by a RACE method using SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit Clontech as described in Pastan I Beers R Bera T K. Recombinant immunotoxins in the treatment of cancer. 2004 248 503 18. The prepared cDNAs were used as the template for PCR reactions for Vand V. The PCR products were cloned into the pCR4 TOPO vector using the TOPO TA cloning kit Invitrogen . Five independent clones for each chain were sequenced to exclude the possibility of PCR error. The obtained sequences were confirmed again by comparing sequences in GenBank. Then the Vand Vwere assembled into a single chain Fv scFv and fused to PE38. The expression and purification of scFv PE38 was conducted as described in Pastan et al above. 26292 Fv PE38 KDEL was constructed by replacing the PE38 portion from the expression plasmid with PE38 containing KDEL at the carboxyl terminus in the expression plasmid. See Kreitman R J Margulies I Stetler Stevenson M et al. Cytotoxic activity of disulfide stabilized recombinant immunotoxin RFB4 dsFv PE38 BL22 toward fresh malignant cells from patients with B cell leukemias. Clin Cancer Res 2000 6 1476 87.

FACS analysis was performed to measure the binding of the monoclonal antibodies or immunotoxins to CD123 expressing cells. For screening monoclonal antibodies with good binding affinity 2.5 10 TF 1 cells were incubated with 0.5 g ml of the anti CD123 monoclonal antibodies or MOPC 21 isotype control IgG Sigma in 200 l of PBS containing 5 FBS and 0.1 sodium azide. After incubation for 1 hour at 4 C. the cells were washed twice with the same buffer and incubated with R PE labeled goat F ab anti mouse IgG BioSource . After washing the cells were suspended in 0.5 ml of the buffer and the fluorescence associated with the live cells was measured using a FACSCalibur instrument BD Biosciences .

For cell staining using immunotoxins 2.5 10cells were incubated with different concentrations of immunotoxins for 1 hour at 4 C. followed by a rabbit anti PE38 polyclonal antibody. The PE38 was detected with R PE labeled goat F ab anti rabbit IgG BioSource . For sequential binding in competition assays the first immunotoxin was incubated with TF 1 for 1 hour followed by the second immunotoxin for an additional hour.

To evaluate CD123 expression on various leukemia cell lines 2.5 10cells were incubated with 10 g ml of R PE labeled 9F5 BD Pharmingen or R PE labeled isotype control IgG Sigma for 1 hour at 4 C. QuantiBRITE PE Beads BD Biosciences was used as a PE fluorescence standard. See Pannu K K Joe E T Iyer S B. Performance evaluation of QuantiBRITE phycoerythrin beads. Cytometry 2001 45 250 8.

Cytotoxicity on cell lines was measured by cell viability assay. Cells were seeded into 96 well plates at a concentration of 2 10cells well. Serial dilutions of immunotoxins in 0.2 human serum albumin HSA were added to the cells resulting in final concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1000 ng ml in 150 l. After incubation for 48 hours 10 l of WST 8 Dojindo Molecular Technologies was added to each well and the incubation was carried out for 4 hours at 37 C. The absorbance of the sample at 450 nm was measured with a reference wavelength of 650 nm. Cytotoxicity is defined by IC 50 inhibition of cell viability which is midway between the level of viability in the absence of toxin and that in the presence of 10 g ml of cycloheximide. All experiments were performed in triplicate. For stability assays 200 ng ml of 26292 Fv PE38 in HSA was incubated at 4 C. or 37 C. for varying times before evaluation in the cytotoxicity assay.

Seven anti CD123 monoclonal antibodies were analyzed by flow cytometry for their binding to CD123 on the surface of TF 1 a CD123 expressing leukemia cell line. In these studies a concentration of 0.5 g ml 3 nM was used to distinguish between high and low binders. As shown in monoclonal antibodies 26292 32701 and 32716 had the highest fluorescence intensity and were the best binders in the panel.

Total RNA from the hybridoma cells 26292 32701 and 32716 was prepared and used for cDNA amplification to clone the heavy and light chain Fvs. After sequencing confirmation the Fvs of the Vand Vwere linked together and cloned into an expression vector to construct the scFv PE38 recombinant immunotoxin V linker V PE38 as described in Pastan et al above. Each immunotoxin was expressed in and purified to near 95 homogeneity as indicated by SDS PAGE analysis . The yields ranged from 2 5 based on the amount of inclusion body protein used as the starting material.

Purified immunotoxins were incubated with TF 1 to test their binding to CD123 by flow cytometry . SS1P an immunotoxin targeting see Hassan R Bera T Pastan I. Mesothelin a new target for immunotherapy. Clin Cancer Res 2004 10 3937 42 which is not expressed on the surface of TF 1 was used as a negative control. After subtracting the background SS1P value the median fluorescence intensities MFIs of 26292 Fv PE38 32701 Fv PE38 and 32716 Fv PE38 were 39.7 18.9 and 33.5 respectively indicating that 26292 Fv PE38 32701 Fv PE38 and 32716 Fv PE38 bind specifically to TF 1. The apparent affinities of 26292 Fv PE38 32701 Fv PE38 and 32716 Fv PE38 on TF 1 determined by flow cytometry were 3.5 nM 8.2 nM and 1.4 nM respectively showing that these immunotoxins can bind TF 1 with high affinities. Typical data with immunotoxin 26292 Fv PE38 is shown in .

Cytotoxicity of these immunotoxins was tested on TF 1 . 26292 Fv PE38 had the best activity with an IC 200 ng ml. The average ICs from nine independent assays was 185 ng ml. 32701 Fv PE38 and 32716 Fv PE38 had lower activity and did not reach an ICat 1000 ng ml where a 25 decrease in cell viability was observed. Because 26292 Fv PE38 and 32716 Fv PE38 had similar binding abilities for CD123 and affinity data it was surprising to find that their cytotoxic activities were so different. The possibility that these immunotoxins bound to different epitopes on CD123 which affected their ability to kill cells was tested Competition assays in which cells were incubated with an excess of one immunotoxin followed by an excess of the second were carried out. If two immunotoxins bound to an overlapping epitope the fluorescence signal from the combination would be close to that of a single immunotoxin whereas if two immunotoxins bound to different epitopes the fluorescence signal from the combination would be close to the sum of two individual values.

The results of these experiments are shown in Table 3. When immunotoxins 32701 Fv PE38 and 32716 Fv PE38 were combined sequentially the fluorescent signal was close to that of the first immunotoxin added. In contrast when 26292 Fv PE38 was combined with either 32701 Fv PE38 or 32716 Fv PE38 the fluorescence was close to the sum of the two individual immunotoxins. These data indicate that immunotoxins 32701 Fv PE38 and 32716 Fv PE38 bind to an overlapping epitope on CD123 whereas 26292 Fv PE38 binds to a different epitope. Similar results using monoclonal antibodies instead of immunotoxins were obtained data not shown .

To be useful in therapy an immunotoxin must be stable for several hours at 37 C. in the circulation. Several single chain immunotoxins have been found to be unstable at 37 C. and disulfide bonded variants have been produced to overcome this difficulty. See Reiter Y Brinkmann U Lee B et al. Engineering antibody Fv fragments for cancer detection and therapy disulfide stabilized Fv fragments. Nat Biotechnol 1996 14 1239 45. To assess the stability of the most active immunotoxin 26292 Fv PE38 was incubated at 37 C. or 4 C. for 1 3 and 6 hours . After incubation at 37 C. for 6 hours there was no change in the activity of 26292 Fv PE38 showing that this immunotoxin is stable at a physiological temperature.

It is well established that antigen density on the cell surface of target cells plays an important role in the sensitivity of cells to immunotoxins. See Alexander R L Kucera G L Klein B et al. In vitro interleukin 3 binding to leukemia cells predicts cytotoxicity of a diphtheria toxin IL 3 fusion protein. Bioconjug Chem 2000 11 564 8 Alexander R L Ramage J Kucera G L et al. High affinity IL 3 receptor alpha subunit expression on blasts from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia correlates with cytotoxicity of a diphtheria toxin IL 3 fusion protein. Leuk Res 2001 25 875 81 and Kreitman R J Margulies I Stetler Stevenson M et al. Cytotoxic activity of disulfide stabilized recombinant immunotoxin RFB4 dsFv PE38 BL22 toward fresh malignant cells from patients with B cell leukemias. Clin Cancer Res 2000 6 1476 87. Therefore CD123 expression levels on several AML cell lines was assessed by flow cytometry using QuantiBRITE standard PE beads . For TF 1 6900 CD123 sites were detected per cell 9900 on Molm 13 13900 on Molm 14 and 1900 on ML 1 were detected. No expression on U937 was detected.

Because these cell lines all had low to moderate CD123 expression a more active derivative of 26292 Fv PE38 was produced by replacing the REDLK sequence at its carboxyl terminus with KDEL. The mutation of REDLK to KDEL has been reported to improve the cytotoxicity of immunotoxins toward a variety of antigens. See Kreitman R J Margulies I Stetler Stevenson M et al. Cytotoxic activity of disulfide stabilized recombinant immunotoxin RFB4 dsFv PE38 BL22 toward fresh malignant cells from patients with B cell leukemias. Clin Cancer Res 2000 6 1476 87 Kreitman R J Pastan I. Importance of the glutamate residue of KDEL in increasing the cytotoxicity of exotoxin derivatives and for increased binding to the KDEL receptor.

The cytotoxicity of 26292 Fv PE38 and 26292 Fv PE38 KDEL was determined on these cell lines . HB21 Fv PE40 an immunotoxin targeting the transferrin receptor highly expressed on most cancer cells see Batra J K Fitzgerald D J Chaudhary V K et al. Single chain immunotoxins directed at the human transferrin receptor containing exotoxin A or diphtheria toxin anti TFR Fv PE40 and DT388 anti TFR Fv . Mol Cell Biol 1991 11 2200 5 was used as a positive control to be sure the cells were sensitive to PE based immunotoxins. Results of these assays are summarized in Table 4.

For all of the cell lines expressing CD123 the activity of the immunotoxin was increased using the mutant immunotoxin containing KDEL in U937 with no immunotoxin. In two of three cell lines with moderate CD123 expression TF 1 and Molm 13 the KDEL variant was more active with ICs falling from 200 ng ml to 38 and 30 ng ml respectively. Molm 14 was less sensitive to the immunotoxins against CD123. The ML 1 cell line had very low CD123 expression and was resistant to the immunotoxin targeting CD123.

This example has described the production of three IL3R cytotoxin conjugates that target IL3R and their activities on IL3R expressing cell lines.
