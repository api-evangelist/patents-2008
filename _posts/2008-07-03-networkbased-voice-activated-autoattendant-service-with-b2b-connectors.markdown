The present disclosure relates generally to a network based auto attendant system and services relating thereto.

Early work in voice activated auto attendant technologies is based on customer premise equipment CPE platforms where a voice dial directory is built for a specific company. The data source for the directory is often limited to simple name dialing. This type of CPE based auto attendant application typically does not offer the caller advanced search capability via voice commands.

More recent systems use statistical analysis techniques to improve automatic speech recognition ASR performance on large company directories that may contain hundreds of thousands of employees and or associates. However these systems do not use web centric data interface technologies to access corporate data and do not take advantage of relationship intelligence often embedded in individual enterprise information technology IT systems.

Accordingly there is a need for an improved system and method of providing network based voice services.

The techniques disclosed use voice search engine technologies and carrier based directory services in general and focus particularly on the capability of searching a voice directory entry in a carrier s network with various B2B connectors via the world wide web WWW to enterprise information systems EIS .

Referring to further details regarding the system of are shown. The system includes the enterprise information system which is coupled to a B2B data connector via a corporate information technology virtual private network VPN . This corporate enterprise information system is coupled to the public internet via firewall . The public internet is connected to a secured server which in turn is coupled via firewall to the second data connector of the service provider network . The service provider network includes data processor which is coupled to the second B2B data connector . The communication between the first data connector of the enterprise information system and the second data connector of the voice service provider network is shown in greater detail in . Enterprise information system data sources are illustrated by the database connected to a first data connector . The particular type of data connector suitable for the enterprise data is selected. Example connector types include JDBC connector HTTP connector LDAP connector and XML connector . Once the appropriate connector type has been selected the data is converted from the data source to a converted XML directory . The XML directory is accessible via connector for an encryption and upload module . Converted and encrypted data is then uploaded via a communication connector and stored at the secured site . Optionally a copy of the XML directory may be stored in the XML directory database . Once the encrypted and uploaded data has been stored at the secured site the encrypted data may then be communicated via the firewall and the data connector for access and processing by the data processor within the voice service provider network .

In a particular embodiment the network based voice service network is provisioned via a web interface where each client which may be represented as an enterprise customer first downloads a platform independent B2B connector package. For example the package can be implemented in Enterprise Java Beans EJB for execution on various J2EE application servers to support different computer operating systems. The package can be reached via a local URL since it is installed on a local J2EE application server. From an initial set of provisioning screens a client administrator may interact with the package via a sequence of data modeling steps. Examples of data modeling steps are labeled connector one C connector two C and connector three C in .

Using data modeling at step a suitable type of data connector may be selected based on the type of enterprise information system data source. For example if the customer data source is stored in a relational database then the customer can select a JDBC connector and configure this connector to point to the appropriate database tables and corresponding entries. After the connector is fully configured it can be scheduled to run at a later time. The result of executing this connector is creation of data stored as a set of XML based data files in a format acceptable by the data processor . The XML based data files may be stored within XML directory . The XML data files may be encrypted using an encryption key that may be issued by the voice service provider network . After encryption the resulting encrypted data may be uploaded from a host server to a secured website such as the secured website that is hosted on the service provider network via the world wide web. The uploading process may be initiated on the host that has been issued a special security certificate for connection to the secured site . Using secured sites and encrypted data may prevent or reduce unauthorized connection or virus attacks to the entry point of the network.

Since there may be thousands of clients sites which may initiate uploading tasks independently the uploading processes may be divided into multiple small payloads to avoid unpredictable connection patterns associated with public internet traffic. For each successful upload the encryption and upload module also keeps a local copy in the copy directory . At a subsequent time only the differences between the local copy files and the new version to be uploaded is sent to the secured site . Once a complete XML data set from a client s site has been received by the secured site it would trigger the data processor to parse the XML data files and start to construct a voice directory. In addition the XML files are parsed to create and update a first database such as the enterprise voice directory and a second database such as the precompiled voice directory grammar database for run time access.

Referring to a sample data record with many different data fields from a stored voice directory is shown. The voice directories are formed within the enterprise voice directory database . The voice directories were constructed from data received at the secured internet site . A sample record from one of the voice directories is illustrated in . The sample record includes a plurality of fields such as a type field a directory ID field a name field a location field a department field an uplink field a downlink field a URL field and a peerlink field . The uplink field includes a pointer to a supervisory or reporting to data record . The peer link field includes a pointer to a peer data record and the downlink field includes a subordinate data record link to the subordinate data record . As illustrated in sample information from the various fields are shown. For example the name field may include various names such as ABC Bank John Smith or Mary Johnson that may be input to the data processor . Similarly location data from the location field or department information from the department field may also be input and processed by the data processor . The processor receives various data information from the voice directory records and uses such information to construct precompiled voice directory grammars within the database . In addition the session manager and the dialog engine may retrieve and access records from the voice directory database .

As also illustrated in individual enterprise customers upload required data elements from their individual enterprise information systems to the voice activated auto attendant service provider network using the selected B2B connectors. The enterprise information data processors process and then store these data elements in the various databases such as the enterprise voice directory database that stores a centralized voice directory for various different enterprise customers. Voice directories are structured in a common schema that is recognized by both the session manager and dialog engine . Three unique links uplink downlink and peerlink are generated from the original enterprise data records. Each link is constructed to provide additional voice search capabilities for the end users of the network service to meet end user goals. An example is now shown to describe each link and a simple user interface dialogue session.

Referring to a further example of using the voice service network in connection with the user interface call recognition sample dialog is shown. A caller may request general information and may be asked by the voice service network for further information such as to provide information regarding a particular target addressee such as a department of a requested employee. For example where a caller requests a customer service department the dialog engine receives the input customer service . The dialog engine initiates a search of the enterprise voice directory based on the department name of customer service. The database may then retrieve a dynamic voice grammar that contains the names of employees in the customer service group such as Mary Jones or Greg Johnson as shown at . The dialog engine provides the names of available personnel within the customer service group and provides this information using the voice search engine . Based on a second customer input such as Mary Jones at the voice search engine may search and then identify the specific data record for Mary Jones from the available personnel list at . The voice activated auto attendant service provider network may then provide further details regarding Mary Jones and may route the call to the appropriate destination such as to Mary Jones telephone or work station.
