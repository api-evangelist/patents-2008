The present application generally relates to data communication networks. In particular the present application relates to systems and methods for providing a rate throttling of a rate of requests of objects transmitted via an intermediary across the network.

A typical enterprise provides many users access to servers via a network. With the explosion of content such as media the servers may provide access to and deliver a wide range of different objects. Some objects may be large. Other objects may be small. Accordingly certain objects consume more network resources and bandwidth than other objects. A user may request any type of object from a server. In some cases a user request a object that should be delivered with a higher priority than another object request. For example in an enterprise access to certain objects may be more important to operations than other objects. In some cases users of the enterprise network may request objects that are not business related. Sometimes the requests for these types of object impact the delivery of business related objects. With a wide range of users a high volume of user requests and different types of objects it is challenging to manage users access to these objects.

The present disclosure is related to a framework for an enterprise or a corporation to mitigate or prevent risks that could potentially impact resource availability and reliability by rate limiting access to an entity. A threat indicating an impending danger to servers of the enterprise may eventually lead to a loss of revenue. Appropriate preventive action may need to be taken in order to minimize or prevent threats. In order to prevent its resource from getting overwhelmed an enterprise may need a mechanism by which an administrator may specify a maximum load a resource can take in a given time frame. The rate limiting factor could be number of requests number of packets or bandwidth. Once an administrator specified threshold is exceeded a user may specify a desired action.

The present disclosure presents a solution to these and similar problems by presenting systems and method that enable the user on a network to specify the maximum load a resource can take within a specified time period. Such systems and method may help the user prevent overburdening of the resources.

In some aspects the present invention is related to a method for throttling a rate of requests for an object by an intermediary that receives requests between a client and a server. The intermediary may receive a request from a client for an object of a server. The intermediary may identify a policy specifying a mode of throttling for the request. The policy specifies a mode of throttling a rate threshold and a period of time for the rate threshold. A rate throttler of the intermediary may determine whether the request exceeds the rate threshold for the period of time based on the mode of throttling of the policy. The rate throttler may allow or block the request responsive to the determination.

In some embodiments the object may be identified based on one or more user specified selection criteria. In other embodiments the policy may be identified based on the identified object. In yet other embodiments the policy may specify the mode of throttling as bursty. In further embodiments the policy may specify the mode of throttling as smooth. In still further embodiments the policy may specify the mode of throttling based on a number of connections from the client. In yet further embodiments the policy may specify the mode of throttling based on bandwidth used by the client via the intermediary.

In some embodiments the rate throttler may determine that during a current time period specified by the period of time of the policy a number of requests for the object has exceeded the rate threshold. In other embodiments the rate throttler may block the request upon receipt of the request. In yet other embodiments the rate throttler may determine that during a current time period specified by the period of time of the policy a number of requests for the object is less than or equal to the rate threshold.

Similarly the bursty mode may be changed or modified according to the user criteria that identifies a new value indicating the period of time of the threshold period to replace the previous value of the period of time of the threshold period . Updated values of the bursty mode may be used by the rate throttler while throttling of the requests and objects thus affecting the flow of the objects and requests transmitted.

Smooth mode may be any throttling mode of operation of the rate throttler which allows the client to exhaust client s quota for transmission at a pace spread out over the entire selected time period. Smooth mode may utilize a rate threshold identifying a rate of transmission at any given moment within the threshold period in order to throttle the rate of objects traversing the appliance . For example the smooth mode may utilize a rate threshold identifying a predetermined amount of objects per second over a threshold period . The smooth mode will in this case allow the client to receive objects at a maximum rate of less than or equal to the predetermined amount of objects per second over the entire threshold period . However the smooth mode would regulate the transmission of the objects to the client never to exceed the amount of objects per second allowed and never to block transmissions to the client. The objects would not have to be blocked en route to the client since the amount of objects per second even if transmitted for the entirety of the threshold period would not exceed the client s quota.

Connections mode may be any throttling mode of operation of the rate throttler limiting a number of active transactions of the client. In some embodiments connections mode limits the number of connections between the client and server by using the rate threshold as the maximum number of allowable connections between the client and server over the threshold period . In some embodiments the rate threshold is the threshold of the number of sessions the client may establish with the server via the appliance . If the number of client requests to establish a session with the server exceeds the value of the rate threshold within the threshold period the rate throttler blocks the request for the session. In some embodiments when the number of client requests to establish a session with the server exceeds the rate threshold within the threshold period the rate throttler blocks session from being established between the client and server .

Bandwidth mode comprises a throttling mode based on bandwidth usage to determine the client s quota or client s transmission rate. In some embodiments bandwidth mode utilizes a bandwidth monitor to determine the bandwidth used by the session between the client and server to determine the rate threshold . The rate threshold may be set in terms of megabytes per second or objects per second. In some embodiments the bandwidth mode allow the policy to adjust the value of the rate threshold after determining by the appliance that the available bandwidth of the network has changed. In bandwidth mode the policy may adjust or update the rate threshold to more accurately determine the client s transmission rate by setting a new rate threshold . In some embodiments the policy may adjust or update the threshold period to more accurately determine the client s transmission rate by setting a new threshold period . For example in order to increase the client s transmission rate one can either increase the rate threshold leaving the threshold period unchanged or decrease threshold period and leave the rate threshold unchanged. Bandwidth mode may thus manage the client s quota by setting the rate threshold according the bandwidth available to the client and server or according to the bandwidth used by the client and server . Bandwidth mode may also manage client s transmission rate by managing or modifying the rate threshold per threshold period ratio. In some embodiments bandwidth mode may manage client s transmission rate by setting the rate threshold to a value corresponding to the rate of transmission such as objects per second rather than the number of transmission such as objects for example.

In an example of operation a selector from a user may include a selectlet identifying a timing interval within which bursty mode should replace any other throttling mode used by the rate throttler . The selector may also include another selectlet identifying a specific object of the server . The policy engine creates a policy which is configured to activate the bursty throttling mode at the user specified time. The policy engine also creates another policy which recognizes the user specified object or a request for the user specified object and chooses a connections mode once the user specified object or the request of the user specified object is encountered. At the user specified time the policy activates bursty mode and the rate throttler starts operating according to the bursty mode . Upon detecting the request for the user specified object the policy deactivates bursty mode and activates connections mode for the rate throttler . Rate throttler then throttles the user specified object according to the connections mode . The rate threshold and threshold period may also change with the change of the throttling modes allowing the rate throttler to keep track of events at both modes if necessary.

In some examples an appliance may be configured to run at a specific mode using a series of instructions and commands. Such commands may identify a selector named selector using commands add ns limit . In the following embodiment selector comprising selectlets named REQ.URL.HOSTNAME and REQ.METHOD is formed using an instruction such as

Referring now to a flow diagram of an embodiment of a method for throttling a rate of requests between a client and a server is illustrated. In brief overview of method at step an intermediary receives a request from a client for an object of a server. At step the intermediary identifies the object based on one or more user specified selection criteria. At step a policy engine of the intermediary identifies for the request a policy specifying a mode of throttling a rate threshold and a period of time for the rate threshold. At step a rate throttler determines whether the request exceeds the rate threshold for the period of time based on the mode of throttling of the policy. At step the rate throttler allows or blocks the request responsive to the determination.

In further overview at step an intermediary receives a request that includes an information relating an object of a server from any device on a network . In some embodiments the intermediary receives a request including an information related to a plurality of objects from one or more servers . The request may be any request to access or use any service provided by any server on the network. The request may include any information uniquely identifying the object such as an object identifier uniquely identifying the object and an internet protocol address uniquely identifying the server the object is located on. In some embodiments an intermediary receives from the client a request requesting an object from the server via the appliance . The object requested or included in the request s information may be any service provided by the server such as a client user session a connection between the client and the server an application provided by the server a file on the server or a data the client desires to retrieve from the server. In some embodiments the object referred to by the request is previously identified by the user via a selector or a selectlet . In other embodiments the object is selected by one or more user specified selection criteria such as the user criteria . The request may be a request for a specific object or a request comprising an information relating or identifying an object.

At step the intermediary identifies the object based on any number of user criteria or user selections. The intermediary may identify the object in response to the information relating the object from the request received by the intermediary . In some embodiments the intermediary receives the request and recognizes an object within the information of the request. The object may be identified via the name of the object within the information from the request. In some embodiments the information may include a unique identifier uniquely identifying the object. In further embodiments the information may include a unique identifier of the specific server serving or providing the object. The intermediary may identify the object by hashing the request and matching the hashed components against the user criteria . In some embodiments the intermediary identifies the object by hashing the request received by the appliance and matching the hashed components against the selectors or selectlets . The intermediary may identify the object by matching a portion of the request with a user input or a user selection from a component within the user criteria .

At step a policy engine of the intermediary identifies for the request one or more policies that specify any number of modes of throttling thresholds such as rate thresholds and periods of time for the thresholds such as the threshold periods. In some embodiments the policy engine identifies a policy that specifies or initiates a throttling mode for throttling a predetermined type of object. The policy engine may further specify a rate threshold for the throttling mode. In addition the policy engine may specify a threshold period for the specified mode of throttling. The throttling mode initiated by the policy may be identified by policy engine in response to the request or in response to a portion of the request. In some embodiments the throttling mode initiated by the policy may be identified by policy engine in response to an information associated with the request. The policy engine may identify the policy specifying a throttling mode based on a portion of the request identifying an object of the server . In other embodiments the throttling mode initiated by the policy may be identified by policy engine in response to the appliance identifying the client or the user on the client. In some embodiments the throttling mode initiated by the policy may be identified by policy engine in response to detection by the appliance that the traffic traversing the appliance is above the threshold of the traffic that sustained by the appliance .

In some embodiments the policy engine identifies a policy that specifies or initiates a throttling mode for throttling a plurality of requests identified by the request. The policy engine may also identify a policy that initiates and utilizes a plurality of throttling modes for throttling any number of requests. The policy may further specify additional instructions or parameters for initiating engaging disengaging operating or combining the operation of the plurality of throttling modes to be used by the rate throttler . In some embodiments the policy specifies a bursty mode as the mode of throttling. In some embodiments the policy specifies the smooth mode as the mode of throttling. In many embodiments the policy specifies the connections mode as the mode of throttling. In a number of embodiments the policy specifies the bandwidth mode as the mode of throttling. In many embodiments the policy specifies a combination of two or more modes of throttling. The modes of throttling may be combined such that one throttling mode is used for some requests from the client while other mode of throttling is used for other requests from the client. In some embodiments the combination of throttling modes is controlled by the policy which uses a first throttling mode for throttling a first portion of a request and a second throttling mode for throttling the second portion of the request.

At step a rate throttler determines if the request exceeds a threshold such as the rate threshold for the period of time such as the threshold period in accordance with any of the modes of throttling of the policy . The rate throttler may monitor and count the requests from the client to the server . The rate throttler may further compare the count of the number of requests against the rate threshold . In some embodiments the rate throttler compares the number of requests received from the client against the rate threshold within the time interval defined by the threshold period . In some embodiments rate throttler receives the determination that the request exceeds a threshold from another component of the appliance . In further embodiments the rate throttler determines if the request exceeds a threshold value based on a policy . In many embodiments the rate throttler determines if the request exceeds a threshold by counting a number of requests received within a time period identified by the threshold period . The rate throttler may compare the request count received within the time period such as the threshold period against the threshold such as the rate threshold .

At step the rate throttler allows blocks or delays the request responsive to the determination of step In some embodiments the rate throttler allows the request to traverse the appliance . In other embodiments the rate throttler blocks the request from traversing the appliance . In further embodiments the rate throttler delays the request for a period of time before transmitting the request to the destination such as the server . In some embodiments the rate throttler traverses the request blocks the request or delays the request in response to determination that the request exceeds the rate threshold within the threshold period . In many embodiments the rate throttler delays the request responsive to the rate threshold and threshold period . In some embodiments if the request from the client is less then the rate threshold but the request count is close to the rate threshold the rate throttler may delay transmission of the request in accordance with the difference of rate threshold and the client request count. In some embodiments if the request from the client is less than the rate threshold but the request count is close to the rate threshold the rate throttler may delay the transmission in accordance with the difference of the threshold period and the amount of time remaining within the threshold period at the time of receipt of the request.
