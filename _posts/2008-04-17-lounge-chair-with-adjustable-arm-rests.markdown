This application is a Continuation in Part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 963 938 entitled LOUNGE CHAIR WITH ADJUSTABLE ARM RESTS filed Oct. 12 2004 the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

This disclosure relates generally to pool patio and beach furniture and more particularly to a lounge chair having improved arm supporting features.

Referring to B A B and a conventional chaise lounge includes a U shaped adjustable back support a seat support a U shaped adjustable foot leg support and two arm rests . The back support and the foot leg support are adjustable because they attach to the seat support at the pivots . Through a familiar adjustment process the pivots may be used to position the back support and the foot leg support at different angles relative to the seat support .

Two U shaped leg supports are attached to the seat support and are pivotable with respect to the seat support . The leg supports engage the surface i.e. the patio the deck the beach the pool apron the ground beneath the seat support providing support for the entire chaise lounge . Body support material extends vertically down the center of the chaise lounge the support material attached to the portions of the back support seat support and foot leg support that are approximately parallel to the underlying support surface.

The back support includes a right side R and a left side L. Each arm rest is attached to a corresponding one of the right side R and the left side L of the back support by a securement device . Furthermore each arm rest includes a vertical brace .

In order to vertically adjust the position of the arm rest the securement device may be loosened to release its grip from the back support . The securement device along with the attached arm rest may then be moved to a different vertical position on the back support . For example referring to the position A of the securement device may be adjusted along the line CD where the line CD runs longitudinally through the center of the securement device . Once the securement device and arm rest are in the desired position the securement device is tightened to maintain its new position on the back support .

The position of the armrests may also be adjusted in two angular directions. Referring to an angle may be defined as the angle that the line AB makes with respect to the vertical plane that contains the line CD In this is the plane of the paper . The line AB runs longitudinally through the armrest . For example in the angle is zero degrees and in the angle is ninety degrees.

Following the same procedure that was described above for a vertical adjustment of the arm rest the angle may be adjusted. That is the securement device may be loosened to release its grip from the back support . The securement device along with the attached arm rest may then be rotated about the line CD to the desired position and retightened to maintain the desire position.

Referring to the angle may be defined as the angle between the line CD and the line AB that runs longitudinally through the armrest . For example A and illustrate a series of positions for the chaise lounge where the angle becomes increasingly larger. The angle may be adjusted by manipulating a lever not shown that forces a plate having starburst indentations to disengage from a matching plate whose facing surfaces interface with the starburst indentations. The disengagement allows the armrest to rotate in the direction. Once the desired position is reached the lever is released to allow the plate and matching plate to re engage.

In this conventional chaise lounge arm rest system the vertical brace must always be deployed to support the end of the arm rest . As shown in when the arm rest extends in a direction normal to the plane of the back support 0 the vertical brace engages the top of the seat support . As shown in when the arm rest is positioned in a direction parallel to the plane of the back support 90 the vertical brace engages the surface that is supporting the chaise lounge .

The vertical brace has a telescoping adjustment so that regardless of the position of the arm rest the end of the arm rest is always supported by the vertical brace that is in contact with either the chaise lounge or the surface that supports the chaise lounge .

Consequently with Zegeer s chaise lounge each time that it becomes desirable or necessary to reposition any one of the armrests up to three separate manual adjustments must be made to the armrest or to the securing device . For example if a change in the angular position or a change in the vertical position along the back support is desired the securing device must be loosened repositioned in the desired location and tightened. If a change in the angular position is desired the mechanism on the securing device that provides for this movement must be loosened the armrest repositioned and the mechanism tightened. Any time that the vertical position of the armrest is changed and in some cases when the angular position of the armrest is changed the telescoping adjustment of the vertical brace must be loosened adjusted for length and tightened.

Sunbathers are concerned about obtaining uniform exposure to the sun s rays. While this is obtainable with the chaise lounge described above in practice this would prove inconvenient since as the sun moves across the sky continuous adjustment of the armrests may be required to prevent the armrests and or the sunbather s arms from casting shadows on the sunbather. Sunbathers will also frequently change position to alternately expose the dorsal and ventral portions of their bodies. Furthermore any person who uses the chaise lounge can be expected to frequently change their sitting reclining lounging position to find the optimal comfort setting.

Thus it is desirable to quickly and easily reposition the armrests to provide support to the arms if the position of a person s body on the chaise lounge is changed. Performing up to six manually intensive adjustments each time a shift in the position of the arm rests is desired may be inconvenient.

Furthermore because the right side R and the left side L of the back support must remain clear of obstructions in order for the securing device to be vertically adjustable along the right and left sides of the back support the body supporting material will have an increased tendency to stretch and sag between the back support because it is only attached to the portions of the back support that are parallel to the ground. More effective support could be provided if the body supporting material was also attached to the right side R and left side L of the back support .

Embodiments of the invention address these and other disadvantages of the conventional art described above.

According to embodiments of the invention a lounge chair that includes two sets of arms provides increased convenience to persons who use the lounge chair. The first set of arms is primarily used when the person s dorsal side is in contact with the lounge chair. The second set of arms is primarily used when the person s ventral side is in contact with the lounge chair. However it will be recognized that either set of arms may be used in either situation depending on the tastes and desires of the person using the lounge chair.

Referring to a lounge chair according to some embodiments of the invention includes an adjustable back support a seat support an adjustable foot leg support two legs and four pivots . In the illustrated embodiments the back support the seat support the foot leg support and legs have a tubular metal construction.

The lounge chair also includes a first set of armrests that consist of a left armrest L and a right armrest R two securement devices that attach the left armrest L and the right armrest R to the back support and a second set of armrests that consist of a left armrest L and a right armrest R.

As shown in canvas is attached between the back support seat support and foot leg support providing a region where a person using the lounge chair may be supported. Before the lounge chair is assembled the canvas is fitted to the back support seat support and foot leg support . This may be easily accomplished by folding the outer edges of the canvas back onto itself and stitching a seam to hold the canvas together. This creates a sleeve that slides over the tubular metal frame that forms the back support the seat support and foot leg support .

It should be apparent that other materials besides canvas may be used depending on the design of the lounge chair. For example the material attached between the back support the seat support and the foot leg support may consist of many individual bands of plastic tubing canvas or other fabric. The individual bands of material may be attached to opposing sides of the back support the seat support and the foot leg support . The bands that are aligned in one direction may be interwoven with the bands of material that are aligned in a second direction to create a lightweight strong support for persons using the lounge chair . The first and second directions may be perpendicular to each other but they do not have to be.

Alternatively if a lounge chair having very firm support is required a wooden lounge chair may have wooden slats attached vertically or horizontally between the back support seat support or foot leg support . Alternatively lounge chairs according to embodiments of the invention may also be made of moldable plastic or for additional reinforcement plastic laminated with fiberglass.

As is well known in the art the position of the adjustable back support and the adjustable foot leg support with respect to the seat support may be varied by operation of the pivots which attach the back support and the foot leg support to the seat support . The legs are pivotably attached at either end to the seat support allowing the legs to be folded flat against the seat support when the lounge chair is not in use.

There are many different conventional ways in which the legs the seat support the back support and the foot leg support may be attached to each other and there are many different conventional shapes and designs that exist for legs seat supports back supports and foot leg supports. Likewise besides pivots there are many alternative conventional mechanisms that may be used to vary the angular relationship between seat support and the back support or to vary angular relationship between the seat support and the foot leg support .

A complete description of all such conventional variations and devices is not required as it will be apparent from the following description that embodiments of the invention may include any conventional furniture configuration where the angular position of the back support relative to the seat support may be adjusted. Thus the majority of the following detailed description of embodiments of the invention will be devoted to describing the adjustable arm rests and their movement.

As was explained above the securement devices attach the armrest L and R to the back support . Unlike the conventional securement devices described by Zegeer the securement devices are maintained in a fixed position on the back support . That is the securement devices do not move along the PQ or the WX line because of the presence of the canvas which is attached to the back support along three sides of the back support.

According to some embodiments of the invention such as those shown in the position of the securement device with respect to the PQ and WX lines may be permanently affixed. According to other embodiments of the invention the position of the securement devices along the PQ and WX line may be adjustable between the limits imposed by the canvas or other supporting material. Either way embodiments of the invention allow supporting material such as canvas to be attached to the upright portions of the back support as well as the horizontal portions of the back support. This is an advantage over the conventional chaise lounge described above because more effective support can be provided to the person who is using the lounge chair.

The securement devices whether fixed with respect to the PQ and WX lines or adjustable with respect to the PQ and WX lines allow movement of the armrests in at least two angular directions and .

Referring to for the armrest R an angle may be defined as the angle between the vertical plane that contains the PQ line and the line RS that runs longitudinally through the armrest R. Similarly for the armrest L an angle may be defined as the angle between the vertical plane that contains the WX line and the line YZ that runs longitudinally through the armrest L. As illustrated in the armrest R has an angle 0 and the armrest L has an angle 90.

For the armrest R an angle may be defined as the angle between the PQ line and the RS line. For the armrest L an angle may be defined as the angle between the WX line and the YZ line. As illustrated in the armrest R has an angle 0 and the armrest L has an angle 90.

As illustrated in each of the armrests is independently adjustable. Furthermore it should be recognized that the armrests and securement devices may be configured to allow for any particular adjustment limited only by the armrest impinging onto other structures of the lounge chair .

In preferred embodiments of the invention the armrests are configured to be adjusted by a person using the lounge chair through the simple method of pushing and pulling on the particular armrest to achieve the desired position. That is unlike the conventional chaise lounge described by Zegeer the securement devices do not require a manual loosening retightening to adjust the angular position of the armrests .

According to preferred embodiments of the invention the force required to push pull the armrests into a new position is greater than the force exerted by a person resting his or her arm upon one of the armrests . In some embodiments of the invention the securement devices may consist of a ball and socket joint. Other embodiments of the invention may use other types of securement devices besides ball and socket joints to achieve the same function.

Referring to preferred embodiments of the invention have a second set of armrests consisting of a right armrest R and a left armrest L. Typically a person using the lounge chair will only require the second set of armrests when the lounge chair is in a fully or partially reclined position. The second set of armrests provides a place where the person using the lounge chair may position and comfortably support her arms above her head. This situation may occur not only when the dorsal part of the body is facing upward but also when the ventral part of the body is facing upward.

As illustrated in each of the armrests is independently adjustable. Furthermore it should be recognized that the armrests may be configured to allow for any particular adjustment limited only by the armrest impinging onto other structures of the lounge chair .

In preferred embodiments of the invention the armrests are configured to be adjusted by a person using the lounge chair through the simple method of pushing and pulling on the particular armrest to achieve the desired position.

According to preferred embodiments of the invention the force required to push or pull the armrests into a new position is greater than the force exerted by a person resting his or her arm upon one of the armrests . In some embodiments of the invention the mechanism that allows for the movement of the armrests may consist of a ball and socket joint. Other embodiments of the invention may use other types of conventional mechanisms besides ball and socket joints to achieve the same function.

In the embodiments illustrated in there is no movement of the armrests along the lines PQ and WX. However in alternative embodiments of the invention there may be adjustable repositioning of the armrests in this direction as well. For example referring to telescoping metal rods may be placed inside the upright supports of the back support so that they are aligned with the lines PQ and WX. The armrests may then be attached to the end of the telescoping metal rods with ball and socket joints. Thus the armrests may be repositioned further away from the chair by moving the telescoping metal rods outwardly along the lines PQ and WX.

According to some embodiments of the invention there may be drink or beverage holders incorporated into the second set of armrests which would allow persons laying belly down on the lounge chair to conveniently access beverage cans and bottles and prevent the beverage cans and bottles from being spilled and or stepped on.

Referring to a lounge chair according to some embodiments of the invention includes an adjustable back support a seat support an adjustable foot leg support two legs four pivots and a support member . The lounge chair also includes a set of armrests including right armrest R and left armrest L. Each of the armrests R and L includes a first rotary joint an armrest base an armrest support a second rotary joint a rest a pivot joint and a third rotary joint .

The first rotary joint rotatably connects the armrest base to the back support . The first rotary joint enables the armrest base to rotate with respect to the back support when the position of the back support is adjusted relative to the seat support . The second rotary joint rotatably connects the armrest support to the seat support . The pivot joint connects the armrest support to the armrest base and allows the armrest support and the armrest base to pivot with respect to each other. The second rotary joint and the pivot joint enable the armrest base to rotate with respect to the seat support when the position of the back support is adjusted relative to the seat support . In other words as the back support is adjusted relative to the seat support the first rotary joint second rotary joint and pivot joint allow the armrest base to maintain a substantially horizontal position as shown in .

The pivot joint and the second rotary joint can include pivot pins. A first one of the pivot pins can penetrate the armrest support and the seat support such that the armrest support can rotate with respect to the seat support . A second one of the pivot pins can penetrate the armrest base and the armrest support such that the armrest support can rotate with respect to the armrest base .

The third rotary joint rotatably connects the rest to the armrest base . The third rotary joint allows the rest to rotate with respect to the armrest base so that the rest can be positioned inwards i.e. across the lap of a person sitting in the chair or outwards away from the person . The rest can include a holder which can be use to hold small items sunglasses beverages and the like. A person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that when a beverage is held in the holder the back support can be adjusted with respect to the seat support without the beverage spilling because the rest is maintained in a substantially horizontal position. The third rotary joint can be any type of joint that will allow movement of the rest with respect to the armrest base . Further the third rotary joint can be a freely moveable or configured to be rigidly or semi rigidly held in various positions.

The back support can also include a head rest . The head rest can be removably attached to the back support by the attachments . The attachments can be for example strings that can be tied around the upper portion of the back support . The head rest can be attached to the back support so as to allow the head rest to rotate from a front side of the back support i.e. to be used as a pillow by a person sitting in the chair to a back side of the back support .

The pivots rotatably connect the legs at both ends of the seat support . The pivots also connect the seat support to each of the back support and the foot leg support . The pivots can include locks that are used to lock the legs into place. The locks can prevent the legs from moving undesirably while a person is arranging themselves in the chair. The legs can also include support beams to provide additional mechanical stability to the legs .

According to some embodiments of the invention the lounge chair includes a set of platforms including a right platform R and a left platform L. Each of the right platform R and the left platform L includes a platform frame a platform support member and at least one chair attachment . The at least one chair attachment may correspond to a platform attachment on the back support of the lounge chair . The platforms can be rotatably attached to the back support such that the platforms can be rotated so as to be substantially in the plane of the back support during use and rotated behind the back support when not in use. A person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that other orientations of the platforms with respect to the back support are also possible.

Referring to when the lounge chair is not in use the chair can be folded into a compact form for storage.

Referring to the chair attachment is disposed on the platform frame . A platform attachment corresponding to the chair attachment can be disposed on the back support of the lounge chair . The chair attachment can include one or more pins and the platform attachment can include holes corresponding to the pins . The pins can engage with the holes to secure the platform into position. For example when a person desires to use the platforms the person can rotate the platforms from behind the back support until the platforms are substantially parallel with the back support . Then the person can engage the pins into the holes to lock the platforms into place. In this way the platforms can support the arms of a person lying in the lounge chair . When a person is not using the platforms the person can rotate the platforms behind the back support and lock the platforms into place. A person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that multiple pins can be provided in each chair attachment so that the platforms can be secured in several different positions.

Although described above as having pins to lock the platforms into position a person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other types of chair attachment locking mechanisms are possible. For example a complementary toothed pivot can be used such that the platforms can be rigidly held in multiple different positions.

In a platform is shown in a first position. In the first position two pins are engaged in two holes such that the platform is rigidly held in position. In the platform is shown in a second position. In the second position the platform has been rotated counter clockwise with respect to the first position and now one pin is engaged with one hole . In the platform is shown in a third position. In the third position the platform has been rotated approximately 180 degrees from the first position. Now the two pins are engaged with two different holes rigidly holding the platform in the third position. Although only shown in three positions a person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that many more positions are possible depending on the positions of the pins and the holes .

According to the embodiments of the invention described above the convenience of lounge pool and patio furniture is increased by providing adjustable armrests that do not require cumbersome adjustments in order to reposition the armrest. According to some embodiments of the invention an additional pair of armrests may be attached to existing conventional chair designs that have only one pair of armrests in order to increase the utility of the chair which may be especially useful for lounge chairs patio furniture chaise lounges and the like.
