This application is a Continuation in Part CIP of U.S. Ser. No. 12 163 335 filed Jun. 27 2008 and claims priority thereto under 35 U.S.C. 120. This application also claims foreign priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 to Japanese patent application 2008 026587 filed Feb. 6 2008. Both U.S. Ser. No. 12 163 335 and Japanese patent application 2008 026587 are incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates to an image forming apparatus such as a copier a facsimile and a printer and more particularly to an image forming apparatus having plural image bearers and using a two component developer including a toner and a carrier and an image forming method using the image forming apparatus.

Image forming apparatuses such as copiers facsimiles and printers equipped with plural image bearers such as photoreceptors for the purpose of forming color images are known. Such image forming apparatuses use a direct transfer method of directly multi transferring toner images formed by the plural image bearers onto a sheet such as a paper and fixing the toner images thereon upon application of heat etc. and an intermediate transfer method of multi transferring toner images onto an intermediate transferer transferring them onto a sheet and fixing them thereon. The intermediate transfer method is in other words an indirect transfer method.

For example a full color image forming apparatus using an intermediate transfer method is equipped with a first transferer transferring a toner image on an image bearer onto an intermediate transferer a second transferer transferring the toner image on the intermediate transferer onto a sheet a first cleaner cleaning a toner remaining on the image bearer after the toner image is transferred onto the intermediate transferer and a second cleaner cleaning a toner remaining on the intermediate transferer after the toner image is transferred onto the sheet. These cleaners are typically equipped with a cleaning blade scraping the toner remaining on the image bearer and the intermediate transferer.

A two component developer including a toner and a carrier is well known as a developer forming images. In an image forming apparatus using the two component developer a toner in the developer is borne by the image bearer to form a toner image the toner image is transferred onto a sheet such as a paper and the toner image fixed thereon upon receipt of a heat energy etc.

A toner used for developing an electrostatic latent image is typically a colored particle formed of a binder resin including a colorant a charge controlling agent and other additives and is broadly classified into a pulverized toner and a chemical toner.

A toner having a smaller particle diameter produces images having higher definition and quality. The pulverized toner prepared by conventional kneading and pulverizing methods having an amorphous shape produces images having poor granularity and sharpness. In addition having poor fluidity as a powder due to the shape the pulverized toner needs a large amount of a fluidizer and has a low filling rate in a toner bottle which prevents the apparatus from being downsized. Further the pulverized toner has a minimum particle size larger than that of the chemical toner.

Further in a full color image forming apparatus having a complicated transfer process i.e. a toner image is transferred from an image bearer to an intermediate transferer and to a sheet therefrom the pulverized toner having poor transferability due to the amorphous shape causes images having blank spots and a large consumption thereof to cover the poor transferability.

In order to solve the problems of the amorphous toner various methods of preparing spheric chemical toners are developed.

The method of preparing chemical toners include suspension polymerization methods and emulsion polymerization condensation methods. Japanese published unexamined application No. 7 152202 discloses a polymer solution suspension method. This is a method of dispersing or dissolving toner materials in a volatile solvent such as an organic solvent having a low boiling point to prepare a dispersion or a solution emulsifying and dripping the dispersion or solution in an aqueous medium with the presence of a dispersant and removing the volatile solvent.

Japanese published unexamined application No. 11 149179 discloses a method of using a low molecular weight resin in the polymer solution suspension method to decrease the viscosity of the dispersion. Therefore the dispersibility and emulsification of the toner materials improve and further the fixability of the resultant toner improves because the toner materials were subjected to a polymerization reaction in a particle.

Differently from the suspension polymerization methods and emulsion polymerization condensation methods these methods can use general purpose resins. Particularly a polyester resin having good low temperature fixability and effectively used for full color processes needing transparency and image smoothness after fixed can be used. These methods are particularly called ester elongation polymerization methods.

However a spherical toner having a small particle diameter has very poor cleanability. In addition having good transferability the spherical toners having smaller particle diameters adhere more to a photoreceptor resulting in deterioration of the transferability.

Japanese published unexamined application No. 3 100661 discloses adding a medium size inorganic particulate material having an average particle diameter of from 20 to 40 nm to an external additive in order to improve cleanability and transferability. Japanese Patents Nos. 3328013 and 3056122 and Japanese published unexamined application No. 9 319134 disclose using a large size inorganic particulate material having an average particle diameter not less than 100 nm as an external additive to assure cleanability and to prevent other small size additives from being buried by a stress in an image developer.

However these initially have good cleanability and transferability but the external additives are buried as time passes.

Recent demands for saving resources and electrical power require reduction of energy for fixing a toner and therefore a toner being a resin powder is having a lower softening point. A toner having a lower softening point preferably includes comparatively a soft resin such as a polyester resin as a binder resin forming the toner.

It is difficult to maintain good cleanability and transferability even by the arts disclosed in Japanese published unexamined applications Nos. 3 100661 and 9 319134 and in Japanese Patents Nos. 3328013 and 3056122 because the polyester resins has a mechanical strength lower than those of other resins. Therefore an image forming apparatus producing high resolution and high quality images for long periods even with a toner including a polyester resin having good low temperature fixability and in which an external additive is likely to be buried.

Meanwhile a toner image is required to faithfully and stably transferred from an image bearer onto an intermediate transferer and from the intermediate transferer onto a sheet.

Therefore a full color image forming apparatus using the intermediate transferer occasionally has a pressurizer pressing the intermediate transferer to the image bearer. The pressurizer pressurizes between the image bearer and the intermediate transferer to increase transfer efficiency and prevent defective transfers such as hollow images. The pressurizer also prevents the intermediate transferer from waving and evenly contacts the intermediate transferer to the surface of the image bearer to prevent uneven transferer.

However when a pressure is applied between the image bearer and the intermediate transferer a stress is concentrated on a part of a toner image thereon resulting in occasional defective transfers i.e. the centers of toner images particularly line images and letter images on the intermediate transferer drop out.

In order to prevent such defective transfers Japanese published unexamined applications Nos. 2003 098770 2000 162899 and 2000 155476 disclose methods of fixing a contact pressure of a first transferer to an image bearer in a specific range so as not to apply a pressure more than predetermined to a toner image.

However the most suitable pressure depends on an adherence amount of atoner e.g. monochrome or multicolor layered images. When the pressure is less or more than the most suitable pressure the defective transfers cannot be sufficiently improved or even worsen.

In order to solve this problem Japanese published unexamined applications Nos. 2002 014515 and 2005 024936 disclose methods of lowering the contact pressure to the downstream transfer site than that to the upstream transfer site or differentiating the contact pressures to a black transfer site and the most upstream transfer site. Japanese published unexamined application No. 2006 301673 discloses a method of contacting a transfer unit including an intermediate transferer to an image bearer under its own weight to stably contact the transfer unit thereto.

However controlling the pressure of a first transferer to an image bearer influences not only upon defective transfers but also on performance of a second transfer. When a sheet is a paper having low smoothness the transferability of a toner differs due to concavities and convexities on the surface of the paper resulting in scabrous or grainy images. Particularly in an image forming apparatus using a two component developer including a soft toner the pressure of the first transferer needs considerate adjustment in consideration of the influence upon the second transfer.

Because of these reasons a need exists for an image forming apparatus smoothly transferring toner images even from plural image bearers using a two component developer including comparatively a soft toner and a carrier.

Accordingly an object of the present invention is to provide an image forming apparatus such as copiers facsimiles and printers smoothly transferring toner images even from plural image bearers using a two component developer including comparatively a soft toner and a carrier.

Another object of the present invention is to provide an image forming method using the image forming apparatus.

These objects and other objects of the present invention either individually or collectively have been satisfied by the discovery of an image forming apparatus comprising 

plural image bearers configured bear toner images comprising a black toner image which are developed with a two component developer comprising a carrier and a toner comprising a binder resin and an additive 

plural pressers each configured to press the receptor to each of the plural image bearers at a predetermined pressure wherein the additive has a burial rate X indicated by the following formula not less than 40 100 wherein A represents a BET specific surface area cm g of the toner and B represents a BET specific surface area cm g of the toner after buried and

wherein one of the pressers pressing the receptor to the image bearer bearing the black toner image presses the receptor thereto at a pressure lower than those of the other pressers.

These and other objects features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon consideration of the following description of the preferred embodiments of the present invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The present invention provides an image forming apparatus such as copiers facsimiles and printers smoothly transferring toner images even from plural image bearers using a two component developer including comparatively a soft toner and a carrier.

plural image bearers configured bear toner images comprising a black toner image which are developed with a two component developer comprising a carrier and a toner comprising a binder resin and an additive 

plural pressers each configured to press the receptor to each of the plural image bearers at a predetermined pressure 

wherein the additive has a burial rate X indicated by the following formula not less than 40 100 wherein A represents a BET specific surface area cm g of the toner and B represents a BET specific surface area cm g of the toner after buried and

wherein one of the pressers pressing the receptor to the image bearer bearing the black toner image presses the receptor thereto at a pressure lower than those of the other pressers.

The image forming apparatus is capable of smoothly transferring toner images using a two component developer including comparatively a soft toner and a carrier producing quality images and maintaining fixability even when lowering a fixable temperature to save energy.

The presser has a pressing member contacting the receptor to vertically press the receptor to the image bearer. The pressing member does not have to press the receptor to the image bearer against gravitational force and can uniformly press the receptor thereto to prevent defective transfers and can lower the pressure.

When the pressing member has an ASKER C hardness of 50 or less the pressing member is squashy and an area contacting the receptor becomes large and can uniformly press the receptor to the image bearer to prevent defective transfers and can lower the pressure.

The receptor is an intermediate transferer and the image forming apparatus has a first transferer well transferring a toner image from the image bearer onto the intermediate transferer and a second transferer well transferring the toner image thereon onto a sheet.

When a black toner image is transferred onto the intermediate transferer from the image bearer last the first and second transfers can be performed well and quality images can be produced because a black image is distinct and is seldom overlapped with other colors.

When a yellow toner image is transferred onto the intermediate transferer from the image bearer first the first and second transfers can be performed well and quality images can be produced because a yellow image is indistinctive.

When a magenta toner image and a cyan toner image are transferred onto the intermediate transferer from the image bearers secondly and thirdly in this order the first and second transfers can be performed well and quality images can be produced because they are indistinctive in this order.

When the binder resin is a polyester resin the image forming apparatus is capable of smoothly transferring toner images using a two component developer including comparatively a soft toner including the polyester resin and a carrier producing quality images and maintaining fixability even when lowering a fixable temperature to save energy.

The image forming apparatus is capable of forming images on any sheet shaped recoding media such as OHP sheets cards postcards and envelopes besides plain papers for copy use. The image forming apparatus is also capable of forming images on both sides of the sheet shaped recoding media.

The image forming apparatus includes a main body a reader located above the main body as a scanner reading originals an automatic document feeder ADF loading the originals and feeding them to the reader and a sheet feeder located below the main body as a paper feed table loading sheets fed between photoreceptor drums Y M C and BK and an intermediate transfer belt .

The image forming apparatus is a tandem type image forming apparatus including the photoreceptor drums Y M C and BK as plural image bearers capable of separately forming a yellow image a magenta image a cyan image and a black image. The photoreceptor drums Y M C and BK have a same diameter and are placed at even intervals on an outer circumferential side i.e. an image forming side of the endless intermediate transfer belt located at almost the inner center of the main body as an intermediate transferer a receptor .

The intermediate transfer belt is rotatable in the direction indicated by an arrow A facing the photoreceptor drums Y M C and BK. A visible image i.e. a toner image formed on each of the photoreceptor drums Y M C and BK is respectively transferred onto the intermediate transfer belt rotating in the direction indicated by an arrow A to be overlapped thereon and then the overlapped images are transferred onto a sheet at a time. The image forming apparatus uses an intermediate transfer method in other words an indirect transfer method.

First transfer rollers Y M C and BK as first transfer chargers located facing the photoreceptor drums Y M C and BK across the intermediate transfer belt apply voltages thereto with timing adjustment of the voltage application from upstream to downstream of the direction A such that toner images formed on the photoreceptor drums Y M C and BK are transferred onto a same position of the intermediate transfer belt to be overlapped thereon while rotating in the direction A.

Methods and materials for preparing the intermediate transfer belt are not particularly limited however a polyimide resin is preferably used in terms of strength.

The intermediate transfer belt formed of a polyimide resin is preferably prepared by the following method.

Carbon black is dispersed in a polyamic acid solution to prepare a dispersion the dispersion is poured into a metallic drum and dried s peeled film centrifugally formed from the metallic drum rotating is elongated under high temperature of from 100 to 200 C. to form a polyimide film and the film is properly cut to form an endless belt formed of a polyimide resin.

An iron core is covered with the half hardened film and the film is further hardened at 300 to 450 C. to prepare the intermediate transfer belt .

The properties of the intermediate transfer belt can be controlled with the carbon quantity calcination temperature hardening speed etc. These can also control the volume resistivity and surface resistivity.

The volume resistivity and surface resistivity mentioned later are measured by a resistance meter HIRESTER UP MCP HT450 from Mitsubishi Chemical Corp. using a probe MCP HTP14 therefore.

The photoreceptor drums Y M C and BK are located in this order in line from the upstream of the direction A. They are installed in image forming stations Y M C and BK for forming yellow magenta cyan and black images respectively.

The image forming apparatus has an image forming unit including the four image forming stations Y M C and BK a transfer belt unit as an intermediate transfer unit including the intermediate transfer belt below the photoreceptor drums Y M C and BK facing them a second transfer roller as a second transferer contacting the intermediate transfer belt and rotating in the same direction thereof at the contact point to transfer a toner image thereon onto a sheet a sheet transporter transporting the sheet onto which the toner image on the intermediate transfer belt is transferred by the second transfer roller and an intermediate transfer belt cleaner located facing the intermediate transfer belt to clean the intermediate transfer belt after the toner image is transferred onto the sheet.

The image forming apparatus also has an optical scanner located above the image forming stations Y M C and BK facing them as an irradiator writing with light a pair of register rollers placing a sheet fed from the sheet feeder between the intermediate transfer belt and the second transfer roller at a predetermined timing of forming toner images in the image forming stations Y M C and BK and a sensor not shown detecting an end of the sheet at the pair of register rollers .

Further the image forming apparatus has a fixer as a belt fixing unit fixing the toner image on the sheet transported therein by the sheet transporter a paper discharging unit including a paper discharging path discharging the sheet out of the main body and a reverse path transporting the sheet to the pair of register rollers again to transport the sheet to either path and a both side printing unit switching back the sheet to reverse when the paper discharging unit transports the sheet having an image on one side to the reverse path.

Furthermore the image forming apparatus has a discharged paper tray located out of the main body loading the sheet images are formed on a manual paper feeder located on the right side of the main body in an operation panel not shown operating the image forming apparatus and a controller not shown controlling all performances thereof.

Besides the intermediate transfer belt the transfer belt unit has first transfer rollers Y M C and BK a drive roller hanging the intermediate transfer belt a transfer entrance roller a tension roller and a drive unit not shown .

The transfer belt unit rotates the drive roller anticlockwise in with the drive unit to set the photoreceptor drums Y M and C apart from the intermediate transfer belt keeping the photoreceptor drum BK contacting thereto.

When a monochrome black image is formed the photoreceptor drums Y M and C are set apart from the intermediate transfer belt . The controller activates the drive unit.

Since the image forming apparatus has the intermediate transfer belt cleaner the photoreceptor drums Y M and C need not be set apart from the intermediate transfer belt because a black toner remaining thereon does not contaminate them. However the photoreceptor drums Y M and C are set apart from the intermediate transfer belt when a monochrome black image is formed in case even the intermediate transfer belt cleaner does not completely remove the remaining toner for some reason. The black toner is so visible that the resultant images deteriorate when adhering to the photoreceptor drums Y M and C.

The photoreceptor drum BK forming a black image is located downstream side of the photoreceptor drums Y M and C in the direction A. This is because it is most preferable that the photoreceptor drum BK is located at the most downstream position in the direction A and transfer a black toner image last onto the intermediate transfer belt to prevent a black toner from adhering to the photoreceptor drums Y M and C therethrough when the photoreceptor drums Y M C and BK contact the intermediate transfer belt to form a full color image.

The pair of register rollers are earthed. This is because a paper powder is generally difficult to move to the photoreceptor drums Y M C and BK in the image forming apparatus using the intermediate transfer method and a paper powder transfer need not be considered.

However a bias may be applied to the pair of register rollers to remove the paper powder. When the pair of register rollers are formed of rollers having a diameter of 18 mm coated with an electroconductive NBR rubber having a thickness of 1 mm and a volume resistivity about 10 cm a voltage about 800 V is applied to the roller contacting the surface side of a sheet a toner is transferred onto and a voltage about 200 V is applied to the roller contacting the backside of the sheet.

A DC bias is typically applied thereto and an AC voltage including a DC offset element can be applied thereto to more uniformly charge a sheet.

The sheet surface is negatively charged slightly after passing the pair of register rollers and therefore the transfer conditions are occasionally changed from those when the pair of register rollers are not applied with a voltage.

The sheet transporter has an endless transport belt and a derive roller and a driven roller hanging the transport belt .

The second transfer roller facing the transfer entrance roller contacts the intermediate transfer belt with pressure between the transfer entrance roller and the intermediate transfer belt .

The second transfer roller may have a non contact charger or a transfer transport unit combined with the driven roller of the sheet transporter transporting the sheet to the fixer shown as in .

The optical scanner has a light emitting source not shown irradiating the surfaces of the photoreceptor drums Y M C and BK with a laser beam not shown based on an image signal to form an electrostatic latent image thereon a polygon mirror not shown rotating to reflect the laser beam a polygon motor not shown and many optical elements forming an electrostatic latent image on the photoreceptor drums Y M C and BK. The laser beam is irradiated to the photoreceptor drums Y M C and BK in the vertical direction of the sheet in .

The fixer has a heat roller and a fixing roller hanging a fixing belt and a pressure roller contacting the fixing belt with pressure between the fixing roller and the fixing belt . A sheet bearing a toner image passes through a contact point with pressure between the fixing belt and the pressure roller such that the toner image is fixed on the surface of the sheet with heat and pressure.

The paper discharging unit has a transport roller transporting the sheet a toner image is fixed on to the both side printing unit a paper discharging roller discharging the sheet out of the main body and a switcher leading the sheet a toner image is fixed on to the paper discharging path having the paper discharging roller to discharge the sheet out of the main body or the reverse path having the transport roller to let the sheet into the both side printing unit .

The both side printing unit has a tray once loading the sheet transported from the paper discharging unit on one side of which an image is formed a reverse roller switching back the sheet on the tray and a paper feed roller feeding the sheet switched back by the reverse roller toward the register roller .

The sheet feeder has a paper bank having a paper feeding cassette loading a number of sheets a feed roller contacting the upper surface of the sheet at the top the sheets loaded in the paper feeding cassette a separation roller separating the sheets one by one run out by the feed roller a transport roller transporting the sheet sent out from the feed roller and the separation roller toward the register roller and a paper feeding path the sheet transported by the transport roller passes through. The paper feeding path is so formed as to continue in the main body from the sheet feeder and a paper feeding path in the main body also has a transport roller .

The feed roller is driven to rotate anticlockwise in and the separation roller operates to lead a sheet on the top into the paper feeding path and the transport roller rotates to transport the sheet toward the register roller until the sheet stops thereat.

The manual paper feeder has a manual tray loading sheets a feed roller contacting the upper surface of a sheet on the top of the sheets loaded on the manual tray a separation roller separating the sheets one by one run out by the feed roller and a paper sensor detecting a sheet loaded on the manual tray .

The feed roller is driven to rotate clockwise in and the separation roller operates to lead a sheet on the top into the paper feeding path of the main body and transport the sheet toward the register roller until the sheet stops thereat.

The reader has a contact glass a document is placed on a light source not shown irradiating the document placed on the contact glass a first scanner scanning from side to side in including a first reflector not shown reflecting light reflected from the document irradiated by the light source a second scanner including a second reflector not shown reflecting light reflected from a reflector of the first scanner an imaging lens imaging light from the second scanner and a reading sensor receiving light through the imaging lens to read the document.

The automatic document feeder ADF has a document table a document is placed on which is turnable to the reader and exposes the contact glass when turning above. When a copy is made using the image forming apparatus a document is set on the document table of the automatic document feeder ADF or a document is manually placed on the contact glass after turning the automatic document feeder ADF above and it is closed to press the document to the contact glass

The operation panel has a start button starting copying a ten key keypad to input the number of copies a mode selection key selecting image forming modes such as a selection of a full color image or a black monochrome image etc.

The image forming station Y including the photoreceptor drum Y will be explained as a representative of the image forming stations Y M C and BK. Details of the other image forming stations M C and BK are omitted because they are substantially the same as those of the image forming station Y.

As shown in the image forming station Y including the photoreceptor drum Y has a first transfer roller Y contacting an intermediate transfer belt a presser Y including the first transfer roller Y and pressing the intermediate transfer belt to the photoreceptor drum Y at a predetermined pressure a cleaner Y a charger Y an image developer Y and a discharger not shown around the photoreceptor drum Y along an anticlockwise rotating direction BLS thereof in The photoreceptor drum Y the cleaner Y the charger Y the image developer Y and the discharger are combined to form a process cartridge Y. The process cartridge Y can be drawn from and set in detachable from a main body along a guide rail not shown .

The process cartridge Y is positioned in a predetermined location when set in the main body . The process cartridge is preferably used because it can be handled as an exchangeable part noticeably improving its maintenance.

At least the photoreceptor drum Y and the image developer Y out of the photo receptor drum Y the cleaner Y the charger Y the image developer Y and the discharger are combined to form the process cartridge Y which is a unit detachable from the main body .

The charger Y has a charging roller Y driven to rotate while contacting the surface of the photoreceptor drum Y and a cleaning roller Y driven to rotate while contacting the charging roller Y. A voltage applicator not shown applying a DC voltage overlapped with an AC voltage is connected to the charging roller Y and discharges and charges the surface of photoreceptor drum Y to have a predetermined polarity in a charging area facing the photoreceptor drum Y. The cleaning roller Y is driven by the charging roller Y to rotate and clean the charging roller Y.

In this embodiment a contact charging roller is used in the charger. However a close set charging roller or a non contact scorotron charging roller may be used.

The first transfer roller Y contacts the intermediate transfer belt to press it to the photoreceptor drum Y. The first transfer roller Y has an axis Y which is rotatably supported by the main body and a rotation center thereof. The first transfer roller Y has a metallic cored bar not shown and an elastic layer not shown covering the outer circumferential surface of the cored bar and the metallic cored bar has the axis Y. The first transfer roller Y has an ASKER C hardness not greater than with the elastic layer. A bias applicator having an electric source not shown and a bias controller not shown apply a predetermined bias to the first transfer roller Y. The axis Y extends in a direction perpendicular to the drawing i.e. a main scanning direction which is an axial direction of the first transfer roller Y.

Besides the first transfer roller Y the presser Y has a press spring Y as a biasing means biasing the axis Y toward the intermediate transfer belt between the axis Y and the main body and a holder not shown displaceably holding the axis Y in the vertical direction. The presser Y presses the intermediate transfer belt to the photoreceptor drum Y vertically and upward with a biasing force through the first transfer roller Y. The pressure at which the press spring Y presses the intermediate transfer belt to the photoreceptor drum Y will be mentioned later as a first transfer pressure in .

The optical scanner in irradiates an area between a charged area and a developing area of the photoreceptor drum Y with a laser beam L optically modulated according to image information in such that the surface of the photoreceptor drum Y after charged by the charging roller Y is exposed with the laser beam L to form an electrostatic latent image to be visualized developed by the image developer Y as a yellow toner image.

The cleaner Y has a cleaning case Y having an opening facing the photoreceptor drum Y a rotating brush roller Y contacting the photoreceptor drum Y to scrape a toner a carrier and a paper powder remaining thereon a cleaning blade Y contacting the photoreceptor drum Y at a downstream position in a rotating direction B thereof to scrape undesired substances thereon.

The cleaner Y also has a discharge screw Y rotatably held by the cleaning case Y forming a part of a waste toner path not shown for transporting undesired substances such as a waste toner scraped and removed by the rotating brush roller Y and the cleaning blade Y.

The image developer Y has a developer case Y having an opening facing the photoreceptor drum Y a developing roller Y as a developer bearer closely facing the photoreceptor drum Y from the opening and a developer doctor blade Y as a regulator regulating the height of the developer on the developing roller Y.

The image developer Y also has a first feed screw Y and a second feed screw Y facing each other at the bottom of the developer case Y and being rotated in the reverse direction each other to stir the developer and feed the developer to the developing roller Y a partition Y between the first feed screw Y and the second feed screw Y and a first container Y and a second container Y containing the developer partitioned by the partition Y including the first feed screw Y and the second feed screw Y.

Further the image developer Y has a toner hopper Y storing a yellow toner a toner concentration sensor Y located at the bottom of the second container Y detecting toner concentration in the developer a double sided tape Y taping the toner concentration sensor Y to the second container Y.

Furthermore the image developer Y has a bias applicator not shown applying a DC developing bias a driver not shown driving the developing roller Y a feed driver not shown rotating the first feed screw Y and the second feed screw Y in the reverse direction each other and a toner feeder not shown feeding the toner from the toner hopper Y to the second container Y.

The developing roller Y has a magnet roller Y generating a magnetic field and a developing sleeve Y including the magnet roller Y and being rotated in the clockwise direction C by a developing driver in .

The magnet roller Y has a plastic roller not shown fixed on the developer case Y and plural magnet blocks not shown buried in the plastic roller forming plural magnetic poles.

A suitable developing bias is applied by a bias applicator between the developing sleeve Y and the photoreceptor drum Y. A developing gap between the developing sleeve Y and the photoreceptor drum Y in a developing area is designed to be 0.3 0.05 mm.

The developer doctor blade Y is formed of a SUS material. A doctor gap between the developing sleeve Y and the developer doctor blade Y is designed to be 0.5 0.04 mm.

The carrier is a magnetic carrier including a core material and a resin coated layer formed on the surface of the core material. The resin coated layer includes an electroconductive particulate material formed of a substrate a tin dioxide layer on the substrate and an indium oxide layer including tin dioxide on the tin dioxide layer.

The toner concentration in the developer is constantly controlled to have about 4 to 11 by weight based on total weight of the developer to the weight of the carrier based on the detection of the toner concentration sensor Y as mentioned later which produce high quality images. The toner concentration lowers as the toner is consumed and when the toner concentration sensor Y detects the toner concentration is lower than the minimum the toner is fed from the toner hopper Y to the second container Y by the toner feeder.

The first feed screw Y and the second feed screw Y extend in the width direction of the developing roller Y in other words in the longitudinal direction thereof perpendicular to the drawing in .

The first feed screw Y is rotated by the feed driver to feed the developer in the first container Y to the developing roller Y while transporting the developer from behind to the front in . The developer transported by the first feed screw Y near the end of the first container Y enters the second container Y through an opening not shown on the partition Y.

The second feed screw Y is rotated by the feed driver in the second container Y to transport the developer transported from the first container Y in the reverse direction of the first feed screw Y. When the toner is fed into the second feed screw Y from the toner hopper Y the second feed screw Y transports the developer while stirring and mixing the toner in the developer. The developer transported by the first feed screw Y near the end of the first container Y returns into the second container Y through another opening not shown on the partition Y.

The toner is stirred and mixed with the developer by the first feed screw Y and the second feed screw Y to be charged and borne by the developing roller Y.

The developing roller Y bearing the developer having an amount and a thickness regulated by the developer doctor blade Y transports the developer with its rotation and a developing bias from the bias applicator to a developing area between the developing roller Y and the photoreceptor drum Y. A yellow toner in the developer is electrostatically transferred to an electrostatic latent image formed on the photoreceptor drum Y to visualize the electrostatic latent image as a yellow toner image.

The developer having transferred the yellow toner for developing is returned into the image developer Y with the rotation of the developing roller Y.

In this embodiment the bias applicator applies a DC developing bias. The developing bias may be an AC bias and a DC bias may be overlapped with an AC bias.

Thus the developer stirred and transported by the first feed screw Y and the second feed screw Y in the image developer Y is drawn by the magnetic force of the magnet roller Y borne by the developing sleeve Y transported the developing area facing the photoreceptor drum Y and a toner is fed to a latent image thereon. The developer having transferred the toner after development is freed in the first container Y from the surface of the developing sleeve Y stirred with the developers in the first container Y and the second container Y by the first feed screw Y and the second feed screw Y respectively to be drawn to the surface of the developing sleeve Y again. The magnet block is located to repeat such a cycle.

In such a cycle the toner in the developer is consumed and the concentration thereof lowers. The toner concentration is detected by the toner concentration sensor Y.

The toner concentration sensor Y measures the toner concentration by weight with a magnetic permeability of the developer producing a voltage Vout to be put in a controller.

A developer including a toner and a magnetic carrier has a high magnetic permeability when the toner concentration is low because a ratio of the carrier increases. The magnetic permeability becomes low when the toner concentration is high because the ratio of the carrier lowers. Therefore the toner concentration and the voltage Vout are in direct proportion to each other.

When the controller detects lowering the toner concentration based on the voltage Vout from the toner concentration sensor Y the controller drives the toner feeder to feed the toner from the toner hopper Y to the second container Y until the voltage Vout recovers to have a predetermined value.

When a copy is made using the image forming apparatus a start button is pushed while setting a document on the automatic document feeder ADF as mentioned above or manually placing a document on the contact glass . When the image forming apparatus is used as a printer image data are selected and input by outer input devices such as a PC connected thereto to start producing images.

When a document is set on the automatic document feeder ADF the document is fed onto the contact glass to be read by the reader . When a document is placed on the contact glass a start button is pushed such that the reader reads the document to produce image data.

When the document is read the first scanner and the second scanner scan the document is irradiated with light from the light source the first reflector reflects light reflected from the document toward the second scanner the second reflector turns the direction of the light by 180 degrees toward the reading sensor through the imaging lens and the document is read by the reading sensor

The above mentioned image forming stations Y M C and BK operate based on image data produced or input.

In the image forming station Y the surface of the photoreceptor drum Y is uniformly charged by the charging roller Y with the rotation in the direction B. The optical scanner irradiates the photoreceptor drum Y with a laser beam L to form an electrostatic latent image for yellow color thereon. The electrostatic latent image is developed by the image developer Y with a yellow color toner to form a yellow color toner image. The yellow color toner image is first transferred by the first transfer roller Y onto the intermediate transfer belt traveling in the direction A. Undesired substances including a toner remaining on the photoreceptor drum Y after transferred are removed by the cleaner Y and the photoreceptor drum Y is discharged.

Each color toner image is formed on each of other photoreceptors C M and BK and each color toner image is first transferred by each of the first transfer rollers C M and Bk respectively on the same position of the intermediate transfer belt traveling in the direction A to from a fill color toner image. The toner images overlapped on the intermediate transfer belt are transported to a second transfer nip facing the second transfer roller with the rotation thereof in the direction A to be secondly transferred onto a sheet.

The sheet fed between the intermediate transfer belt and the second transfer roller is a sheet fed from the paper feeding cassette by the rotation of the selected feed roller which is one of the sheet feeder a sheet fed by the rotation of the feed roller of the manual paper feeder from the manual tray or a sheet fed by the paper feed roller from the both side printing unit . The sheet is fed by the pair of register rollers such that the end of a toner image on the intermediate transfer belt faces the second transfer roller based on a detection signal of the sensor.

The sheet all color toner images are transferred on and bearing them is transported by the transporter to enter the fixer where the toner images borne by the sheet are fixed thereon with heat and pressure when passing a fixing area between the fixing belt and the pressure roller to form a color image thereon.

The sheet the toner images are fixed on is stacked on the discharged paper tray through the paper discharging roller or enters the both side printing unit through the transport roller to be ready to be printed on the other side in accordance with a position of the switcher . On the other hand a toner remaining on the intermediate transfer belt after the second transfer is removed therefrom by the intermediate transfer belt cleaner and the intermediate transfer belt is ready to form a following image.

The toner included in the two component developer for use in the image forming apparatus will be explained.

The toner is not particularly limited and toners prepared by conventional known methods can be used provided they satisfy the requirements of the present invention. In addition conventional known binder resins and colorants can be used for the toner provided they satisfy the requirements thereof.

Specific examples of the binder resins include polyester resins styrene resins acrylic resins styrene acrylic resins polyol resins epoxy resins etc. Particularly the polyester resins are preferably used in terms of their low temperature fixability. The binder resin preferably has a glass transition temperature Tg of from 40 to 75 C. and more preferably from 45 to 65 C. When Tg is too low the heat resistant preservability of the resultant toner deteriorates. When too high the low temperature fixability of the resultant toner deteriorates. Tg can be determined from a DSC curve obtained at a rate of temperature increase of 10 C. min using a differential scanning calorimeter DSC DSC 60A from Shimadzu Corp.

Specific examples of the colorants for use in the present invention include any known dyes and pigments such as carbon black Nigrosine dyes NAPHTHOL YELLOW HANSA YELLOW polyazo yellow Oil Yellow Pigment Yellow PERMANENT YELLOW Brilliant Carmine PERMANENT RED Oil Red Quinacridone Red Pyrazolone Red polyazo red Phthalocyanine Blue Anthraquinone Blue Anthraquinone Violet Naphthol Green Phthalocyanine Green etc. The toner preferably include the colorant in an amount of from 0.5 to 15 by weight and more preferably from 3 to 10 by weight. The colorant for use in the present invention can be used as a masterbatch when combined with a resin. The resin used for preparing the masterbatch is typically the same as the binder resin of the toner but not particularly limited.

The toner may include a release agent together with the binder resin and the colorant. Specific examples thereof include known release agents such as polyethylene wax polypropylene wax paraffin wax sasol wax carnauba wax montan wax etc. The toner preferably includes a release agent in an amount of from 0 to 40 by weight and more preferably from 5 to 20 by weight.

Further the toner may include a charge controlling agent if desired. Specific examples thereof include any known charge controlling agents such as Nigrosine dyes triphenylmethane dyes metal complex dyes including chromium molybdic acid chelate pigments quaternary ammonium salts fluorine modified quaternary ammonium salts and metal salts of salicylic acid and of salicylic acid derivatives etc.

The content of the charge controlling agent is determined depending on the species of the binder resin used whether or not an additive is added and toner manufacturing method such as dispersion method used and is not particularly limited. However the toner preferably includes the charge controlling agent in an amount of from 0.1 to 10 by weight and more preferably from 0.2 to 5 by weight. The charge controlling agent may be dispersed in a toner externally added to the surface thereof or fixed thereon.

Further optional inorganic particulate materials may be externally added to the toner for the purpose of the fluidity developability and chargeability thereof. The inorganic particulate material preferably has a primary particle diameter of from 5 nm to 2 m and is preferably included in the toner in an amount of from 0.01 to 5 by weight based on total weight thereof. Specific examples of the inorganic particulate material include silica alumina titanium oxide barium titanate magnesium titanate calcium titanate strontium titanate zinc oxide tin oxide quartz sand clay mica sand lime diatom earth chromium oxide cerium oxide red iron oxide antimony trioxide magnesium oxide zirconium oxide barium sulfate barium carbonate calcium carbonate silicon carbide silicon nitride etc. These can be used alone or in combination.

A toner including a polyester resin prepared by an ester elongation polymerization method having good low temperature fixability as a binder resin is most preferably used in the image forming apparatus .

This is because as mentioned previously the recent demand for saving resources and energy is so strong that a toner formed of a resin powder is having a lower softening point to be fixed with a lower energy.

The ester elongation polymerization method is a method of preparing a toner including dispersing an organic solvent phase including a polyester prepolymer in an aqueous medium phase with a compound including an active hydrogen to be subjected to an elongation and or a crosslinking reaction removing the organic solvent and washing and drying. This method has good granulatability and can control the particle diameter the particle diameter distribution and the shape of a toner with ease. Hereinafter the above mentioned method and materials used therein will be explained.

The polyester prepolymer is a component forming a more polymeric toner binder when subjected to an elongation and or a crosslinking reaction with the compound including an active hydrogen in the aqueous medium. The polyester prepolymers include a polyester prepolymer having a functional group such as an isocyanate group reacting with an active hydrogen etc.

The polyester prepolymer having an isocyanate group is preferably used. The polyester prepolymer can be formed from a reaction between polyester which is a polycondensate between polyol PO and a polycarboxylic acid PC and has an active hydrogen atom and polyisocyanate PIC . Specific examples of the polycondensate between polyol PO and a polycarboxylic acid PC having an active hydrogen atom include adducts of bisphenol A with alkylene oxide dicarboxylic acids such as a succinic acid an adipic acid a maleic acid a fumaric acid a phthalic acid and a terephthalic acid and polycarboxylic acids such as a trimellitic acid and a pyromellitic acid.

Specific examples of the PIC include aliphatic polyisocyanate such as tetramethylenediisocyanate hexamethylenediisocyanate and 2 6 diisocyanatemethylcaproate alicyclic polyisocyanate such as isophoronediisocyanate and cyclohexylmethanediisocyanate aromatic diisocyanate such as tolylenedisocyanate and diphenylmethanediisocyanate aroma aliphatic diisocyanate such as tetramethylxylylenediisocyanate isocyanurate the above mentioned polyisocyanate blocked with phenol derivatives oxime and caprolactam and their combinations.

The polyester prepolymer typically includes one or more preferably from 1.5 to 3 and more preferably from 1.8 to 2.5 isocyanate groups per molecule. When less than 1 the molecular weight of the polyester lowers after the elongation reaction and the hot offset resistance of the resultant toner deteriorates. The polyester prepolymer is dissolved in an organic solvent phase as mentioned above and the content thereof is from 10 to 55 by weight preferably from 10 to 40 by weight and more preferably from 15 to 30 by weight per 100 by weight of the toner.

An unreactive polyester is more preferably dissolved with the polyester prepolymer than only the polyester prepolymer is dissolved in the organic solvent phase to improve the low temperature fixability and glossiness of the resultant toner when used for forming full color images.

Specific examples of the unreactive polyester include the above mentioned polycondensates between polyol PO and a polycarboxylic acid PC .

A ratio PP UP of the polyester prepolymer PP to the unreactive polyester UP which are dissolved in an organic solvent phase is from 10 90 to 55 45 preferably from 10 90 to 40 60 and furthermore preferably from 15 85 to 30 70 by weight. When the ratio of the polyester prepolymer is too low the hot offset resistance of the resultant toner deteriorates and the heat resistant preservability and low temperature fixability are difficult to be compatible. Other known toner binder resins except the unreactive polyester such as a styrene resin an acrylic resin an epoxy resin and a styrene acrylic acid ester copolymer may be used.

Amines are preferably used as the compound including an active hydrogen and are reacted with the isocyanate group of the polyester prepolymer to formurea modified polyester resins. Specific examples of the amines include diamines polyamines having three or more amino groups amino alcohols amino mercaptans amino acids and blocked amines in which the amines mentioned above are blocked. 4 4 diaminodiphenyl methane isophorone diamine hexamethylene diamine ethanol amine aminoethyl mercaptan amino propionic acid and ketimine compounds which are prepared by blocking the amines with ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone preferably used.

It is most preferable that the colorant or the masterbatch is previously dissolved or dispersed with the polyester prepolymer and the unreactive polyester in an organic solvent phase. In addition the release agent and the charge controlling agent may previously be dissolved or dispersed therein if desired.

The aqueous medium includes water alone and mixtures of water with a solvent. Particularly in order to lower the viscosity of the resin components included in the above mentioned organic solvent phase when dispersed in an aqueous medium the solvent is preferably dissolves the resin components. The solvent is preferably a volatile solvent having a boiling point less than 100 C. because it can easily be removed. Specific examples of such a solvent include toluene xylene benzene carbon tetrachloride methylene chloride 1 2 dichloroethane 1 1 2 trichloroethane trichloroethylene chloroform monochlorobenzene dichloroethylidene methyl acetate ethyl acetate methyl ethyl ketone methyl isobutyl ketone etc. These solvents can be used alone or in combination.

A particulate resin is preferably dispersed in the aqueous medium. The particulate resin is used for the purpose of controlling the shape of a toner such as circularity and particle diameter distribution and mainly located on the surface of a toner. Specific examples of the organic particulate resin include any thermoplastic and thermosetting resins capable of forming a dispersion element such as vinyl resins a polyurethane resin an epoxy resin a polyester resin a polyamide resin a polyimide resin silicon resins a phenol resin a melamine resin a urea resin an aniline resin an ionomer resin a polycarbonate resin etc. These resins can be used alone or in combination. Among these resins the vinyl resins the polyurethane resin the epoxy resin the polyester resin and their combinations are preferably used in terms of forming an aqueous dispersion of microscopic spherical particulate resins.

Specific examples of the vinyl resins include homopolymerized or copolymerized polymers such as styrene metha esteracrylate resins styrene butadiene copolymers metha acrylic acid esteracrylate polymers styrene acrylonitrile copolymers styrene maleic acid anhydride copolymers and styrene metha acrylic acid copolymers.

The particulate resin is preferably dispersed in an aqueous medium in an amount of from 0.5 to 10 by weight based on total weight of the organic solvent phase. When not the organic solvent phase is too poorly emulsified in the aqueous medium to granulate. More preferably from 1 to 3 by weight. The particulate resin preferably has an average particle diameter of from 5 to 200 nm and more preferably from 20 to 300 nm in terms of granulation. In addition the particulate resin preferably has a glass transition temperature Tg of from 40 to 90 C. and more preferably from 50 to 70 C. in terms of the low temperature fixability and preservability of the resultant toner.

The weight average particle diameter and number average particle diameter of a toner are measured by Coulter Multisizer II from Beckman Coulter Inc. as follows 

0.1 to 5 ml of a detergent preferably alkylbenzene sulfonate is included as a dispersant in 100 to 150 ml of the electrolyte ISOTON R II from Coulter Scientific Japan Ltd. which is a NaCl aqueous solution including an elemental sodium content of 1 

2 to 20 mg of a toner sample is included in the electrolyte to be suspended therein and the suspended toner is dispersed by an ultrasonic disperser for about 1 to 3 min to prepare a sample dispersion liquid and

a volume and a number of the toner particles are measured by the above mentioned measurer using an aperture of 100 m to determine a weight distribution and a number distribution. weight average particle D diameter and a number average particle diameter of a toner can determined therefrom.

The circularity of the toner is measured by FPIA 2100 from SYSMEX CORPORATION and an analysis software FPIA 2100 Data Processing Program for FPIA version 00 10 was used. Specifically 0.1 to 0.5 g of the toner and 0.5 ml of a surfactant alkylbenzenesulfonate Neogen SC A from Dai ichi Kogyo Seiyaku Co. Ltd. having a concentration of 10 by weight were mixed with a micro spatel in a glass beaker having a capacity of 100 ml and 80 ml of ion exchange water was added to the mixture. The mixture was dispersed by an ultrasonic disperser W 113MK II from HONDA ELECTRONICS CO. LTD. for 3 min. The circularity of the toner was measured by FPIA 2100 until the dispersion has a concentration of from 5 000 to 15 000 pieces l which is essential in terms of measurement reproducibility of the average circularity. In order to obtain the concentration it is necessary to control added amounts of the surfactant and the toner. The amount of the surfactant depends on the hydrophobicity of the toner. When too much bubbles cause noises. When short the toner is not sufficiently wetted and not sufficiently dispersed. The amount of the toner depends on the particle diameter thereof. When small the amount needs to be less. When large the amount needs to be more. When the toner has a particle diameter of from 3 to 7 m the amount thereof is 0.1 to 0.5 g such that the dispersion has a concentration of from 5 000 to 15 000 pieces l.

As previously mentioned when comparatively a soft polyester resin is used as a toner binder the burial of an additive occasionally affects the transferability of the toner.

An additive burial rate is known as an index representing buriability of an additive. Hereinafter the additive burial rate will be explained.

The additive burial rate is an index representing a degree of an external additive burying in a toner due to a stirring stress in an image developer as time passes. When the surface of a toner has low mechanical strength and an additive is likely to bury therein the additive burial rate is high. The toner an additive is difficult to bury in has a low additive burial rate.

wherein A represents a BET specific surface area cm g of the toner and B represents a BET specific surface area cm g of the toner after buried.

10 g of the toner including an additive and 100 g of a resin coated ferrite carrier were placed in an ointment bottle having an inner capacity of from 300 to 500 ml and they are mixed by a Tubular Mixer for 30 min at 100 rpm.

Conventionally known resin coated ferrite carriers can be used as the resin coated ferrite carrier and a ferrite carrier coated with a silicone resin EF963 60B from Powdertech Co. Ltd. is used in the present invention.

After they are mixed for 30 min 300 ml of water are added in the ointment bottle made of polyethylene and the toner and the carrier are separated in the water by lightly stirring the mixture with a stirrer. The toner dispersion i.e. a supernatant solution therein is filtered to prepare a toner. The toner is dried under depressure at room temperature to prepare a toner after the additive is buried therein.

The BET specific surface areas of the toner and the toner after the additive is buried therein are measured by an automatic surface area pore distribution measurer TriStar 3000 from Shimadzu Corp. Specifically 1 g of the toner is placed in an own cell and the cell is deaerated by an own degassing unit VacuPrep 061 from Shimadzu Corp. The cell is deaerated under depressure at 100 mtorr or less for 20 hrs at room temperature. The BET specific surface area of the toner in the deaerated cell is automatically measured by TriStar 3000. Nitrogen gas is used as an absorption gas.

The toner for use in the present invention preferably has an additive burial rate of 42 . When the BET specific surface area of the toner before the additive is buried therein is not greater than 3 m g a coverage of the additive externally added thereto increases. The additive is more likely to mediate between the toners or the toner and a transfer material. Adherence between the toners or the toner and the a transfer material decreases and the transferability of the toner improves. Therefore the image forming apparatus performs transfer well and produces quality images with a two component developer including the toner and a carrier. In addition the toner maintains its fixability even at a lower fixing temperature which saves energy.

950 parts of water 20 parts of a water dispersion of a copolymer of styrene methacrylic acid butylacrylate sodium salt of sulfate oxide adduct of methacrylic acid 16 parts of of an aqueous solution of sodium dodecyldiphenyletherdisulfonate having a concentration of 48.5 ELEMINOL MON 7 from Sanyo Chemical Industries Ltd. 12 parts of an aqueous solution having a concentration of 3.0 by weight of a polymeric protective colloid carboxymethylcellulose sodium Selogen BSH from Sanyo Chemical Industries Ltd. and 130 parts of ethylacetate are mixed and stirred to prepare a lacteous liquid aqueous phase . 1 200 parts of water 50 parts of carbon black REGAL 400R from Cabot Corp. 50 parts of a polyester resin RS801 from Sanyo Chemical Industries Ltd. are mixed by a HENSCHEL mixer from Mitsui Mining Co. Ltd. with additional 30 parts of water to prepare a mixture. The mixture is kneaded by a two roll mil having a surface temperature of 150 C. for 30 min extended upon application of pressure cooled and pulverized by a pulverizer to prepare a carbon black masterbatch.

500 parts of a polyester resin RS801 from Sanyo Chemical Industries Ltd. having a weight average molecular weight of 19 000 and a Tg of 64 C. 30 parts of carnauba wax and 850 parts of ethylacetate are mixed in a container including a stirrer and a thermometer. The mixture is heated to have a temperature of 80 C. while stirred. After the temperature of 80 C. is maintained for 5 hrs the mixture is cooled to have a temperature of 30 C. in an hour. The carnauba wax is dispersed by a beads mill Ultra Visco Mill from IMECS CO. LTD. for 3 passes under the following conditions 

Next 110 parts of the carbon black masterbacth and 500 parts of ethylacetate are placed in the container and mixed therein for 1 hr to prepare a solution. The 240 parts of ethylacetate are further added thereto and the solution is dispersed by the beads mill for 3 passes at a liquid feeding speed of 1.2 kg hr a peripheral disc speed of 8 m sec and a filling amount of zirconia beads having diameter 0.5 mm of 80 by volume to prepare a dispersion oil phase .

1 780 parts of the oil phase 100 parts of a polyester prepolymer ethylacetate solution having a concentration of 50 from Sanyo Chemical Industries Ltd. having a weight average molecular weight of 3 800 a weight average molecular weight of 15 000 and a Tg of 60 C. 15 parts of isobutylalcohol and 7.5 parts of isophoronediamine are mixed in a container by TK HOMOMIXER from TOKUSHU KIKA KOGYO CO. LTD. at 6 000 rpm for 1 min to prepare a mixture. Then 1 200 parts of water are added in the container and the mixture is mixed by TK HOMOMIXER at 7 500 rpm for 20 min to prepare an aqueous medium dispersion.

The aqueous medium dispersion is placed in a container including a stirrer and a thermometer subjected to de solvent at 30 C. for 12 hrs and aged at 45 C. for 8 hrs to prepare a dispersion the organic solvent is removed from. 100 parts of the dispersion are filtered under reduced pressure to prepare a filtered cake and 500 parts of ion exchanged water are added to the filtered cake to prepare a mixture. The mixture is mixed by TK HOMOMIXER from at 12 000 rpm for 10 min and filtered under reduced pressure again. The filtered cake was dried by an air drier at 45 C. for 48 hrs and sieved by a mesh having an opening of 75 m to prepare parent toner particles.

The toner has a weight average particle diameter D of 5.8 m a number average particle diameter of 5.1 m an average circularity of 0.97 and an additive burial rate of 42 . The methods of measuring these are already mentioned.

The additive burial rate can be controlled by adjusting the molecular weight of the resin. For examples when the polyester resin RS801 from Sanyo Chemical Industries Ltd. having a weight average molecular weight of 19 000 and a Tg of 64 C. is replaced by a polyester resin from Sanyo Chemical Industries Ltd. having a weight average molecular weight of 12 000 and a Tg of 56 C. the resultant toner has a weight average particle diameter D of 5.7 m a number average particle diameter of 5.1 m an average circularity of 0.98 and an additive burial rate of 56 . When the polyester resin is replaced by a styrene acrylic resin the resultant toner has an additive burial rate of 30 .

As mentioned already an image forming system producing high quality and high definition images for long periods is desired even with comparatively a soft toner an external additive is likely to bury in. On the other hand a toner image is required to faithfully and stably transfer from an image bearer to an intermediate transferer and to a sheet therefrom. Adjusting a pressure of pressing the intermediate transferer to the surface of the image bearer affects the performance of the second transfer.

In consideration of the influence upon the performance of the second transfer in the image forming apparatus using a two component developer including a soft toner various experiments were made to determine a suitable pressure of the first transfer for forming quality images. The first transfer pressure was adjusted by changing a pressure of each press spring of each presser pressing the intermediate transfer belt to the photoreceptor drums Y M C and BK. The press spring for the photoreceptor drum Y was the above mentioned press spring Y.

The first transfer pressures were actual pressures of the first transfer roller Y M C and BK pressing the intermediate transfer belt . In the present invention since the first transfer rollers Y M C and BK contact the intermediate transfer belt upward in the vertical direction the first transfer pressures are pressures obtained by reducing weights of the first transfer rollers Y M C and BK from the pressures of the press springs.

In addition including elastic layers having an ASKER C hardness of 50 or less hardness the first transfer rollers Y M C and BK are likely to dent and have larger areas contacting the intermediate transfer belt . Therefore even when a balance of the first transfer pressure lowers in the axial directions of the first transfer rollers Y M C and BK due a tolerance of formation and composition thereof or the first transfer pressures are out of desired pressures deterioration of the second transfer performance is prevented or controlled to produce quality images. Therefore the first transfer pressure can be lowered.

Experimental results are shown in . Examples include conditions of producing quality or comparatively quality images which are applicable to the image forming apparatus of the present invention. Comparative Examples include conditions of producing not quality images.

The hollow level means a level of a defective hollow image line images and central images drop off from. The grainy level means a level of a defective nonsmooth image. The levels are graded on a scale of 1 to 5. The level 1 is worst and 5 is best. The tolerance level is 4 or 5.

In in Comparative Examples 1 to 3 the first transfer pressure of each color was equal to those of other colors. The pressure in Example 2 was lower than that in Example 1 and the pressure in Example 3 was even lower than that in Example 2. The hollow level in Comparative Example 1 had no problem the grainy levels of magenta and cyan therein were not acceptable. Since a soft toner is typically deformable the toner has a large area contacting the intermediate transfer belt and adheres there to more when the first transfer pressure is high. Therefore grainy or hollow images are likely to be produced.

In Comparative Examples 2 and 3 the grainy levels were improved more than that in Comparative Example 1 but the hollow image of C was not acceptable. This is because a low first transfer pressure lowered the adherence of a toner to the intermediate transfer belt and the second transfer performance was improved to reduce the grainy images but the low first transfer pressure was insufficient for overlapping two color toners resulting in defective transfers as hollow images.

In Examples 1 and 2 lowering only the first transfer pressure of a black toner finally transferred both of the grainy and hollow images improved to be in the tolerance level. This is because as mentioned above a low first transfer pressure lowered the adherence of a toner to the intermediate transfer belt and the second transfer performance was improved to reduce the grainy images and lowering only the first transfer pressure of a black toner did not cause defective transfers as hollow images.

Since a black toner is rarely overlapped with other color toners on the intermediate transfer belt or a sheet lowering only the first transfer pressure of a black toner is thought not to cause hollow images.

From a comparison between Example 1 and Comparative Example 2 and Example 2 and Comparative Example 3 the grainy levels were slightly poorer than when the pressures for all colors were lowered.

A toner used in this evaluation had an additive burial rate of 42 . The intermediate transfer belt was formed of a polyimide resin and had a volume resistivity of 1 10 cm and a surface resistivity of 1 10 .

Toners used in Comparative Examples to had an additive burial rate less than 40 . The hollow level in each thereof had no problem but the fixability at a low temperature and a low humidity 10 C. 15 therein was insufficient.

Comparative Examples 7 to 9 using toners having additive burial rates not less than 40 had no hollow image problem and the fixability at a low temperature and a low humidity in each thereof improved. However the grainy levels were all worsened and unacceptable.

Examples 3 to 5 using toners having additive burial rates not less than 40 and lowering only the first transfer pressure of a black toner reached the tolerance levels in both of the grainy and hollow images. The fixability at low temperature and low humidity in each thereof was also good.

Polyester resins form a toner having low mechanical strength high additive burial rate and low temperature fixability.

The intermediate transfer belt was formed of a polyimide resin and had a volume resistivity of 1 10 cm and a surface resistivity of 1 10 .

Only when a yellow image a magenta image a cyan image and a black image are formed in this order grainy levels of the overlapped two color images red green and blue are acceptable.

when yellow is overlapped with magenta the resultant image becomes red and the magenta background is undistinguished even when yellow comes off 

when yellow is overlapped with cyan the resultant image becomes green and the cyan background is undistinguished even when yellow comes off and

when magenta is overlapped with cyan the resultant image becomes blue and the cyan background is undistinguished even when magenta comes off.

Other color orders cause grainy images e.g. when cyan is overlapped with magenta the resultant image becomes blue and the magenta background is distinguished when cyan comes off.

From the upstream in the direction A from undistinguished colors to distinguished colors are preferably formed. A transfer bias is likely to disturb an image located upstream in the direction A and a disturbed image is undistinguished because from undistinguished colors to distinguished colors are formed from the upstream in the direction A. In addition even when a color toner on the upstream side of the direction A adheres to an image bearer for a color toner on the downstream side therein the color toner on the upstream side is undistinguished and not likely to cause defective images.

A toner used in Example 6 and Comparative Examples 10 to 12 had a additive burial rates of 42 . The intermediate transfer belt was formed of a polyimide resin and had a volume resistivity of 1 10 cm and a surface resistivity of 1 10 .

From the above mentioned experimental results conditions for producing luality images are as follows.

It is essential that a toner has an additive burial rate not less than 40 and that a first transfer pressure of a black toner image is lower than first transfer pressures of other color toner images.

As mentioned above in consideration of the distinguished black toner largely influencing the resultant images when adhering to the photoreceptor drums Y M and C the black toner image is preferably transferred onto the intermediate transfer belt last. The first transfer pressure of the black toner image lower than those of the other color toner images is applied last to improve the grainy and hollow images.

In addition a yellow toner image is preferably transferred onto the intermediate transfer belt first because yellow is most undistinguished and the grainy levels are improved.

Further it is preferable that a magenta toner image and a cyan toner image are transferred onto the intermediate transfer belt secondly and thirdly respectively because of being undistinguished this order and the grainy levels are improved.

A toner preferably includes a polyester resin as a binder resin because of being likely to have an additive burial rate not less than 40 improving grainy levels of the resultant images even when the first transfer pressure is low and having good fixability at low temperature and low humidity.

Points different from those of the first embodiment in this embodiment will be mainly explained and the other points have the same numerals as those of the first embodiment and explanations thereof are omitted.

In an image forming apparatus a transfer belt unit is located above in the vertical direction of image forming stations Y M C and BK. Pressers Y M C and BK contact first transfer rollers Y M C and BK to an intermediate transfer belt downward in the vertical direction to press the intermediate transfer belt to photoreceptor drums Y M C and BK.

The pressers Y M C and BK specifically include the first transfer rollers Y M C and BK and a holder not shown displaceably holding the first transfer rollers Y M C and BK in the vertical direction. The pressers Y M C and BK do not have biasing means biasing the first transfer rollers Y M C and BK toward the intermediate transfer belt such as the press spring Y in the first embodiment and the first transfer rollers Y M C and BK contact the intermediate transfer belt under their own weights. Therefore the pressers Y M C and BK press the intermediate transfer belt to the photoreceptor drums Y M C and BK downward in the vertical direction under own weights of the first transfer rollers Y M C and BK.

The first transfer rollers Y M C and BK have metallic cored bars and elastic layers covering the outer circumferential surfaces of the metallic cored bars and have an ASKER C hardness not greater than 50 with the elastic layers.

In the image forming apparatus of the second embodiment the reason why the pressers Y M C and BK press the intermediate transfer belt to the photoreceptor drums Y M C and BK downward in the vertical direction with the first transfer rollers Y M C and BK is that a tolerance of a biasing force of the biasing means biasing the first transfer rollers Y M C and BK toward the intermediate transfer belt such as the press spring Y in the first embodiment may cause uneven image density in the main scanning direction and grainy images on one side therein when black images are produced.

When the first transfer rollers Y M C and BK are located vertically below the photoreceptor drums Y M C and BK respectively the first transfer rollers Y M C and BK are pressed to the photoreceptor drums Y M C and BK against their own weights and the biasing force of the biasing means biasing the first transfer rollers Y M C and BK toward the intermediate transfer belt such as the press spring Y needs strengthening. When the biasing force is strengthened tolerances thereof are likely to lose the pressure balances in the scanning direction causing the uneven image density and grainy images.

Specifically as Example 1 when the first transfer pressure of the black toner image is 70 g cm the first transfer pressure of either of ends in the scanning direction is larger than 70 g cmand the grainy levels cannot be improved. As Example 2 when the first transfer pressure of the black toner image is 50 g cm the first transfer pressure of either of ends in the scanning direction is smaller than 50 g cm resulting in deterioration of transfer efficiency and defective transfer.

When the first transfer rollers Y M C and BK are located vertically above the photoreceptor drums Y M C and BK the first transfer rollers Y M C and BK need not be pressed to the photoreceptor drums Y M C and BK against their own weights the first transfer pressure balance improves in the scanning direction and the uneven image density and grainy images are prevented more than in the first embodiment.

In this embodiment the first transfer pressures are own weights of the first transfer rollers Y M C and BK only and a member such as the press spring Y may be used for applying the first transfer pressure. Since the member need not have a biasing force against the weights of the first transfer rollers Y M C and BK and the biasing force can only be supplementary. Therefore the first transfer pressure balance in the scanning direction is good. However in terms of simple structure downsizing and low cost the first transfer pressures are preferably generated only by own weights of the first transfer rollers Y M C and BK.

In addition including elastic layers having an ASKER C hardness of 50 or less hardness the first transfer rollers Y M C and BK are likely to dent and have larger areas contacting the intermediate transfer belt . Therefore even when a balance of the first transfer pressure lowers in the axial directions of the first transfer rollers Y M C and BK due a tolerance of formation and composition thereof or the first transfer pressures are out of desired pressures deterioration of the second transfer performance is prevented or controlled to produce quality images. Therefore the first transfer pressure can be lowered.

The image forming apparatus of the second embodiment is different from the image forming apparatus of the first embodiment at a point where it is a complex machine of a printer and a facsimile a point where the second transferer is included in a transfer and transport unit also transporting a sheet to the fixer and a point where a both side printing unit is omitted.

Specifically the grainy level is lower than the lowest acceptable level 4 when the BET specific surface area of the toner before the additive is buried therein is greater than 3 m g even if the first transfer pressure is adjusted to improve the grainy level.

It is thought that this is because a coverage of the additive externally added to a toner is low and the additive is less likely to mediate between the toners or the toner and a transfer material an intermediate transfer belt and that adherence between the toners or the toner and the transfer material the intermediate transfer belt increases and the transferability of the toner deteriorates when the BET specific surface area of the toner before the additive is buried therein is greater than 3 m g.

Therefore in addition to the additive having a burial rate not less than 40 and the higher first transfer pressure to the black toner than those to the others the BET specific surface area of the toner before the additive is buried therein greater than 3 m g more highly or precisely improves the grainy level.

Circularity SF and SF also represent the shape of a toner but only its two dimensional relief structure. Meanwhile the BET specific surface area represents three dimensional relief structure. The BET specific surface area highly relates to a coverage of the additive and the coverage of the additive highly relates to the transferability of a toner affecting the grainy level thereof. Therefore the BET specific surface area relates to the transferability and the grainy level of a toner. In the present invention the BET specific surface area of a toner is more effectively used than the circularity SF and SF thereof.

As a result the BET specific surface area of a toner before the additive is buried therein highly relating to a coverage of the additive is preferably not greater than 3 m g.

Having now fully described the invention it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that many changes and modifications can be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth therein.

For example each color toner image may directly be transferred onto a sheet without using an intermediate transferer. In this case toner images on plural image bearers are directly transferred onto the sheet.

The image forming apparatus may be a stand alone copier a printer or a facsimile not limited to a complex machine thereof and may have other combinations such as a combination of a copier and a printer.
