Embodiments of the invention relate to the field of wireless telecommunication networks and more particularly to a system and method for notifying a mobile device that it has crossed a wireless signal coverage boundary e.g. entering or exiting a wireless signal coverage area associated with an access point.

Conventional wireless telecommunication networks such as cellular and digital wireless telephony networks create a geographically large coverage area through the use of base stations antennas e.g. Node B and Base Transceiver Station cell towers Mobile Switching Centers MSCs and other equipment common to wireless telecommunication network infrastructure deployments. Conventional network infrastructure provides geographically large coverage areas capable of supporting large numbers of simultaneous communication sessions with mobile devices.

In some situations it may be desirable for a telephony service provider operating such a network to deploy wireless base stations that are capable of establishing comparatively small network coverage areas. The wireless base stations are less sophisticated and less costly devices that are typically designed to provide wireless telephone network coverage to a few mobile devices e.g. 4 to 6 simultaneous mobile devices rather than the large numbers e.g. 100 simultaneous mobile devices provided by a conventional network telecommunications system. The coverage area of the wireless base stations is also designed to be small compared with that of conventional network infrastructure for example limited to the size of a home or an office versus a coverage area of several densely populated city blocks or rural coverage expanding over potentially hundreds of acres. The small coverage areas established by such base stations may be referred to as femto cells. 

Femto cells and their corresponding base stations often referred to as Femto Cell Base Stations or Home Node Bs HNBs are commonly deployed by telephony network providers and are designed to operate with the same mobile devices that operate within a larger wireless telecommunications network. For example a telephony service provider operating a GSM Global System for Mobile communications network will design the base stations to operate with GSM compatible mobile devices. Similar to conventional network base stations femto cell base stations broadcast a pilot signal that when encountered by a compatible mobile device can trigger the mobile device to connect with the femto cell base station and consequently disconnect from a nearby base station in what is referred to as a handoff. 

Handoffs between network base stations conventional or otherwise are intentionally designed to be imperceptible to the mobile device being handed off or to end users of such devices. However in some wireless telephony applications it may be desirable for mobile devices to be notified of a successful handoff to another base station such as a short range femto cell base station. Notification may be desirable for a variety of reasons but generally speaking the use of a femto cell benefits end users via improved signal quality enhanced network services and potentially reduced fees when operating within a femto cell. Telephony service providers also benefit from use of femto cell technology by way of reduced network load on a corresponding conventional network. Accordingly notifying end users of femto cell use is beneficial to telephony service providers and end users alike.

Unfortunately conventional mechanisms for notifying a mobile device of its entry or exit from a femto cell coverage area are insufficient. Some base stations hardware manufacturers transmit a tone or a beep to mobile devices within the femto cell coverage area by decompressing the audio stream sent to the mobile device inserting the tone or beep by either mixing it with the audio stream to produce a combination of the notification tone and the audio stream or blocking out the audio stream and substituting the tone in place of the audio stream and re compressing the audio stream for transmission to the mobile device during the time period of the notification tone playback. While such a technique is feasible it requires costly hardware and processing capabilities to decompress and recompress the compressed audio stream quickly enough to avoid perceptible audio delays or content loss at the mobile device. Sophisticated decompression and compression processing power is a costly addition to an otherwise low cost device and when multiplied over thousands of units the costs may become overly burdensome to a service provider who otherwise desires to deploy femto cell technology. Adding near real time compression and decompression capabilities to a femto cell base station may become so cost prohibitive to a service provider looking to scale up a deployment program that the entire technology becomes economically infeasible.

In the following description numerous specific details are set forth such as examples of specific systems languages components etc. in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent however to one skilled in the art that these specific details need not be employed to practice the present invention. In other instances well known materials or methods have not been described in detail in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.

Described herein are a system and method for enabling an access point to determine that a mobile device has crossed a wireless coverage area boundary associated with the access point and select for transmission to the mobile device an audible notification indicating the mobile device has crossed the wireless coverage boundary associated with the access point wherein the audible notification is stored at the access point in compressed form prior to determining the mobile device has crossed the wireless coverage area boundary.

In one embodiment compressed audible notifications such as pre recorded or synthesized voice messages are stored at an access point and encoded into a compressed audio stream destined for a mobile device. Compressed notification messages are introduced into the compressed audio stream without requiring a decompression and re compression cycle of the compressed audio stream as is required by conventional techniques. Because the notification messages are stored in a compressed format e.g. pre compressed prior to an event requiring their use they may be encoded into to compressed audio stream by replacing a segment of the compressed audio stream with a corresponding segment containing the compressed notification message.

In some embodiments amplitude discontinuity reduction is performed to reduce audibly perceptible pops that may be introduced when replacing a segment of the compressed audio stream with an audible notification message in compressed form rather than summing in the notification message as an analog waveform into a decompressed portion of the audio stream. Amplitude discontinuity reduction may include for example adding taper data to frame boundaries adjacent to the compressed audible notification as well as other methods described in more detail below.

Providing notification capabilities to mobile devices without requiring that a base station support near real time compression and decompression capabilities dramatically reduces the complexity and required computing capabilities of the base station and thus reduces the overall cost to deploy such technology.

SP may be a telecommunications company that provides wireless voice services wireless data services or both. SP may operate a wireless communications network infrastructure that communicates over a licensed band of wireless spectrum and operates in accordance with well known wireless communication protocols. Such protocols may include for example a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS compatible protocol a Global System for Mobile communications GSM compatible protocol a Code Division Multiple Access CDMA compatible protocol a Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access WiMAX compatible protocol and so forth.

SP communicates with MSC via SP backhaul which is a high speed data connection owned or leased by SP . For example SP backhaul may be a digital signal DS1 or T1 communications interface providing network connectivity between SP and MSC . Importantly SP backhaul is financially supported by SP as an overhead component of operating network .

MSC provides interoperability between an SP s wireless telephony network and traditional land line networks as well as other wireless telephony networks not operated by SP . MSC further provides connectivity between multiple mobile devices operating within SP s network. MSC performs other conventional MSC responsibilities including setting up and releasing end to end connections between telephony devices handling usage tracking for billing purposes and coordinating handoffs between network infrastructure cell towers.

Each MSC typically manages multiple Radio Network Controllers RNCs or Base Station Controllers BSCs depending on whether the network infrastructure corresponds with second generation 2G or third generation 3G mobile telecommunication standards. Each RNC BSC in turn manages multiple cellular towers such as Base Transceiver Station BTS or Node B cell tower A and B again depending on whether the network infrastructure corresponds with 2G or 3G mobile telecommunication standards. Each cell tower is responsible for handling the functions related to wireless radio communications with mobile devices operating within an infrastructure coverage area provided by the cell tower . Such functions include paging of mobile devices allocating radio channels radio signal quality management and coordinating voice and data communications between mobile devices in the cell tower s infrastructure coverage area . In some telecommunication networks functions of MSC RNC BSC and BTS Node B cell towers may be broken down into additional physical or logical components however the basic overall wireless network infrastructure e.g. 2G and 3G wireless communication standards which correspond to for example Global System for Mobile communications GSM and Universal Mobile Telecommunication System UMTS respectively is well known in the art.

Each cell tower provides a corresponding infrastructure coverage area . Telecommunication network operators e.g. SP carefully deploy BTS Node B cell towers in a systematic manner to provide as geographically large of a coverage area as possible while minimizing overlap and minimizing the overall number of cell towers required. Another consideration is the amount of bandwidth required in a particular area. For example a densely populated city center will require more bandwidth for the same geographically sized area than a sparsely populated rural area.

Infrastructure coverage area A is provided by BTS Node B cell tower A and geographically encompasses buildings A B and C. Buildings generally represent an end users residence office shopping center or other places and locations from which an end user may access wireless telecommunication services. Obviously a user need not be inside a building to utilize a mobile device on SP s network. Building E is shown only marginally within infrastructure coverage area A and thus will suffer from very poor network connectivity or have no access to SP s network as infrastructure coverage area is insufficient to communicate with mobile devices operating from the location of building E.

Building D is shown within infrastructure coverage area B provided by BTS Node B cell tower B however building D is encompassed by access point coverage area provided by access point e.g. within wireless coverage area boundary associated with access point . Access point coverage area provides access to SP s network via access point rather than through conventional network infrastructure such as BTS Node B cell tower B. Access point coverage area is shown providing such access in a location that is within a coverage area e.g. B provided by conventional network infrastructure however access point could similarly be deployed at building E thus providing access point coverage for the building s E location which lacks sufficient access to SP s network by conventional means.

Access point is shown communicably interfaced with SP via private backhaul through private internet carrier . Rather than utilizing a data interface paid for and operated by SP as is done by conventional BTS Node B cell towers A and B access point communicates with service provider via a regular internet connection e.g. private backhaul such as a Digital Subscriber Line DSL Fiber Optic connection e.g. such as those offered by Verizon FiOS or a cable internet connection e.g. such as those offered by Comcast provided by a private internet carrier . Internet connections such as these are commonplace in most residences businesses and commercial properties and are adequate for transmitting compressed audio streams between access point and service provider . In some embodiments Quality of Service QoS parameters may be employed to guarantee a minimum acceptable level of performance on private backhaul by marking and giving priority to packets associated with access point .

An access point as referred to herein may be for example a pico cell base station or a femto cell base station. A pico cell base station provides a short range wireless coverage area via an antenna operating with limited power and communicates with a remote Base Station Controller BSC typically connected via twisted pair ISDN connection or Ethernet. Such a BSC typically manages multiple pico cells and routes wireless communication traffic from the pico cell onto a backhaul internet connection for transmission to a centralized service provider. A femto cell base station likewise provides a short range wireless coverage area via an antenna operating under limited power however a femto cell may also contains basic BSC functionality to route wireless communication traffic to a centralized service provider and possibly basic Mobile Switching Center MSC functionality enabling the femto cell base station to coordinate mobile telephony traffic including functionality to establish end to end connections handle handoffs between network cell towers and appropriately route telephony voice communications e.g. transmit switched packets to a connected mobile device . Alternatively an access point may be another type of base station.

Mobile devices A and B communicate wirelessly with cell towers A and B via air interface . Similarly mobile device B communicates with access point via air interface . Air interface represents the wireless communication signals protocols and interface between the cell tower and mobile devices and between access point and mobile devices .

Mobile device A is shown near the outside perimeter of both infrastructure coverage area A and infrastructure coverage area B and is depicted to be in communication with both BTS Node B cell towers A and B. As mobile device A moves away from BTS Node B cell towers A and B it eventually exceeds the optimal infrastructure coverage area of cell tower A and comes within range of infrastructure coverage area associated with cell tower B. When this occurs the network initiates a handoff of a wireless communication session associated with mobile device A from cell tower A to cell tower B. The handoff is seamless from the perspective of mobile device A however once the handoff is complete mobile device A communicates with cell tower B to access network services rather than cell tower A. Mobile device A could however again relocate into the infrastructure coverage area A associated with cell tower A and another handoff would occur this time back to cell tower A.

Similarly mobile device B is shown completely within the infrastructure coverage area B of cell tower B however is near the wireless coverage area boundary associated with access point . As mobile device B nears wireless coverage area boundary associated with access point the network will coordinate a handoff from cell tower B to access point . Similarly as mobile device B moves away from access point and away from the wireless coverage area boundary the network will coordinate a handoff back to cell tower B.

Mobile device may be a conventional cell phone compatible with one or more wireless communication protocols e.g. UMTS GSM CDMA etc. or may be a wireless handheld device such as a Personal Digital Assistant PDA a smart phone a laptop computer or PC enabled to communicate with wireless networks e.g. through a wireless network access card or other electronic device capable of sending and receiving data or voice information via wireless communication networks.

Access point coverage area provided by access point is geographically small compared with that of infrastructure coverage areas associated with conventional cell towers e.g. BTS Node B cell towers A and B . For example access point coverage area may be limited to a house office building shopping mall apartment building etc. Through the use of multiple access point antennas access point coverage area and its corresponding boundary may be expanded to larger areas such as a university or corporate campus however such implementations are still geographically small in comparison to a conventional infrastructure coverage area which may cover several city blocks or hundreds of acres in rural areas.

As mobile devices A and B enter and exit access point coverage area associated with access point e.g. cross wireless coverage area boundary in either direction various notifications A B and C are transmitted to mobile devices A and B.

In one embodiment mobile device B wirelessly communicates with cell tower via air interface . Mobile device B has an ongoing wireless communication session with cell tower over which mobile device B can exchange wireless communication data such as a compressed audio stream or digital information e.g. application data website data application prompts etc. with cell tower . In one embodiment a compressed audio stream originates from a second telephony device such as another mobile device or a landline telephone. In other embodiments wireless communication session may carry digital information that originates from a website responsive to a request from mobile device B or carry application data destined for a mobile application operating on the mobile device.

When mobile device B transitions into access point coverage area wireless communication session will be handed off to access point and access point will then transmit wireless communication data e.g. compressed audio streams or digital information to mobile device B via a new wireless communication session between the mobile device and access point .

Access point may encode a notification A B or C into wireless communication data destined for mobile devices A or B. For example depicts access point transmitting wireless communication data to mobile devices A and B with notifications encoded into the original compressed audio stream or digital information.

In one embodiment access point encodes a notification e.g. A or B into a compressed audio stream for transmission to a mobile device e.g. A or B upon determining that the mobile device e.g. A or B has crossed wireless coverage area boundary entering or exiting the access point coverage area . For example access point may replace a segment or portion of the compressed audio stream with a compressed audible notification stored at the access point and transmit the notification e.g. A or B to the mobile device e.g. A or B within the compressed audio stream via the wireless communication session.

In one embodiment access point encodes notification B into a compressed audio stream for transmission to mobile device A upon determining that mobile device A is exiting the access point coverage area . In one embodiment access point encodes notification A into a compressed audio stream for transmission to mobile device B upon determining that mobile device B is entering the access point coverage area .

In one embodiment access point encodes application interface notification C into a digital information destined for mobile device A or B upon determining that mobile device A or B is crossing wireless coverage area boundary entering or exiting the access point coverage area or upon some other event. For example access point may alter application data destined for an application executing at the mobile device causing the application to display for example an application prompt a text message or transmit an audible tone. Similarly access point may modify HyperText Markup Language HTML data destined for a web browser operating at mobile device causing the web browser to redirect to a webpage controlled by or stored at the access point. Access point may similarly send a JAVA compatible application prompt directed at a JAVA virtual machine compatible servlet application or a similar Object Oriented Programming OOP based servlet executing at the mobile device with instructions for the servlet to display the prompt at the mobile device.

Audible notifications A and B may include tones or beeps indicating that mobile device has entered or exited access point coverage area or crossed its corresponding boundary. In some embodiments audible notifications A and B may include pre recorded or synthesized e.g. computer generated speech. Audible notifications A and B may further include arbitrary waveforms stored in either compressed or uncompressed format where the waveform is a stored representation of recorded tones music speech or other sounds captured by a suitable waveform capture or audio recording device. For example audible notification A may include a pre recorded voice message stating You have now entered a femto cell . . . additional services or features are available. Similarly audible notification B may include a pre recorded or synthesized voice message stating You are now leaving the femto cell coverage area . . . femto cell coverage area rates and services are no longer available. 

Based on the notifications received an end user or a mobile device e.g. may be able to determine the geographic location of the wireless coverage area boundary . An end user may desire to know the scope or extent of a coverage area associated with an access point to make informed decisions regarding billing rates service quality and so forth.

In one embodiment audible notification messages A and B are stored at the access point in already compressed form and are encoded into compressed audio streams without decompressing or recompressing either the audible notification messages or any portion of the compressed audio stream. For example the compressed audible notifications are available e.g. stored at the access point in a pre compressed form prior to detecting an event requiring their use e.g. determining that a mobile device has crossed a boundary associated with the access point prior to establishing a wireless communication session with a particular mobile device and prior to transmitting a compressed audio stream from a service provider to such a mobile device . The compressed audible notifications may be received from another source such as a service provider in compressed form or received in wave form and compressed at the access point prior to their required use e.g. using low cost but non real time compression capabilities or more sophisticated real time compression capabilities when available .

In one embodiment application interface notification C includes text corresponding with an audible notification message and is transmitted to mobile device as a redundant message in alternate form e.g. in textual form rather than audible form . In one embodiment application interface notification C provides supplemental information associated with an audible notification message e.g. A and B such as textual information indicating what additional services are available within the access point coverage area .

Additional services available within the access point coverage area may include for example alternate billing rates for voice telephony communications e.g. lower per minute usage fees or free minutes accrual rather than a reduction of anytime minutes alternate billing rates for data communications e.g. lower per megabyte usage fees or no usage fee for data access within a femto cell or within a access point coverage area improved bit rates for voice telephony communications e.g. use of less aggressive compression and improved sampling rates or both resulting in improved voice quality and improved transfer speeds for data communications e.g. improved maximum download speeds compared to maximum allowable download speeds available when operating within conventional infrastructure coverage area .

Additional services available within the access point coverage area may further include local file sharing location notification e commerce and Private Branch eXchange PBX services. For example local file sharing services include functionality to share media and other electronic data and files between the mobile device and other electronic devices communicatively interfaced with the access point . Such electronic devices may include other mobile devices connected with the access point personal computers operating within a home network and communicatively interfaced e.g. networked over a Local Area Network portable devices video game systems and so forth. Electronic data and files may include documents music files audio visual files executable binary files photos and so forth whether stored on PCs or other mobile devices associated with the access point.

Location notification services may be available to indicate whether other mobile devices associated with the access point are communicatively interfaced with the access point at a given time or provide an approximate location for such devices if not currently connected with the access point. For example upon connecting with the access point a user may elect to have a mobile device be notified that for example a child s or spouse s mobile device is currently within range or out of range from the access point coverage area and by extension whether or not the child or spouse is home . The access point may access additional location information such as an approximate geographic location associated with a specified mobile phone through the service provider e.g. a geographic location based on cell tower associations or Global Positioning Information solicited from a compatible mobile device .

E commerce services may be available which enable the mobile device to access media and services directly from the mobile device. For example within the access point coverage area the mobile device may be enabled to download ringtones music files audio visual files games pictures and so forth. Such content may not be available outside of the access point coverage area or require payment of a higher fee.

Local Private Branch eXchange PBX services between the mobile device and other telephony devices communicatively interfaced with the access point may likewise be available. Such capabilities enable the mobile device to interface with other mobile devices within the access point coverage area and further with land line based telephones or other telephony devices communicatively interfaced with the access point e.g. through a home network router or LAN . PBX services are known in the art and include functionality such as call transferring conference calls call forwarding call waiting voice mail call hold and so forth.

In one embodiment audible notifications A and B describe additional services and benefits available within access point coverage area when entering e.g. you will not be charged for minutes used while operating within the access point coverage area or the loss of such services and benefits when exiting e.g. you will now be charged your default billing rate for minutes used outside of the access point coverage area . Audible notifications describing benefits and services may be user configurable. For example an end user may configure the access point to provide audible notifications detailing additional services by default or configure the access point to announce the additional services responsive to a number sequence pressed during a phone call e.g. by pressing for example during a phone call or responsive to for example a text message or a message from an application executing at the mobile device.

In one embodiment audible notifications are transmitted back to a service provider for transmission to a second telephony device connected end to end with mobile device . For example access point may replace a segment or portion of an outgoing compressed audio stream originating at mobile device and destined for a second connected mobile device or landline handset with the same audible notification as is transmitted to mobile device . In this example both mobile devices connected via an end to end telephony communication session e.g. a phone call would receive the same audible notification. In some embodiments access point may transmit a different audible notification e.g. A to a second telephony device than the audible message transmitted to mobile device .

In one embodiment access point may select one or more audible notifications e.g. A and B to encode into the compressed audio stream for transmission to mobile device . The audible notifications may pre loaded into access point or may be managed remotely for example by a remote service provider such as SP of e.g. the service provider may cause the access point to automatically download and store updated audible notifications in compressed form and use the updated audible notifications as directed by the service provider .

The audible notifications stored at an access point may also include multiple versions of the a message for example multiple versions to accommodate different compression protocols required by different mobile devices or wireless protocols multiple versions of a similar message to accommodate different spoken languages and so forth. Likewise multiple compressed audible notifications may be used to indicate different events services and rates e.g. different variations of beeps and tones or different voice messages describing corresponding events services and rates .

In one embodiment the remote service provider provides an event to audible notification map that associates particular events determinable at access point to particular audible notifications. For example events may include determining a mobile device has entered or exited a coverage area or crossed a boundary associated with access point determining a visiting mobile device has entered or exited a coverage area determining a registered mobile device has entered or exited a coverage area determining an unauthorized device has entered or exited a coverage area determining an unauthorized device has entered a coverage area and accessed an emergency services number e.g. dialing 9 1 1 via access point determining a smart phone capable of running OOP based applications has entered or exited a coverage area determining a mobile device incapable of running OOP based programs has entered a coverage area.

In one embodiment selecting one or more audible notifications may be based on other logical conditions in conjunction with the notification map. For example the access point may utilize data information or conditions determinable at the access point. For example the internal time of the access point may compared against a time based schedule the identity of a mobile device may be compared against a member list within the access point to determine if the mobile device is a known member or an unknown guest in relation to the access point. The access point may choose different audible notifications based on the current population of other mobile devices associated with the access point for example the access point may notify an incoming mobile device that other family members are currently home or that all the children are home or not home based on the population of mobile devices currently operating within range of the access point. Other data points that may be used include environmental attributes such as internal temperature external temperature humidity and local weather report data e.g. tides moon precipitation cloud cover wind speed direction and so forth . Network condition information may also be used in the selection of audible notifications including information regarding network link failures low bandwidth status network status report data and excessive link delay status. Such conditions may degrade telephony services and thus a corresponding audible notification may indicate that voice quality will be poor that connectivity outside of the access point coverage area is unavailable or that perceptible audible delays may be present.

In one embodiment access point selects an audible notification e.g. A or B based on a event to audible notification map provided by a service provider. In one embodiment access point selects an audible notification based on an end user configurable parameter stored at the access point.

The decompressed audio wave has three segments. Leading portion of the compressed audio stream is shown decompressed. This leading portion may be a segment or portion of for example a voice telephone call that precedes a replaced portion of the compressed audio stream containing the audible notification. Similarly trailing portion of the compressed audio stream is shown decompressed. This trailing portion may be a segment or portion of for example the same voice telephone call that follows a replaced portion of the compressed audio stream containing the audible notification. Stated differently leading portion and trailing portion are original portions of the compressed audio stream shown in decompressed form as received at an access point having originated at a second end point telephonically interfaced with the mobile device end point.

However middle portion is not an original portion of the compressed audio stream as received at the access point. Rather middle portion illustrates the segment or portion of the compressed audio stream replaced with a compressed audible notification at the access point shown in decompressed form .

As discussed above an access point may replace a segment or portion of a compressed audio stream with a compressed audible notification. When a mobile device receives the compressed audio stream it will decompress and audibly transmit e.g. play the audio via an integrated speaker the compressed audio stream including the segment replaced with the compressed audible notification. However replacing portions of a compressed audio stream in such a way may lead to amplitude discontinuities due to a waveform mismatch e.g. a sharp or sudden increase or decrease in amplitude at a frame boundary between an original segment of the compressed audio stream and a replaced segment of the compressed audio stream.

For example amplitude discontinuity at the frame boundary between segment and depicts a sharp increase in amplitude rather than a smooth wave pattern increase. Such a amplitude discontinuity when audibly transmitted through a speaker may cause a popping or clicking sound depending on the severity of the amplitude discontinuity . Various methods for decreasing clicks and pops caused by amplitude discontinuity between original and replaced portions of a decompressed audio stream are discussed below.

Frame boundaries and are adjacent and when decompressed would potentially contain an amplitude discontinuity e.g. as shown between portions and of above. Similarly frame boundaries and are adjacent and when decompressed would potentially contain an amplitude discontinuity e.g. as shown between portions and of above.

In some embodiments compressed audio stream contains a voice stream compressed in accordance with Adaptive Multi Rate compression AMR on a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS operated by a service provider. In an alternative embodiment compressed audio stream contains a voice stream compressed in accordance with Linear Predictive Coding LPC on a Global System for Mobile communications GSM operated by a service provider

The access point may perform amplitude discontinuity blending matching or band filtering on the portion of the compressed audio stream known to potentially contain amplitude discontinuities . For example the access point may decompress block short targeted slices e.g. sub portions of a compressed audio stream and match blend or band filter block the decompressed audio waveform or perform some combination and re compress block the decompressed short targeted slices.

Decompressing and recompressing very small portions such as slices of portions located at frame boundaries consumes far less time and computing resources than decompressing and recompressing entire portions of a compressed audio stream and thus allows an access point to be manufactured for lower cost than a system having full near real time compression and decompression capabilities.

In one embodiment the access point decompresses trailing frame boundary of leading portion and leading frame boundary of middle portion containing the audible notification performs amplitude matching blending and or band limit filtering to reduce amplitude discontinuity between the decompressed frame boundaries and and recompresses the decompressed frame boundaries. The access point may perform similar functions on adjacent frame boundaries and to reduce amplitude discontinuity between the two frame boundaries when in decompressed form.

As shown compressed audio stream may contain multiple sequential data frames which may in some embodiments correspond with data packets on a switched packet network. In some embodiments segment replaced with a compressed audible notification may be made up of one or more sequential data frames which constitute a subset of sequential data frames making up the compressed audio stream.

An alternative mechanism for reducing amplitude discontinuity between portions of a compressed audio stream adjacent to a segment of the compressed audio stream replaced with a compressed audible notification is to add taper data leading into and out of the segment replaced with the compressed audible notification e.g. segment . Taper data may be added without decompressing or recompressing any portion of the compressed audio stream and thus requires very little computing resources compared to a system having compression and decompression capabilities.

For example in one embodiment lead in taper data is added to either the trailing edge of leading portion preceding replaced portion to the leading edge of replaced portion following leading portion or both. Similarly lead out taper data is added to a trailing edge of replaced portion to a leading edge of trailing portion or to both. In such an embodiment lead in and lead out taper data e.g. and respectively reduce the overall amplitude discontinuity and thus reduce perceptible clicking and popping without requiring compression or decompression capabilities. An audio taper function implementing the injection of lead in and lead out taper data e.g. and within a pre compressed audio waveform such as the compressed audio stream operates by scaling up or down on a block by block basis all frequency coefficients or an equivalent representation of the frequency coefficients within in a compressed audio waveform segment or file in equal proportions.

In some embodiments lead in taper data and lead out taper data is included as part of a compressed audible notification. For example taper data e.g. and may be added to a pre recorded voice message in analog form compressed in accordance with appropriate wireless protocols e.g. AMR compression for UMTS systems and then the compressed audible notification including the incorporated taper data may be pre loaded onto an access point or download to an access point at a later time. Similarly taper data e.g. and may be added to an already compressed audible notification and stored for later use negating the need to apply taper data to the frame boundaries when the audible notification is embedded or encoded into the compressed audio stream. A combination of the above techniques may also be used.

Memory provides volatile and non volatile storage capabilities within access point . Memory may include Random Access Memory RAM or equivalent operational memory and may further include permanent storage such as Read Only Memory ROM Non Volatile Random Access Memory NVRAM Hard Disk Drive HDD storage optical storage and so forth. Memory contains application and multiple pre compressed audible notifications . Application may execute with the aid of a Central Processing Unit CPU and reside in volatile memory while the pre compressed audible notifications may reside in permanent storage within memory without the need for execution.

Application may provide an Application Programming Interface API or a message interface with which to send and receive application messages and prompts to a corresponding application executing at a mobile device. APIs and message interfaces may include Short Message Service SMS message capabilities remote application prompts HTML based web traffic and so forth.

Backhaul interface provides a communication interface to a private internet connection and thus a communications interface back to a service provider. Notification selector may select one or more of the multiple pre compressed audible notifications based on events detected at the access point a mapping provided by a service provider and stored at the access point or based on an end user configurable parameter or parameter set stored at the access point.

Decompressor and compressor provide decompression of compressed audio streams and compression of audio waveforms into compressed audio streams respectively. Increased computing e.g. CPU capabilities are required to perform large amounts of compression and decompression while relatively small amounts of computing capabilities are required to perform small compression and decompression tasks such as decompressing and recompressing slices frame boundaries or sub portions of compressed audio stream segments.

Matcher blender and band limit filter performs amplitude discontinuity reduction on decompressed waveforms for example by reducing the disparity in amplitude of a wave at two adjacent frame boundaries by filtering out audible clicks and pops via screening for sharp drop offs or rises in amplitude or by limiting a portion of a decompressed waveform e.g. a portion corresponding to adjacent frame boundaries at a replaced segment of a compressed audio stream to a narrow amplitude discontinuities within a frequency band or range.

Segment replacer e.g. a segment replacing unit a segment substitution unit or a notification encoder performs the replacement of original segments of a compressed audio stream with one or more replacement segments containing pre compressed audible notifications for transmission to a mobile device.

Radio subsystem includes receiver and transmitter . Radio subsystem enables access point to communicate with a mobile device wirelessly over an air interface. Receiver enables the reception of wireless signals from a mobile device and transmitter enables the transmission of wireless signals to a mobile device.

Memory provides volatile and non volatile storage capabilities within mobile device . Memory may include RAM or equivalent operational memory and may further include permanent storage such as ROM NVRAM HDD storage optical storage and so forth. Memory contains application which may provide an API and messaging interface to remote applications such as application executing at access point .

Processor provides execution capabilities and memory access services for application . User interface provides a graphical or textual based interface with which an end user may interact with mobile device and application executing thereon.

Decompressor decompresses the compressed audio stream received from access points or from conventional cell towers and sends the decompressed audio waveform extracted from the compressed audio stream to audible transmitter . Audible transmitter audibly transmits the decompressed audio waveform for example via an integrated speaker making the decompressed audio waveform perceptible to an end user.

Radio subsystem includes receiver and transmitter . Radio subsystem enables mobile device to communication with an access point wirelessly over an air interface. Receiver enables the reception of wireless signals from an access point and transmitter enables the transmission of wireless signals to an access point.

Method may be performed by processing logic that may include hardware e.g. circuitry dedicated logic programmable logic microcode etc. software e.g. instructions run on a processing device to perform hardware simulation or a combination thereof. In one embodiment method is performed by a computing device such as access point of .

Referring to method begins with processing logic in an access point communicably interfaced with a wireless telecommunications network the access point receives a plurality of compressed audible notifications from a service provider and a notification mapping associating the compressed audible notifications with events block .

At block processing logic in the access point accepts a wireless communication session handoff request for a handoff of the mobile device between a network infrastructure cell tower and the access point.

At block the access point determines that a mobile device has crossed a wireless coverage area boundary associated with the access point based on receiving the request for the wireless communication session handoff of the mobile device between the network infrastructure cell tower and the access point. For example access point may determine that a mobile device has crossed a wireless coverage area boundary entering into a coverage area associated with the access point by determining that the handoff request is for an incoming handoff from an external conventional network infrastructure cell tower coming to the access point. Similarly the access point may determine that the mobile device has crossed the wireless coverage area boundary exiting out of the coverage area associated with the access point by determining that the handoff request is for an outbound or outgoing handoff from the access point itself to an external conventional network infrastructure cell tower.

At block processing logic in the access point selects for transmission to the mobile device an audible notification from a plurality of audible notifications. Each audible notification is stored at the access point in compressed form prior to determining the mobile device has crossed the wireless coverage area boundary and the audible notification is selected based on the notification mapping.

At block the access point establishes a wireless communication session with the mobile device and at block receives a compressed audio stream from a service provider for transmission to the mobile device via the wireless communication session. At block the access point encodes e.g. embeds injects introduces the compressed audible notification within the compressed audio stream for transmission to the mobile device via the wireless communication session by replacing a segment of the compressed audio stream from the service provider with the selected compressed audible notification.

At block processing logic in the access point transmits the compressed audible notification to the mobile device within the compressed audio stream via the replaced segment of the compressed audio stream responsive to accepting the wireless communication session handoff.

At block the access point adds taper data at one or more frame boundaries of one or more sequential data frames of the compressed audio stream to reduce amplitude discontinuity between the compressed audio stream and the compressed audible notification.

At block processing logic in the access point sends a second compressed audible notification to the mobile device wherein the second compressed audible notification is stored at the access point in compressed form prior to determining the mobile device has crossed the wireless coverage area boundary a second time.

At block processing logic in the access point sends an application interface notification to the mobile device the application interface notification indicating the mobile device has crossed the wireless coverage boundary associated with the access point.

At block processing logic in the access point sends the compressed audible notification to a service provider communicatively interfaced with the access point for transmission to a telephonic device attached with the mobile device via an end to end telephony interface e.g. a second mobile device or a land line handset connected via a telephone call .
