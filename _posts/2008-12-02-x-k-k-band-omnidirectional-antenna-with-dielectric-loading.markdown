The invention was made with United States Government support under Contract No. W15P7T 05 C P627 awarded by the U.S. Army. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.

This invention relates to microwave antennas and more particularly to the utilization of an X K and K band omnidirectional antenna with dielectric loading.

Broadband microwave communications provide the opportunity for miniaturized systems generally unobtainable at lower frequencies. Components including antennas can make these systems very expensive however.

Radio frequency communication with air and space platforms provides the opportunity to remotely track objects over large distances. Military operations especially have a need for tracking technology for air to ground Combat Identification CID . This generally includes microwave communications.

As an example a Digital Radio Frequency Tag DRaFT can provide flexible technology to allow radars such as Moving Target Indicator MTI and Synthetic Aperture Radar SAR to receive data from ground devices. At the frequencies used by these systems small lightweight and affordable RF Tags can provide for data extraction from unattended ground sensors and communication with vehicles and personnel throughout an area. This is particularly useful for the identification and location of combined units. Other advanced tag functions include additional communications capabilities for enhanced interoperability with identification and communications systems.

Ultra wideband UWB systems provide the benefit of radio transmissions that use a very large bandwidth. This can convey more signal information including data or radar resolution. Although no set bandwidth defines a signal as UWB systems using bandwidths greater than about ten percent are typically called UWB systems. A typical UWB system may use a bandwidth of one third to one half of the center frequency.

Broadband operation in the X K and K bands is desirable but applicable biconical antennas are cost prohibitive and too large for applications. They can cost thousands of dollars and occupy a volume as large as a tennis ball. Currently multiple antennas are required to cover this bandwidth especially both above and below the horizontal plane.

Current microwave broadband antennas are expensive difficult to integrate into systems and can have relatively narrow operating frequencies.

The above problems of biconical and similar antennas are solved by providing an X K and K band omni directional antenna with dielectric loading. Advantages of the new antenna are that it is small very inexpensive omni directional simply constructed and easily reproducible. It includes the microwave frequency bands of 8 to 12 GHz X 12 to 18 GHz K and 18 to 27 GHz K . This is approximately twice the bandwidth of prior antennas. Scaling dimensions larger results in performance at lower frequencies. Applications include car top deployment.

Embodiments include a dielectrically loaded omnidirectional broadband antenna comprising a ground plane a conductor and a dielectric resonator whereby the antenna is loaded. In embodiments the radiation is in the X Ku and K bands and the resonant frequency is about approximately between 7.5 GHz and 26 GHz. In other embodiments the dielectric resonator is proximate the ground plane or in contact with the ground plane. For embodiments the dielectric resonator is a toroid with rectangular cross section of about approximately 99.5 percent pure alumina and the relative dielectric constant of the dielectric resonator is about approximately 9.7. In yet other embodiments the length of the conductor is about approximately 0.387 inch the ground plane comprises a copper disk and the ground plane diameter is about approximately six inches. For embodiments the radiation polarization is about approximately vertical the radiation pattern provides transmit and receive reciprocity and the radiation pattern is substantially omnidirectional in the plane of the ground plane. In antenna embodiments the radiation pattern azimuth coverage is uniform between about approximately plus ten and about approximately plus seventy degrees.

Other embodiments include a dielectrically loaded omnidirectional microwave antenna comprising a ground plane a conductor having a length of 0.387 inch and a diameter of about approximately 0.050 inch and a dielectric resonator having an outer diameter of about approximately 0.290 inch an inner diameter of about approximately 0.102 inch and height of about approximately 0.151 inch whereby the antenna is loaded.

An embodiment is a microwave frequency tag comprising at least one broadband microwave antenna comprising a ground plane a conductor a dielectric resonator whereby the antenna is loaded and circuitry in electrical communication with the antenna whereby the microwave frequency tag communicates with a transceiver. For embodiments the tag is associated with personnel the tag is associated with vehicles and the tag is a digital radio frequency tag DRaFT . Other embodiments comprise two antennas in close proximity wherein there is less than 1 dB of gain pattern variation in azimuth.

The features and advantages described herein are not all inclusive and in particular many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings specification and claims. Moreover it should be noted that the language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes and not to limit the scope of the inventive subject matter.

Embodiments of the antenna are very small one fortieth 1 40th of a cubic inch have good azimuth coverage from at least 10 degrees to at least 70 degrees elevation and have extremely wide bandwidth from approximately 7.5 to approximately 26 GHz. They are very low cost and very simple to connect to a transmit receive microwave apparatus. Embodiments have vertical polarization.

In embodiments two antennas perform transmit receive functions. The mutual effects of two antennas in close proximity approximately two wavelengths apart on a common ground plane display only slight azimuth pattern perturbation. There is less than 1 dB of wobble as azimuth as the pattern is measured over 360 degrees passive antenna rotated about the active antenna .

It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of this disclosure. It is intended that the scope of the invention be limited not by this detailed description but rather by the claims appended hereto.
