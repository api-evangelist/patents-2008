Embodiments relate generally to document processing and in particular to methods and apparatus related to processing of at least a portion of a document based on a document template.

As society becomes more impersonal through such wide area media as the world wide web it has become desirable to formally document rules of engagement between parties providing using services of one another. This has led to an explosion of contractual documentation often crafted by the service provider to which parties must formally or impliedly agree in order to avail themselves of the products and or services covered by such contracts. The need to approve and reconfirm lengthy and frequently changing documents including End User License Agreements EULAs Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policies often poses such an imposition on productivity that many users agree to the terms of such contracts without taking the time to read them and understand the obligations and restrictions imposed by them. Often users are uncomfortable with this exposure but take such risks because of the burden of having to read and understand these contracts which can be lengthy and filled with legalese that a typical user may not understand even if they take the time to read the document in its entirety.

Thus a need exists for methods and apparatus for processing at least a portion of a document based on a document template.

In one embodiment a method includes receiving a portion of text from a document. A document type is associated with the document based on at least one of the portion of text or an identifier associated with the document. The method also includes selecting based on the document type a document template having a plurality of sections. Each section from the plurality of sections being associated with a document category. At least one section from the plurality of sections including at least one policy preference.

A document analysis engine can be configured to process in response to a request from a user a portion of a document based on a document template. Specifically the document analysis engine can be configured to compare a section of the document template to the portion of the document based on an interpretation of the portion of the document using a parsing function. The parsing function can be configured to interpret the portion of the document based on an ontology and or a semantic rule. In some embodiments an action can be performed and or triggered based on whether the comparison satisfies a threshold condition. Moreover the document analysis engine can function as a policy filter on behalf of the user by applying policies defined within the document template. In some embodiments a condition action combination can be referred to as a policy preference.

In some embodiments the document template can be customized by a user and or can be defined based on a master template. In some embodiments the document template and or the parsing function can be selected based on an identifier and or a term associated with the document template. In some embodiments the document can be associated with target content requested for for example viewing by the user.

In some embodiments the actions performed and or triggered can be based on a comparison of a document template with a document that is associated with target content. For example if the document is a contractual document associated with target content requested by the user e.g. an End User License Agreement EULA or a privacy policy associated with a web page the document analysis engine can be configured to determine based on a parsing module and a user defined template whether or not a specified portion of the document would be acceptable to the user. In some embodiments the document analysis engine can be configured to identify portions of the document that should be reviewed by the user. In some embodiments the document analysis engine can be configured to restrict or allow access to the target content based on the analysis of the document.

It is noted that as used in this written description and the appended claims the singular forms a an and the include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus for example the term a template is intended to mean a single template or a combination collection of templates. Also many of the embodiments are described in connection with processing of contracts by way of example only. Any of the embodiments described herein can be generally applied to the processing e.g. analysis of any type of document.

In some embodiments the document can be defined based on one or more types of documents such as for example a contract e.g. a lease contract a EULA a terms and conditions contract a real property contract etc. a book e.g. a compilation an article e.g. a publication a journal article a newspaper article a user manual a technical reference document a compliance report and so forth. In some embodiments the document can include text e.g. digitized text digitized text acquired from a web page and or media e.g. images maps photos technical drawings flowcharts etc. video audio . In some embodiments the document can be processed for example by the document analysis engine so that the document can be electronically processed by the document analysis engine . In some embodiments the document can be an entire document or multiple documents or a portion of a document or a portion of multiple documents .

One or more sections within the template used during analysis of the document can include text e.g. digitized text and or media e.g. images video audio . In some embodiments the sections within a template can be defined so that they correspond with one or more sections associated with the document . In some embodiments the template can include sections that typically appear in a particular type of document identified for analysis using the document analysis engine .

In some embodiments a section within the template can include key words that can be used by the template module during comparison of the section of the template with the document . In some embodiments the key words can be in a particular order and or can be related according to specified semantic rules.

In some embodiments the template can included standardized sections and or customized sections defined by for example a user e.g. the requesting entity . In other words one or more sections of the template can include standardized language adopted by for example a governing body or organization. Accordingly the document can be compared with standardized language included in the template .

The parsing module can be configured to interpret e.g. determine a meaning for extract a meaning from the document based on one or more document parsing functions such as document parsing function shown in . Specifically the document parsing function can be configured to parse at least a portion of text and or a portion of a media object e.g. an image a video an audio snippet from the document . The document parsing function can be configured to interpret one or more portions or groups of one or more portions parsed from the document .

In some embodiments the document parsing function can include for example language processing portions e.g. language processing functional portions that are defined based on one or more ontological structures and or one or more semantic rules. The ontological structure s and or the semantic rule s included within the language processing portion s of the document parsing function can be used by the parsing function to interpret a portion of a document . In some embodiments the interpretation can be based on probabilistic rules e.g. probabilistic matching with an interpretation encoded within the document parsing function . In some embodiments the document parsing function can be configured to interpret the document based on natural language processing techniques.

In some embodiments the document parsing function can include for example various tools that can be used by the parsing module to process e.g. physically process the document . For example the document parsing function can include an optical character reader OCR function that can be used to convert text and or media included in a paper document into an electronic format that can be processed by the document analysis engine . In some embodiments for example the document parsing function can include a speech detection recognition system that can translate propagating sound waves and or digitized representations of sound waves e.g. speech music to text that can then be processed by the document analysis engine .

In some embodiments the document parsing function of the parsing module can be configured to parse the document e.g. parse text and or media included in the document into sections that correspond with sections included within a template . In some embodiments the document parsing function can be configured to rearrange e.g. move combine portions of the document so that they correspond with sections included within a template . In other words the document parsing function can be configured to prepare the document for comparison with the template . In some embodiments for example portions of the document can be rearranged by the parsing module based on semantic relationships between words and or the relationships between sections within the template . Accordingly interpretations can be associated with rearranged portions of the document e.g. new portions of the document that are defined based on original portions of the document that have been parsed and combined into the new portions . Moreover the template and the document parsing function can be defined so that they are compatible with e.g. consistent with customized for one another. More details related to parsing functions are discussed in connection with .

One or more sections within the template can be associated with one or more conditions and or actions that can be performed triggered based on whether or not the conditions are satisfied. For example template can include one or more template sections that can be associated with one or more conditions and or one or more actions. In some embodiments the sections of the template and associated conditions actions can collectively be referred to as a template policy. In some embodiments multiple conditions can correspond with an action and or multiple actions can correspond with a condition. In some embodiments a condition action combination can be referred to as a policy preference.

Specifically one or more actions can be performed and or triggered by the template module based on a comparison of a section of template with the interpretation of a portion of the document by the parsing module . For example the template module can be configured to perform and or trigger an action based on whether or not a comparison of an interpretation associated with a portion s of the document with a section within the template satisfies one or more criteria. Although not shown in some embodiments the actions performed and or triggered by the document analysis engine can be defined in a database e.g. a template database that can be accessed by the template module .

In some embodiments the actions that can be performed and or triggered by the template module in response to a comparison of a portion of the template e.g. a section with the interpretation of the document by the parsing module can be for example blocking and or allowing access to e.g. viewing privileges to editing privileges to one or more portions of the document by the requesting entity . In some embodiments the document analysis engine can be configured to identify certain portions of the document that may require further review for example by the requesting entity . In some embodiments if the document is a contract the document analysis engine can be configured to identify one or more terms or sections associated with the contract that should be accepted or rejected. In some embodiments the document analysis engine can be configured to suggest changes to the document based on the processing of the document . In some embodiments the document analysis engine can be configured to send a notification to for example the requesting entity based on the content of the document .

In some embodiments the document analysis engine can be configured to provide an assessment of the document to the requesting entity . For example if the document is a contract the document analysis engine can identify portions of the document as more restrictive or less restrictive than specified sections of the template .

In some embodiments the document analysis engine e.g. the template module of the document analysis engine can provide options with respect to any of the actions for example to the requesting entity . In some embodiments providing an option can be considered or encoded as an action. For example the document analysis engine can be configured to provide options with respect whether or not to block allow access to a specified portion s of the document and or options with respect to accepting denying a specified portion s of the document . In some embodiments the options and or actions can be accompanied by information defined based on the processing of the document by the document analysis engine . For example one or more options can be accompanied by a highlighted portion and or an interpretation e.g. a meaning of a specified portion s of the document as determined by the document analysis engine . More details related to conditions and or actions as related to templates are discussed in connection with .

In some embodiments the template e.g. sections of the template with associated conditions and or actions sections of the template associated with a policy preference can be defined based on one or more master templates also can be referred to as master document templates . In some embodiments the template can be stored in a template database not shown where the template can be accessed by the template module . In some embodiments the template can be defined at least in part based on one or more preferences of the requesting entity and or a different entity not shown than the requesting entity . In some embodiments the template or a portion of the template can be applied to only a portion of the document by the template module based a user preference e.g. a policy a condition . More details related to templates are discussed in connection with .

In some embodiments the document parsing function or a portion thereof and or the template e.g. a section with associated conditions and or actions can be selected for use in processing the document based on one or more identifiers and or one or more terms associated with the document . For example an identifier such as an electronic tag e.g. metadata a link and or one or more terms e.g. a title heading a paragraph associated with one or more portions of the document e.g. the entire document can be received interpreted and used by the document analysis engine to select the document parsing function and or the template or template policy . The identifier s and or term s can be received by the document analysis engine in response to a request from the document analysis engine and or extracted from one or more portions of the document and or data associated with the document .

For example the document parsing functions or a portion thereof used by the parsing module and or the template or a portion thereof used by the template module to process the document can be selected based on a document type associated with the document based on analysis of an identifier and or a term from the document . For example if one or more portions of the document is identified as being defined based on a EULA document type the parsing module can be configured to determine a meaning of the portion s of the document based on a parsing function such as document parsing function corresponding with a EULA document type. Likewise the template module can be configured to apply one or more templates such as template based on the portion s of the document being defined based on a EULA document type. In some embodiments the document analysis engine can be configured to present an option e.g. an option in a prompt to the requesting entity or a different entity to accept e.g. confirm or reject the selection or portions of the selection of the template s and or document parsing function s . In some embodiments the document analysis engine can be configured so that the requesting entity or a different entity can manually make a selection or override an automatic selection by the document analysis engine of a document parsing function s and or a template s .

In some embodiments the identifier s and or the term s associated with one or more portions of the document can be received interpreted and used during a preliminary processing time period so that the document parsing function and or a template or template policy can be selected. In other words the document parsing function and or the template can be selected from a library of document parsing functions not shown in and or a library of templates not shown in respectively based on analysis of an identifier s and or a term s associated with the document . In some embodiments the preliminary processing can be performed based on a default or generalized document parsing function not shown and or a default or generalized template not shown . After the document parsing function and the template have been selected the document parsing function can be used by the parsing module and or the template can be used by the template module to process the portion s of the document during a secondary processing time period.

In some embodiments processing of the document can be performed in an iterative fashion by the document analysis engine. For example in some embodiments analysis of the document by the template module and or the parsing module can be performed iteratively to refine an analysis of the document . In some embodiments the iterative processing by the template module can be performed based on different templates not shown during different iterations. In some embodiments the iterative processing by the document parsing function can be performed based on different document parsing functions not shown during different iterations. In some embodiments the document parsing functions and or the templates can be selected based on threshold conditions defined by for example the requesting entity .

In some embodiments a first analysis of a document may produce a first level of results e.g. a hierarchical categorization . A second analysis of the document may produce a second level of results based on or unrelated to the first level of results. The first analysis and the second analysis can be performed by the document analysis engine using different or same templates and or different or same document parsing functions. In some embodiments the document analysis engine can be configured to analyze the document multiple times and prompt a user e.g. the request entity to select one or more of the results of the analysis.

Although not shown in in some embodiments the parsing module and or the template module can apply different document parsing functions or portions thereof and different templates or portions thereof to different portions of the document . For example if the document analysis engine determines that a first portion of the document corresponds with a EULA e.g. is a EULA document type and that a second portion of the document corresponds with a real estate contract e.g. is a real estate contract document type the first portion of the document can be processed based on a document parsing function associated with the EULA and the second portion of the document can be processed based on a document parsing function associated with the real estate contract.

In some embodiments one or more document parsing functions and or one or more templates can be selected based on a preference of a user such as the requesting entity . For example the user can define a priority preference that can be used by the document analysis engine to select one or more templates over another template or to select one or more document parsing functions over another document parsing function. In some embodiments one or more document parsing functions and or templates can be customized and associated with an identifier associated with the requesting entity . In other words the customized document parsing functions and or templates can be associated with the requesting entity using the identifier. In response to a request from the requesting entity to process the document the document analysis engine can use the identifier to fetch the customized document parsing functions and or templates so that the document can be processed based on the customized document parsing functions and or templates.

In some embodiments the document can be associated with target content not shown and processing of the document can be triggered in response to a request by the requesting entity to access the target content. For example the target content can be an application that can be downloaded or associated with a webpage e.g. content included within a webpage and the document can be a terms and condition contract and or EULA associated with e.g. referenced in linked to the target content. In some embodiments one or more portions of the target content can be analyzed in addition to the document in which case the target content can be referred to as a document .

Any of the actions and or options which can be actions performed and or triggered by the document analysis engine with respect to the document can be applied to the target content as well. For example the document analysis engine e.g. the template module of the document analysis engine can for example block and or allow access by the requesting entity or a different entity to one or more portions of the target content based on processing of the document . In some embodiments if the document is a contract the document analysis engine can be configured to identify one or more terms or sections associated with the contract that could should be accepted or rejected before the target content is accessed. In some embodiments the document analysis engine can be configured to send a notification to for example the requesting entity about the target content based on the content of the document associated with the target content.

In some embodiments an identifier and or term that can be used to select the document parsing function e.g. select from a library of document parsing functions and or the template e.g. select from a library of templates can be associated with the target content. For example the identifier and or term can be associated with a link e.g. a hyperlink a universal resource locator URL if the target content is a webpage used to access the target content or included within the target content.

In some embodiments one or more portions of the document analysis engine can be a hardware based module e.g. a digital signal processor DSP a field programmable gate array FPGA and or a software based module e.g. a module of computer code a set of processor readable instructions that can be executed at a processor which could be associated with a memory . In some embodiments for example the document analysis engine can be encoded within an application e.g. a java based application a web based application that can be installed on and or served to for example a personal computer. Any of the operations e.g. functions performed by the document analysis engine can be included within one or more modules. For example one or more operations performed by the parsing module and or the template module can be combined into a single module or divided in multiple modules including modules that are not shown .

Although not shown in some embodiments the document analysis engine can be made available as a web service. For example the document analysis engine can be invoked via a web browser. In some embodiments the document analysis engine can be accessed via an account e.g. a user account associated with for example a requesting entity. In some embodiments the functionality associated with the document analysis engine can be made available and invoked via an application programming interface API .

In some embodiments any of the operations performed by the document analysis engine can be manually triggered by for example the requesting entity or a different entity . In some embodiments any of the operations performed by the document analysis engine can be triggered by an entity not shown other than the requesting entity . For example the actions and or options can be presented to an entity different than the requesting entity . In some embodiments one or more portions of templates such as template and or document parsing functions such as document parsing function can be defined by an entity different than the requesting entity .

In some embodiments the document provider can be any entity that can send e.g. transmit provide the document to the document analysis engine for processing. In some embodiments the document provider can be configured to send the document to the document analysis engine in a format and or based on a protocol that can be compatibly processed by the document analysis engine . In some embodiments the document analysis engine can have one or more modules configured to convert e.g. translate the document into a format e.g. a protocol that can be compatibly processed by the document analysis engine . In some embodiments the document provider can be for example a wired device and or a wireless device such as for example a computing entity e.g. a personal computing device a mobile phone a personal digital assistant PDA and or a server e.g. a web server host .

The network can be for example a local area network LAN and or a wide area network WAN . In some embodiments the network can include one or more wired and or wireless segments. Although not shown the document analysis engine the document provider and or the requesting entity can be included within a single computing environment e.g. a personal computer . Although not shown in some embodiments a document can be received at a computer via for example a universal serial bus USB port or a different port e.g. firewire port . The document can be scanned via a scanner and transmitted to the computer via the USB port. The document can be analyzed by a document analysis engine installed at or accessed from e.g. via a network the computer.

In some embodiments the document analysis engine can be configured to analyze documents that include text and or images related to various languages and or cultures. In some embodiments for example the document parsing function can be configured to translate one or more portions of the document for comparison with a section of the template .

In some embodiments any portion of the document analysis engine can be configured to allow for prompt and or require human interaction e.g. intervention . For example the document analysis engine can be configured to prompt a user for approval by the user or manual intervention e.g. editing selection by the user for any action taken by the document analysis engine .

In this embodiment the templates are included in a template database that can be accessed by a template module . In some embodiments the template database can be stored in a memory such as a local memory e.g. a hard drive a random access memory RAM and or a distributed database that can be accessed for example via a network.

Each of the templates can include conditions and or actions e.g. a policy preference that can be used by the template module when processing one or more portions of a document such as document shown in . In some embodiments the templates can include references e.g. pointers back to the master templates and or conditions and or actions included within the master templates . In such embodiments the master templates and or associated conditions actions can be stored in a location s e.g. at the document analysis engine where they can be accessed by the template module when processing a document.

Although not shown in some embodiments the template definition module can be included within a document analysis engine such as the document analysis engine shown in . Accordingly the document analysis engine can be used to not only define a template and associated actions conditions but also can be used to process e.g. analyze a document based on the template.

The contract sections can include text e.g. digitized text and or media e.g. images video audio associated with different provisions and or clauses of a contract. For example the provisions which can also be referred to as categories can include for example a severability provision or clause a choice of law provision or clause a warranty provision or clause an indemnification provision or clause a confidentiality provision or clause and so forth.

As shown in the user specific contract template includes a subset of the contract sections and conditions actions from the master contract template . Specifically the user specific contract template includes contract section which is associated with condition action E and contract section B which is associated with condition I and action K. In this embodiment contract section B is a modified version of contract section . Contract section from the master contract template is not included in the user specific contract policy .

As indicated in the user specific contract template is defined based on selections by a user from the master contract template . In some embodiments the selections by the user can be performed via a template definition module such as template definition module shown in . In some embodiments modifying one or more of the contract sections such as the modification of contract section into contract section B when defining a user specific contract policy may not be allowed.

In some embodiments a set of policy preferences condition action pairs can be defined based on a global selection by a user. For example condition action E condition J action K and condition L action M can be selected and used to define a user specific contract not shown based on a single selectable link to this set of policy preferences.

In some embodiments each of the master templates can be defined based on a document type. In some embodiments the master templates can be defined based on ontologies and or semantic rules used to define the parsing functions . For example parsing function R and master template U e.g. sections within the master template U and T which is associated with parsing function R can be defined based on ontologies and or semantic rules defined for processing a EULA. In other words the document templates e.g. the master templates and customized templates can be defined so that they are compatible with e.g. consistent with the analytical processes encoded within the parsing functions . Accordingly if a document selected for analysis is a EULA parsing function R and master template U can be used to analyze the EULA.

As shown in a contract type is determined at . In some embodiments the contract type can be determined based a term e.g. a single word a collection of words and or based on an identifier associated with the portion of the contract.

If a contract type cannot be determined at an action can be performed and or triggered. For example in some embodiments a user can be notified that the portion of the contract cannot be analyzed. In some embodiments one or more portions of the portion of the contract can be provided to the user and or the user can be prompted to make a manual decision with respect to the portion of the contract. In some embodiments the user can trigger for example a document analysis engine to ignore the portion of the contract cannot be analyzed. In some embodiments the user may not be notified that a contract type could not be determined and or the portion of the contract can be automatically handled for example by a document analysis engine. For example a document analysis engine can be configured to automatically ignore portions of the portion of the contract that cannot be analyzed.

A contract template is selected based on the contract type at . In some embodiments the contract template can be a contract template defined based on a master contract template. The contract template can include one or more sections that can be associated with conditions and or actions.

A contract parsing function is selected based on the contract type at . In some embodiments the contract parsing function can be selected based on the contract template that is selected at . In other words a contract parsing function corresponding with the contract template can be automatically selected when the contract template is selected.

In some embodiments a user can be notified if a contract template and or a contract parsing function cannot be associated with the portion of the contract. For example if a contract template for the particular contract type has not been created by the user the user can be notified that a contract template could not be identified. In such instances a document analysis engine for example can be configured to automatically ignore the portion of the contract analyze the portion of the contract based on a different contract template e.g. a default contract template and or different contract parsing function e.g. a default contract parsing function provide the user with options e.g. manually triggered options for handling the scenario e.g. options for ignoring the portion of the contract etc. and so forth.

A meaning for the portion of the contract is determined based on the contract parsing function at . In other words the portion of the contract can be interpreted based on the contract parsing function. If the portion of the contract includes text the meaning can be determined based on one or more ontologies associated with the contract parsing function and or one or more semantic rules associated with the contract parsing function. In some embodiments the one or more ontologies can be defined specifically for the contract type.

The meaning of the portion of the contract is associated and compared with a section of the contract template at . The section can be associated with a contractual provision or a contractual term e.g. a single word that defines a term a collection of words that define a term .

In some embodiments if a meaning for at least a portion of the portion of the contract cannot be desirably determined e.g. determined within a specified threshold accuracy based on the contract parsing function at and or the meaning cannot be associated with a section of the contract template at one or more actions can be performed and or triggered. For example in some embodiments a user can be notified of the issue via for example a user interface prompt. In some embodiments the portion of the contract or a portion of the portion of the contract that could not be interpreted can be automatically ignored. In some embodiments a user can be presented with one or more portions of the portion of the contract that could not be analyzed e.g. interpreted and or can be presented with options e.g. manually triggered options for handling the portion of the contract e.g. options for ignoring the portion of text etc. . In some embodiments the portion of the contract can be analyzed based on one or more different contract parsing functions until for example a meaning for the portion of the contract can be determined.

An action is performed based on the comparison of the meaning of the portion of the contract with the section of the contract template when at least one condition is satisfied at . For example access to e.g. viewing privileges to editing privileges to one or more portions of content associated with the portion of the contract can be automatically blocked and or allowed if the comparison of the section of the contract template with the portion of the contract satisfies the condition s . For example if the meaning of the portion of the contract is substantially different than the section of the contract template a user can be notified and or a change to the portion of the contract can be suggested. In some embodiments if the meaning of the portion of the contract is substantially different than the section of the contract template a user can be prevented from viewing content associated with the portion of the contract.

Although is a flowchart related to analysis of a portion of a contract in some embodiments the flowchart can be used to analyze text and or media that can be associated with different types of documents such as a book or a journal article. In some embodiments one or more portions of the method can be performed in a different order and or can require human interaction in order to proceed. For example in some embodiments the contract parsing function can be selected based on the contract type shown at before the contract template is selected based on the contract type shown at . In such instances the contract template can be selected based on the contract parsing function that is selected. In some embodiments the contract template must be approved by a user before the contract template is used to analyze one or more portions of the contract.

Portion of the contract is interpreted at the parsing module based on parsing function . A meaning associated with the portion is compared with contract section of the master contract template using template module . As shown in contract section is associated with two different condition action combinations condition action A and condition action A. Condition action A is selected from the master contract template based on user preferences applied by the preference module . Rather than analyzing the contract based on a customized contract template defined based on a master contract template the contract is dynamically analyzed based on a combination of a master contract template and user preferences . In some embodiments the user preference can be a global preference used to define a set of policy preferences.

Portion of the contract is interpreted at the parsing module based on parsing function . In this embodiment the portion of the contract is not associated with a specific contract section from the master contract template . Because a meaning associated with the portion cannot be compared with any of the contract sections included in the master contract template a default condition action is executed.

As shown in the document analysis engine is configured to send a signal to entity Y in response to the analysis of the document prompted by entity X. In other words the document analysis engine can be configured to send the signal to entity Y even though the analysis of document was triggered by a entity X which is a different and or independent entity.

In some embodiments the signal can be related to a notification sent to entity Y based on subscription. In other words entity Y can subscribe to receive a notification based on a particular event related to a document such as document . In some embodiments the document analysis engine can be configured to perform and or trigger an action e.g. ignore accept with respect to for example document as instructed in a subscription. In some embodiments the action can be performed and or triggered in lieu of or in addition to the signal .

For example in some embodiments entity Y can register in a subscription with the document analysis engine to be notified if a change in document is detected. Signal can be sent to entity Y in response to the document analysis engine detecting a change in document after being prompted by entity X to analyze the document . The change can be detected based on a stored copy e.g. a cached copy of the document . The signal can include information related to the change e.g. types of change s assessment of the change more restrictive language less restrictive language etc. . In some embodiments the document analysis engine can send a notification to entity Y based on a subscription to receive notifications when changes to any document or portions of any document of a certain class are detected.

In some embodiments document analysis engine can be configured to automatically send a signal e.g. a notification signal to entity Y when a document such as document that has previously been requested for analysis by entity Y is later analyzed in response to a request from a different entity such as entity X. Specifically the document analysis engine can be configured to track e.g. collect store information related to document analysis requests by entity Y and can use that tracked data also can be referred to as historical data to later notify entity Y of changes to documents previously requested for analysis. Accordingly signal can be a signal generated based on historical data related to documents requested for analysis by entity Y. In some embodiments the document analysis engine can be configured to notify entity Y when a change has been made to a document previously requested for analysis by entity Y. In some embodiments the document analysis engine can provide an assessment of the change based on a cached copy of the document. The document analysis engine can be configured to store the tracked data in for example a local memory not shown and or a remote database not shown .

In some embodiments threshold conditions related to notifications can be defined by entity Y. For example entity Y can subscribe to receive notifications only when more than a specified percentage of document has changed or only when a specified portion e.g. set of sections of the document have change . In some embodiments entity Y can subscribe to receive notifications only when more than a specified percentage of document has changed or only when a specified portion e.g. set of sections of the document has changed.

At the document analysis engine is configured to determine that the portion of the contract has changed. The change in the document can be determined based on historical data stored at the document analysis engine. For example in some embodiments the portion of the contract can be compared with an image e.g. a copy of the portion of the contract stored at the document analysis engine or at a different location by the document analysis engine .

The portion of the contract is analyzed based on a contract template and based on a parsing function at . The contract template and or the parsing function can be retrieved by for example the document analysis engine based on a contract type associated with the portion of the contract.

In some embodiments if a change in the portion of the document is not detected the document may not be analyzed based on the contract template and or based on the parsing function. In other words no action may be taken if a change in the portion of the document is not detected. In some embodiments for example the document analysis engine can be configured to log e.g. record store a date time stamp the processing of the portion of the document and or cache a copy of the document to build a history for future analysis related to changes to the portion of the document.

An action is performed in response to the analysis at . In some embodiments for example a user can be notified of details of the differences between the updated portion of the document and the previous image of the portion of the document or one or more historical copies of the portion of the document . In some embodiments a user can be prevented from later accessing target content associated with the document based on the analysis. In other words the analysis can be stored in a memory and used to block access when the target content is later requested.
