title: Rendering a customized list of controls
abstract: Form controls can be reused so that the control can be bound to large volumes of data without adverse performance issues because of a large number of controls. A maximum number of rows of data N that can appear in a form are calculated. A container in memory is created for N+2 rows. The additional two rows are used to store the row after the last displayed row and the row previous to the first displayed row. In response to a user scroll or tab operation, rows within the container are reused. Child controls are hosted by the control and are also reused when the data is scrolled out of view.
