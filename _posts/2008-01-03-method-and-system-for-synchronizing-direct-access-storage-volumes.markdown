title: Method and system for synchronizing direct access storage volumes
abstract: A method and system for synchronizing direct access storage volumes designated as managed by storage management software with direct access storage volumes available to a computer system. An identifier of a volume is provided. The volume is connected to and available to a computer system, and is not managed by storage management software. A best fit between the identifier and generic identification patterns is determined based on ratings. The database record that includes the best fitting identification pattern is identified. Management options that facilitate managing the volume by the storage management software are retrieved from the database record. The volume is automatically added to a set of volumes being managed by the storage management software. The adding of the volume includes designating the volume as being managed by the storage management software and providing the management options to the storage management software.
