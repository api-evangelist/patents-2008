This disclosure relates to generally to a capture method a technical field of software and or hardware technology and in one example embodiment to pause and replay of media content through bookmarks on a server device.

A user of a client device e.g. a personal computer a mobile phone a network connected television a set top box coupled to a standard television etc. may play a media content e.g. a video content an audio content a multimedia content a textual content etc. that is streamed to the client device from a server device and or a content server through a network e.g. Internet LAN WAN etc. . An owner of the media content may not permit the user to download the media content to the client device for a variety of reasons e.g. copyright license restrictions etc. .

The user of the client device may not be able to view the media content in a single viewing session e.g. because of time constraints . An indicator e.g. a pointer may be stored on a memory buffer e.g. local storage of the client device associated with a location where the user paused a playback of the media content being streamed from the server when the media content is played from a client side media player e.g. Microsoft Windows Media Player Apple QuickTime player Adobe Flash player etc. . However an application e.g. a browser the client side media player etc. of the client device may delete the indicator after occurrence of an event e.g. when the application is closed after a period of time etc. .

Sometimes the user of the client device may wish to use different client devices to finish playing the media content across multiple viewing sessions. When the media content is streamed from the server through the network the user may need to replay the media content in its entirety when they use different client devices to play portions of the media content. The used may waste time in repeatedly viewing portions of the media content that the user has previously seen. In some instances the user may decide not to view the media content at all. As a result the owner of the media content may lose valuable opportunities to distribute the media content through streaming.

A method apparatus and system of pause and replay of media content through bookmarks on a server device are disclosed. In one aspect a method of a server device includes authenticating a user of a client device communicating a media content to the client device through a network processing a pause request of the client device to pause the media content storing a bookmark location indicating a current playback location of the media content in the client device on the server device processing a play request of the user to play the media content from the bookmark location e.g. the play request of the user to play the media content from the bookmark location may be received from a different client device of the user and communicating the media content from the bookmark location to the user.

The media content may be received from a standard content server through the network. The portion of the media content remaining to be communicated to the client device may be copied from the standard content server to the server device based on the bookmark location. The media content remaining to be communicated to the client device may be transmitted from the server device to the client device without involving the standard content server e.g. when the play request of the user to play the media content from the bookmark location is processed by the server device . The portion of the media content remaining to be communicated to the client device may be deleted from the server device e.g. after transmitting the media content when the play request of the user to play the media content from the bookmark location is fulfilled . The media content may broadcast live from the standard content server without storage on the standard content server. The standard content server may aggregate the media content from user generated content communities and or professional media providers. The media content may be at least 3 minutes in length. The pause request of the client device to pause the media content may be stored temporarily on the client device immediately after the user presses a pause indicator on an application of the client device e.g. to reduce an amount of time between when the user presses the pause indicator and when the pause request may be processed by the server device when a client side media player is used to playback the media content . The pause request may include a relative amount of time of a session of viewing the media content on the client device during the session.

The method may continuously buffer on the server device at least a portion of the media content equivalent to an average amount of time of delay between when the user presses the pause indicator on the application of the client device and when the pause request is processed by the server device e.g. such that the server device is able to adjust a location of the bookmark to a relative time phase of when the user pressed the pause indicator on the application of the client device . The user may press the pause indicator through a remote control a voice command a pointing device action and or a tactile command. The media content may be stored in a local storage coupled to the server device.

The media content may be received from an advanced content server through the network. An Application Programming Interface API of the advanced content server may be applied that enables the server device to play the portion of the media content remaining to be communicated to the client device based on the bookmark. The portion of the media content remaining to be communicated to the client device may be played based on the bookmark directly from the advanced content server e.g. when the play request of the user to play the media content from the bookmark location on the server device is processed by the server device . A social community of users may be formed around bookmark locations of different users across different ones of the media content in a community pausing network e.g. such that users of the community pausing network share paused locations of media content with each other through profiles associated with each user of the community pausing network . The user may be automatically authenticated through a unique hardware identifier of the client device. The client device may be a personal computer a mobile phone a network connected television and or a set top box coupled to a standard television.

In another aspect a system includes a client device to playback a media content from a pause location through a bookmark a network and a server device to store the bookmark associated with the pause location and to stream the media content to the client device. A standard content server may transmit the media content being streamed to the server device. The server device may store content from the pause location to a completion point of the media content based on the bookmark e.g. when the standard content server is used to transmit the media . An advanced content server having an Application Programming Interface API may transmit the media content being streamed to the server device. The server device may use the bookmark to reference the pause location directly in the advanced content server. In addition the server device may be used to directly stream the media content from the pause location of the advanced content server e.g. when a play request of the client device to play from the pause location is processed by the server device .

In yet another aspect a method of a server device includes creating a bookmark in response to a pause request of a client device to pause a media content being streamed from the server device and storing the bookmark and other bookmarks associated with pause locations of other users in a server device without duplicating the media content in separate files for each user creating the pause locations on the server device. The pause locations may be shared in user profiles of each of the users creating the pause locations e.g. such that users highlight and comment on pause locations of interest to them to other users . The media content may be pre processed after receiving the media content from a content server external to the server device e.g. such that the pre processing enables a buffering of at least a portion of the media content in the server device prior to transmitting the media content to the client device .
