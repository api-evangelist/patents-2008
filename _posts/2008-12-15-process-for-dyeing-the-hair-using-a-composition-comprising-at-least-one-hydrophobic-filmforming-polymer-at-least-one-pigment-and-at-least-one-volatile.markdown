This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 006 486 filed Jan. 16 2008 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. This application also claims benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 to French Patent Application No. FR 0759814 filed Dec. 13 2007 the contents of which are also incorporated herein by reference.

Disclosed herein is a process for dyeing the hair using at least one hydrophobic film forming polymer and at least one pigment.

It is known practice to dye keratin fibers via various techniques using direct dyes or pigments for non permanent dyeing or dye precursors for permanent dyeing.

Non permanent dyeing or direct dyeing includes dyeing keratin fibers with dye compositions containing direct dyes. These dyes are colored and are coloring molecules that have affinity for keratin fibers. They are applied to the keratin fibers for the time required to obtain the desired coloration and are then rinsed out.

The standard dyes that are used include dyes of the nitrobenzene anthraquinone nitropyridine azo xanthene acridine azine or triarylmethane type or natural dyes.

Some of these dyes may be used under lightening conditions which enables the production of colorations that are visible on dark hair.

It is also known practice to dye keratin fibers permanently via oxidation dyeing. This dyeing technique includes applying to the keratin fibers a composition containing dye precursors such as oxidation bases and couplers. These precursors under the action of an oxidizing agent form at least one colored substance in the hair.

The variety of molecules used as oxidation bases and couplers can allow a wide range of colors to be obtained and the colorations resulting therefrom can be permanent strong and resistant to external agents such as light bad weather washing perspiration and rubbing.

In order to be visible on dark hair these two dyeing techniques generally involve prior or simultaneous bleaching of the keratin fibers. This bleaching step performed with an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide or persalts can result in appreciable degradation of the keratin fibers which impairs their cosmetic properties. The hair then has a tendency to become coarse more difficult to disentangle and more brittle.

Another dyeing method involves using pigments. The use of pigments at the surface of the keratin fibers generally makes it possible to obtain visible colorations on dark hair since the surface pigment masks the natural color of the fiber. The use of pigments for dyeing keratin fibers is described for example in French Patent Application Publication No. FR 2 741 530 which discusses using for the temporary dyeing of keratin fibers a composition comprising at least one dispersion of film forming polymer particles comprising at least one acid functional group and at least one pigment dispersed in the continuous phase of the said dispersion.

The colorations obtained via this dyeing method can have the drawback of having poor resistance to shampoo washing.

It is moreover known practice to produce colored coatings on hair using a composition comprising an electrophilic monomer of cyanoacrylate type and a pigment such as those described in European Patent Application Publication No. EP 1 649 898. Such a composition can allow perfectly coated and non greasy hair to be obtained. However the coating obtained may not be entirely satisfactory with regard to external agents such as washing and perspiration. Moreover the coating obtained is sensitive to fatty substances such as sebum.

Thus there is a need in the art for a process for dyeing keratin fibers such as the hair which makes it possible to obtain colored coatings that can be color fast with respect to shampoo and to the various attacking factors to which hair may be subjected without degrading the keratin fibers and while keeping the hairs as perfectly individualized as possible.

Accordingly one aspect of the present disclosure is a process for dyeing the hair comprising applying to the hair at least one composition comprising at least one hydrophobic film forming polymer at least one pigment and at least one volatile solvent and heating the hair covered with the composition at a temperature above 40 C.

The process as disclosed herein can produce on keratin fibers colored coatings that make it possible to obtain a shampoo fast visible coloration on all hair types while at the same time preserving the physical qualities of the keratin fibers. Such a coating can be resistant to at least one of the external attacking factors to which hair may be subjected such as blow drying and perspiration. It can make it possible for example to obtain a smooth uniform deposit. Moreover it has been observed surprisingly that the hairs can remain individualized and can be styled without problem and that the styling properties afforded to the fibers can be shampoo fast.

The term individualized hairs means hairs which after application of the composition and drying are not stuck together or are separate from each other and therefore do not form clumps of hair since the coating is formed around virtually every hair.

According to the present disclosure the composition comprises at least one hydrophobic film forming polymer at least one pigment and at least one volatile solvent.

For the purposes of the present disclosure the term polymer means a compound corresponding to the repetition of at least one unit these units being derived from compounds known as monomers . These units are repeated at least twice and for example at least three times.

The term hydrophobic polymer means a polymer that has a solubility in water at 25 C. of less than 1 by weight.

The term film forming polymer means a polymer that is capable by itself or in the presence of an auxiliary film forming agent of forming a macroscopically continuous film on a support such as on keratin materials and for example a cohesive film.

For example the polymeric thickener present in the composition according to the present disclosure may be an amorphous polymer formed by polymerization of an olefin. The olefin may be an elastomeric ethylenically unsaturated monomer.

Non limiting examples of olefins that may be mentioned include ethylenic carbide monomers such as those containing one or two ethylenic unsaturations and containing from 2 to 5 carbon atoms such as ethylene propylene butadiene or isoprene.

The polymeric thickener is capable of thickening or gelling the composition. As used herein the term amorphous polymer means a polymer that does not have a crystalline form. The polymeric thickener may also be film forming.

The at least one polymeric thickener may be for example a diblock triblock multiblock radial or star copolymer or mixtures thereof.

Such polymeric thickeners are described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002 005562 and in U.S. Pat. No. 5 221 534.

The polymeric thickener may be hydrogenated to reduce the residual ethylenic unsaturations after the polymerization of the monomers.

For example the polymeric thickener may be an optionally hydrogenated copolymer containing styrene blocks and ethylene C3 C4 alkylene blocks.

Diblock copolymers for example hydrogenated of which non limiting mention may be made include styrene ethylene propylene copolymers and styrene ethylene butadiene copolymers. Diblock polymers are sold for example under the name KRATON G1701E by the company Kraton Polymers.

Triblock copolymers for example hydrogenated of which non limiting mention may be made include styrene ethylene propylene styrene copolymers styrene ethylene butadiene styrene copolymers styrene isoprene styrene copolymers and styrene butadiene styrene copolymers. Triblock polymers are sold for example under the names KRATON G1650 KRATON G1652 KRATON D1101 KRATON D1102 and KRATON D1160 by the company Kraton Polymers.

A mixture of styrene butylene ethylene styrene triblock hydrogenated copolymer and of ethylene propylene styrene hydrogenated star polymer may also be used such a mixture for instance being in isododecane. Such mixtures are sold for example by the company Penreco under the trade names VERSAGEL M5960 and VERSAGEL M5670.

For example a diblock copolymer such as those described previously such as a styrene ethylene propylene diblock copolymer may be used as polymeric thickener.

For example the organophilic clays may be clays modified with chemical compounds that make the clay capable of swelling.

Clays are products that are already well known per se which are described for example in the book Clay mineralogy S. Caill re S. H nin M. Rautureau 2edition 1982 Masson the teaching of which is included herein by way of reference.

Clays are silicates containing a cation that may be chosen from calcium magnesium aluminum sodium potassium and lithium cations and mixtures thereof.

Non limiting examples of such products that may be mentioned include clays of the smectite family such as montmorillonites hectorites bentonites beidellites and saponites and also of the family of vermiculites stevensite and chlorites.

These clays may be of natural or synthetic origin. For example clays that are cosmetically compatible and acceptable with keratin materials may be used.

The organophilic clay may be chosen from montmorillonite bentonite hectorite attapulgite sepiolite and mixtures thereof. The clay may be a bentonite or a hectorite.

These clays may be modified with a chemical compound chosen from quaternary amines tertiary amines amine acetates imidazolines amine soaps fatty sulfates alkyl aryl sulfonates amine oxides and mixtures thereof.

Organophilic clays of which non limiting mention may be made include quaternium 18 bentonites such as those sold under the names BENTONE 3 BENTONE38 and BENTONE 38V by the company Rheox TIXOGEL VP by the company United Catalyst CLAYTONE 34 CLAYTONE 40 and CLAYTONE XL by the company Southern Clay stearalkonium bentonites such as those sold under the names BENTONE 27 by the company Rheox TIXOGEL LG by the company United Catalyst and CLAYTONE AF and CLAYTONE APA by the company Southern Clay quaternium 18 benzalkonium bentonites such as those sold under the names CLAYTONE HT and CLAYTONE PS by the company Southern Clay.

The fumed silicas may be obtained by high temperature hydrolysis of a volatile silicon compound in an oxhydric flame producing a finely divided silica. This process makes it possible to obtain hydrophilic silicas having a large number of silanol groups at their surface. Such hydrophilic silicas are sold for example under the names AEROSIL 130 AEROSIL 200 AEROSIL 255 AEROSIL 300 and AEROSIL 380 by the company Degussa and CAB O SIL HS 5 CAB O SIL EH 5 CAB O SIL LM 130 CAB O SIL MS 55 and CAB O SIL M 5 by the company Cabot.

It is possible to chemically modify the surface of the silica via a chemical reaction generating a reduction in the number of silanol groups. It is for example possible to substitute silanol groups with hydrophobic groups a hydrophobic silica is then obtained.

The fumed silica for example has a particle size that may be nanometric to micrometric for example ranging from 5 to 200 nm.

The at least one thickener is present in the composition in a total amount ranging from 0.1 to 10 by weight for example ranging from 0.5 to 7 by weight and such as ranging from 1 to 5 by weight relative to the total weight of the composition.

The compositions in accordance with the present disclosure may also contain at least one adjuvant chosen for example from reducing agents fatty substances softeners antifoams moisturizers UV screening agents mineral colloids peptizers solubilizers fragrances anionic cationic nonionic or amphoteric surfactants proteins vitamins propellants oxyethylenated or non oxyethylenated waxes paraffins C10 C30 fatty acids such as stearic acid or lauric acid and C10 C30 fatty amides such as lauric diethanolamide.

The at least one adjuvant can be present in an amount for each of them ranging from 0.01 to 20 by weight relative to the weight of the composition.

Needless to say a person skilled in the art will take care to select this or these optional ingredient s such that the beneficial properties intrinsically associated with the formation of the coating in accordance with the present disclosure are not or are not substantially adversely affected.

The composition according to the present disclosure may be in for example the form of a suspension a dispersion a solution a gel an emulsion such as an oil in water O W or water in oil W O emulsion or a multiple emulsion W O W or polyol O W or O W O in the form of a cream a mousse a stick a dispersion of vesicles for example of ionic or nonionic lipids a two phase or multi phase lotion a spray a powder or a paste. The composition may also be in the form of a lacquer.

A person skilled in the art can select the appropriate galenical form and also the method for preparing it on the basis of his general knowledge taking into account firstly the nature of the constituents used such as their solubility in the support and also the intended use of the composition.

The composition may be an anhydrous composition i.e. a composition containing less than 2 by weight of water or even less than 0.5 water for example free of water the water not being added during the preparation of the composition but corresponding to the residual water provided by the mixed ingredients.

The composition described above may be used on wet or dry hair and also on any type of fair or dark natural or dyed permanent waved bleached or relaxed hair.

According to at least one embodiment of the process of the present disclosure the hair is washed before application of the composition described above.

The application to the hair may be performed for example using a comb a fine brush a coarse brush or the fingers.

The application of the composition is then followed by drying at a temperature above 40 C. According to at least one embodiment of the present disclosure this temperature is greater than 45 C. According to at least one embodiment of the present disclosure this temperature is greater than 45 C. and less than 220 C.

Drying may be performed immediately after the application or after a leave on time that may range from 1 minute to 30 minutes.

For example in addition to supplying heat the hair may be dried using a flow of air. This flow of air during drying makes it possible to improve the individualization of the coating.

During drying a mechanical action on the locks may be exerted such as combing brushing or passing the fingers through.

The drying of the process of the present disclosure may be performed for example with a hood a hairdryer a smoothing iron a Climazon etc.

When the drying is performed with a hood or a hairdryer the drying temperature ranges from 40 to 110 C. for example from 50 to 90 C.

When the drying step is performed with a smoothing iron the drying temperature ranges from 110 to 220 C. for example from 140 to 200 C.

Other than in the examples or where otherwise indicated all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients reaction conditions and so forth used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term about. Accordingly unless indicated to the contrary the numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present disclosure. At the very least and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims each numerical parameter should be construed in light of the number of significant digits and ordinary rounding approaches.

Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the disclosure are approximations unless otherwise indicated the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value however inherently contains certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements.
