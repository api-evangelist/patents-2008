This application is a divisional application of U.S. application Ser. No. 11 043 091 filed Jan. 27 2005 the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.

This application is related to Replacement Solvents Having Improved Properties and Methods of Using the Same filed on even date which serial number is Ser. No. 12 192 229.

This invention disclosed herein was made with funding from the United States Air Force pursuant to Contract Number F04611 01 C 0025. The United States Government may have certain rights under this invention.

Chlorofluorocarbons CFC s are widely used solvents for precision cleaning of parts and components due to their superior physical and chemical properties especially their solvency for contaminating materials such as oils greases resin fluxes particulates and other contaminates. One solvent commonly used in many applications is CFC 113 1 1 2 trichloro 1 2 2 trifluoroethane . These solvents are used to clean and or degrease components or systems related to but not limited to oxygen handling systems refrigeration equipments or heat pumps electronics implantable prosthetic devices and optical equipment. In addition these solvents have been used as a means to measure residue remaining is a system. For example in Air Force launch vehicle applications involving liquid or gaseous oxygen systems CFC 113was the solvent of choice used to detect and quantify the amount of hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon residues in these systems since the presence of those contaminants can be catastrophic. A further application of these solvents is for foam blowing and polymer coating.

CFC 113has many favorable characteristics such as low toxicity non flammability and stability. Furthermore CFC 113is not classified as an air polluting volatile organic compounds VOC s by environmental regulators is practically odorless and has a high worker exposure threshold value eliminating the need for costly air circulation or dilution precautions. These benefits also came at a low price less than 1 of total manufacturing costs in 1988 . Coupled with the growth of the electronics industry and concerns over worker safety due to toxic chemical exposure and hazardous waste disposal resulting from the use of VOC s the desirable characteristics led to the widespread use of CFC 113.

With the rise of electronic equipment during the 1970s the need to properly clean these contaminant sensitive parts became very important and the solvent 1 1 2 trichloro 1 2 2 trifluoroethane CFC 113 was found to be an excellent and versatile solvent. Being able to dissolve an unusually large array of contaminants greases oils etc and having excellent physical characteristics CFC 113became the solvent of choice for electronics cleaning and it s use spread to other applications especially military. Specifically CFC 113was used to remove solder flux from small spaces between electronic components so as to ensure adhesion of coatings and prevent corrosion and electromigration of ions. Even more favorable were the non aggressive properties of CFC 113towards most polymers and coatings and its use permitted a wide use of plastics and other solvent sensitive materials in the manufacture of electronic components. By 1986 the removal of solder flux from printed circuit board assemblies accounted for close to half of worldwide CFC 113 consumption. A significant portion of the remaining half was utilized by the military and in particular aviation.

The use of CFC 113 however is restricted due to the Montreal Protocol due to its ability to react and deplete atmospheric ozone. By the Mid 1980s problems regarding the ozone became apparent and the primary culprits were certain halogenated hydrocarbons including CFC 113. In 1987 twenty four nations agreed in principle to control ozone depleting substances ODS such as CFC 113Although this solvent had become critical to the electronics industry the importance of protecting the earth s ozone layer weighed heavier. Thus non toxic and non ozone depleting replacement solvents became a priority for electronics manufacturers and the military. Various CFC 113substitutes have emerged and often rely on solvents such as n propyl bromide and dichloroethylene which are flammable and not as desirable as CFC 113.

Refrigeration systems also require periodic flushing to remove contaminants. A contaminated refrigeration system may have drastically reduced performance resulting from compressor failure for example. The materials and contaminants in these systems differ from other applications and therefore solvents must be optimized accordingly. For example a flushing solvent must be compatible with the elastomers and metals in typical systems while at the same time have the solvency properties to remove oils acids and decomposition products of the oils and refrigerants. Some of the currently used flushing solvents include terpenes e.g. d limonene n propyl bromide pentafluorobutane HCFC 141b and HCFC 225ca cb.

Selection for CFC replacements typically involves two steps. First commercially available materials with limited impact on the environment are selected these are termed next generation replacements. These next generation replacements are interim and do not have all the desired properties of an ideal replacement e.g. they are not as effective solvents or have non zero ozone depletion potentials or ODP . The second step is to evaluate the so called second generation replacements that are not commercially available but are only available in research quantities or by custom synthesis and have properties that are not known. Evaluation and manipulation e.g. by mixing of these candidate second generation solvents will result in second generation replacements that meet or exceed the next generation solvents overall performance since all critical properties required of the solvent are accounted for.

Many factors are important when selecting CFC second generation replacement solvents. Some of the critical performance properties for a second generation CFC replacements include cleaning effectiveness or solvency volatility e.g. Boiling point compatibility with materials to be cleaned e.g. metals elastomers and systems toxicity e.g. LC50 LD50 cardiac sensitization mutagenicity skin irritation environmental persistence e.g. ozone depletion potential ODP global warming potential GWP tropospheric lifetime TLT biodegradability flammability e.g. autogenous ignition temperature AIT flash point cost and availability.

The solvency of the replacement should be comparable to CFC so the primary factor of performance is not compromised. The volatility and materials compatibility of the replacement solvent should be similar to the CFC so there is minimal impact on existing cleaning systems by switching solvents. Hazardous risks such as flammability toxicity and environmental impact are also critical since every manufacturer will be required to eliminate hazardous solvents in the near future.

The solvency performance of the candidate replacements can be quantified through the solubility parameter of the compounds. The hazard potential of the candidate replacements can be characterized using toxicity information such as lethal doses LD lethal concentrations LC or threshold limit values TLV and flammability information. Environmental properties can be analyzed through ozone depletion potential ODP global warming potential GWP and tropospheric lifetime TLT . For a discussion of these parameters and their measurements or calculations see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 300 378 to Tapscott. Volatility can be assessed using the normal boiling point nBP of the solvent. If all of these properties and others can be experimentally measured or modeled one could identify and test non hazardous drop in replacement solvents to replace hazardous solvents. The following paragraphs discuss the relevance of these performance parameters.

The solubility parameter is a very important measure of the cleaning effectiveness of a solvent in dissolving and removing another material. In general these parameters provide an easy numerical method of rapidly predicting the extent of interaction between materials particularly liquids. Compounds with similar solubility parameters are known by those skilled in the art to have similar solvency properties. For example CFC 113has a solubility parameter or about 7.5which is within the range where a solvent will dissolve both hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon greases. This is a fairly unique solubility parameter and is a major part of what makes CFC 113such an excellent solvent. It also makes the substitution for CFC 113rather difficult.

A quantitative method for comparing the relative solubility of different materials is through the use of solubility parameters. This concept of expressing solubility is based on the idea that the solution of one material in another is a spontaneous process and that it can be stated in terms of the free energy of mixing as shown below 1 where G is the free energy of mixing H is the enthalpy of mixing and S is the entropy of mixing. The controlling term for a spontaneous process where G is negative is the enthalpy of mixing which can be expressed in terms of xand x the mole fraction of the components Vand V the molar volumes and aand a the interaction constants.

The above expression shows that the solubility parameter of a compound can be calculated directly from the latent heat of vaporization and the molar volume of the compound if these are available. Regardless of the method of determination solubility parameters are useful in comparing the solvency of compounds because solvents with similar solubility parameters are known by those skilled in the art to have similar solvency properties.

For reference the solubility parameter in cal cm for some common compounds are water 23.37 acetone 9.646 ethyl alcohol 12.779 HFC 134a 8.067 propane 6.404 hexane 7.284 benzene 9.142 isopropyl alcohol 11.450 and d limonene 8.243.

The volatility of a replacement solvent can be described in terms of properties such as the normal boiling point nBP . An effective solvent replacement must be volatile enough to evaporate but should not flash off of surfaces since the solvent must reside on the contaminants long enough to dissolve them. An nBP around 40 C. or higher is generally acceptable for cleaning applications.

Material and system compatibility is another requirement for a second generation solvent. The solvent must be compatible with metals such as aluminum copper carbon steel and stainless steel as well as elastomers. The solvent should not degrade or corrode surfaces in the system being cleaned. The solvent also needs to be compatible with the particular system application. For example a solvent to be used for cleaning oxygen handling system must be compatible with liquid and gaseous oxygen. In this case tests such as ASTM G86for ignition sensitivity to mechanical impact must be considered.

Whether a solvent is suitable as cleaning solvents for systems e.g. oxygen handling systems is partially dependent upon its flammability which sometimes is quantified by the autogenous ignition temperatures AIT . AIT provides a measure of the material s relative ease of ignition and indicates the approximate temperature at which a material could be expected to spontaneously ignite in high pressure oxygen. This test is typically performed per ASTM Method G72. A rating system has been established by the NASA White Sands Test Facility and Wright Patterson Air Force Base. By this system compounds are classified as A not recommended AIT

Another aspect of the flammability determination is the flashpoint of the solvent. The flashpoint is the temperature at which a liquid gives off vapor sufficient to form an ignitable mixture with air oxygen near the surface of the liquid. The ideal replacement solvent should not have a flashpoint below or at its boiling point. This insures a wide range of conditions whereby the solvent can be safely used.

The environmental persistence of a solvent is also very important. Parameters such as the ozone depletion potential ODP global warming potential GWP and tropospheric lifetime TLT are measures of this attribute. ODP and GWP give the relative ability by weight of a chemical to deplete stratospheric ozone and to contribute to global warming respectively. Values for ODP GWP and TLT are calculated based on an earth surface release and then reported relative to a reference compound typically CFC 11or ODP and CFC 11or carbon dioxide for GWP . Generally the ODP should be less than 0.02 and the GWP and TLT should be minimized preferably lower than the solvent being replaced.

The biochemical oxygen demand BOD is also another measure of persistence typically in groundwater lakes and other bodies of water.

Toxicity is yet another factor which must be considered when selecting second generation replacement solvents. Parameters such as the lethal dose 50 LD50 lethal concentration 50 LC50 cardiac sensitization skin irritation and mutagenicity e.g. via the Ames test can be used as measures. LDn or LCn abbreviation where n is the percent lethality is used for the dose of a toxicant lethal to n of a test population. For instance at LD50 50 of the recipients of that particular toxic dose would die. Cardiac sensitization is a measure of the ability of a compound to cause cardiac arrhythmia under stress. Generally it is desired to minimize these parameters and select compounds that have lower values than the solvent that is being replaced.

The CFC 113replacements known in prior art do not address all of the required second generation solvent properties. CFC 113replacements and solvents that address ozone depletion have been introduced and are disclosed in e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 035 828 6 402 857 6 297 308 and 6 020 298. Various solvents and solvent mixtures are disclosed which have low ODPs. These replacement solvents however do not possess all of the desired properties of CFC 113such as flammability toxicity oxygen compatibility and cleaning effectiveness.

In U.S. Pat. No. 5 035 828 HCFC 234is combined with an aliphatic alcohol or cyclohexane but this mixture is easily flammable. U.S. Pat. No. 6 402 857 utilizes n propyl bromide with other organic constituents which are also flammable and have a significant adverse impact on ozone. U.S. Pat. No. 6 020 298utilizes hydrofluoropolyethers and U.S. Pat. No. 6 297 308utilizes halogenated ethers and hydrocarbons with a surfactant. While these solvents appear to avoid damage to the ozone layer the perfluorinated compounds contained therein are known to be potent greenhouse gases. In addition perfluorinated and fluorinated no chlorine solvents are undesirable as they can have widely varying solubility properties and different interactions with organic residues when compared to CFC 113.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 103 684teaches the use of azeotrope like mixtures comprised of 1 bromopropane with non halogenated alcohols and alkanes as well as halogenated alkanes and fluorinated ethers. The ODP for 1 bromopropane is stated as being between 0.002and 0.03 classifying it as a Class II Ozone Depleting Substance. The flammability limits of 1 bromopropane are 2.7 9.2 in air with an auto ignition temperature of 490 C. In addition the solubility parameter of 1 bromopropane is also 8.839 too high to effectively dissolve many greases and oils. Furthermore the alcohols and alkanes of this invention are also flammable.

In U.S. Pat. No. 6 048 832 the inventors disclose the use of 1 bromopropane with 4 methoxy 1 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 nonafluorobutane an ether and at least one other non halogenated organic compound. As in U.S. Pat. No. 6 103 684 the use of 1 bromopropane is questionable due to its high ODP flammability and undesirable solubility parameter. The other components such as ethanol and 2 propanol also have high solubility parameters of about 11 13 thereby decreasing the usefulness of these mixtures for a broad spectrum of contaminants as will be taught by the present invention.

Solvents that meet the environmental restrictions and are non flammable are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 300 378and 5 759 430and in Tapscott Mather 2000 Tropodegradable fluorocarbon replacements for ozone depleting and global warming chemicals. J. Fluorine Chemistry 101 209 213. Compounds disclosed therein are generally non flammable and or non ozone depleting as they are tropodegradable fluorocarbons defined as compounds having structural weaknesses to ensure rapid decay in the troposphere. When this class of compounds is exposed to sunlight photolysis or chemical radicals e.g. hydroxyls in the atmosphere they decay into forms that do not damage the ozone layer nor contribute to the greenhouse effect. The structural weaknesses can take such forms as hydrogen being present on the molecule a carbon carbon double bond that is vulnerable to reactions an ether bond or a bromine atom being present for easy degradation. These structural vulnerabilities render the molecules unstable and within a fairly short period of time they break down and are no longer part of the atmosphere. These references however fail to teach solvents with optimized solubility parameters together with desirable toxicity and material compatibility. Specifically these references do not suggest any advantages of using chlorine containing ethers.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 273 592discloses partially fluorinated ethers having a tertiary structure for solvent cleaning. The benefits of combining partially fluorinated ethers with hydrofluorochloro ethers HFCE s or hydrobromochlorofluoro alkenes HBCFA s for solvent applications are not suggested.

U.S. Pat. No. 4 999 127teaches an azeotropic mixture of CHF CClF O CHF trans 1 2 dichloroethylene and methanol. Some components of this mixture are toxic and flammable and hence not desirable as a safe second generation solvent replacement.

In short the prior art has taught replacements to CFC s which only partially meet the requirements of a second generation solvent. There is thus a need for second generation replacement solvents that possess all required performance parameters.

This invention provides second generation solvents that possess all important performance properties including 

We have discovered that mixtures of certain halogenated compounds can meet or exceed the performance properties of CFC s and in particular CFC 113These solvent mixtures comprise two or more compounds selected from hydrofluorochloro ethers HFCE s hydrobromochlorofluoro alkenes HBCFA s hydrofluoro ethers HFE s and halogenated alkanes alcohols diones acetates ketones e.g. butanones pentanones esters e.g. propanoates anhydrides cycloalkanes cycloparaffins cycloalkenes cycloolefins heterocyclics e.g. furans and aromatics. Many of these compounds have been ignored in the past based on an incomplete evaluation and assumption of generalities pertaining to performance properties. Our approach to identifying these optimal solvent mixtures utilized quantitative structure property relations QSPR s and a complex ranking scheme to objectively and completely evaluate numerous potential candidates and numerous properties required to meet the performance of CFC solvents. Many of the compounds and mixtures discovered through this process are novel and have not been considered in the prior art.

The mixtures taught by this invention comprise compounds which are non flammable as measured by flashpoint and AIT testing have ODP s of less than about 0.02 and have solubility parameters within about 10 of CFC 113. The boiling points of these components and mixtures are also greater than about 40 C. to make them useful in most solvent applications with toxicities less than or similar to CFC 113. We have also found that these components and mixtures are compatible with most elastomers and metals.

One object of the present invention is to teach CFC solvent replacements comprising at least two tropodegradable components that act collectively to meet or exceed the cleaning effectiveness or solvency of the CFC targeted for replacement have ODP values less than about 0.02 have boiling points greater than about 40 C. have toxicities less than or similar to the CFC targeted for replacement have no flash point up to their boiling point have autogenous ignition temperature classifications of B or C and be compatible with common elastomers and metals.

The present invention further discloses that certain brominated compounds can be included in solvent mixtures to affect solvency properties so as to perform similar to or better than the CFC targeted for replacement. These brominated compounds are known to offer reductions in flammability but we have discovered surprisingly that they also offer effective CFC solvency enhancement when combined with other compounds.

It has also been surprising discovered that mixtures of certain compounds can effectively increase the solvency range for certain common contaminants e.g. hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon greases oils decomposition products when compared to the CFCs targeted for replacement.

In another aspect this invention shows that compounds that have generally been used as anesthetics are excellent solvents which possess minimal or well characterized toxicity.

Yet another object of this invention is to teach the use of second generation solvent mixtures to clean and or degrease components or systems related to but not limited to oxygen handling systems refrigeration systems or heat pumps electronics implantable prosthetic devices and optical equipments.

In a preferred embodiment solvent mixtures of the present invention are compatible with liquid oxygen handling systems especially with regard to ignition sensitivity to mechanical impact in liquid oxygen.

A related object of this invention is to teach alternative CFC compositions suitable for foam blowing and applying coatings.

An additional object of this invention is to teach the general methods by which second generation solvents can be specified to replace not only CFC s but also future compounds which will be banned from use such as hydrochlorofluorocarbons HCFC s and hydrobromofluorocarbons HBFC s .

Table 1lists compounds derived using the methods of the present invention. Compounds listed therein have boiling points greater than 40 C. ODP values less than about 0.02 a solubility parameter within a range of about 10 of CFC 113 a CS value greater than or equal to 80 of the CFC 113value and TLT s less than that of CFC 113. In Table 1 CS CSrefers to cardiac sensitization CS a measure of inhalation toxicity of the compound relative to CFC 113with a predicted value of 1090ppm and SP is the solubility parameter. The values for this selected group of solvent properties are shown with CFC 113as reference. Five more preferred compounds of this invention are denoted by the letters A though E in the table. The underlined numbers in Table 1are experimental values. Others are predictions from quantitative structure property relations QSPR s see below illustrating the necessity of using QSPR s as taught by this invention to compare and evaluate a large list of second generation candidates.

Table 2summarizes some of the preferred compounds and their boiling points and solubility parameters relative to CFC 113.

The solvent CFC 113 1 1 2 trichloro 1 2 2 trifluoroethane had been the solvent of choice for many applications until the mid 1980 s. Due to its phase out alternative solvents with similar overall properties have been sought. Those skilled in the art have attempted to find replacements with some success believing that because CFC 113possess so many desirable properties that must be matched a replacement solvent must sacrifice or comprise on some performance properties.

Using a novel and heretofore never suggested approach the inventors of the present invention first developed a comprehensive list of candidate replacements meeting key performance properties and then tested these individual components as replacements. This approach is completely objective and unbiased by previously untested assumptions or generalities related to certain classes of compounds.

As a consequence the inventors of the present invention discovered as have others that a single component replacement cannot meet all of the performance requirements of most first generation solvents most notably solvency. Our focus then turned to mixtures of compounds which possessed a difference in solubility parameter in order to increase the solubility range for the second generation solvent. It is by this process that we discovered certain synergies when combining these solvents. The general process by which we made this discovery is described below.

We considered a total of about 800compounds. The compounds included halogenated alcohols halogenated alkenes halogenated amines halogenated aromatics halogenated carbonyls halogenated ethers halogenated alkanes halogenated heterocyclics halogenated cycloalkanes cycloparaffins and halogenated cycloalkenes cycloolefins . The list of potential second generation CFC solvent replacements was then mathematically analyzed to arrive at a list of compounds which simultaneously met the performance requirements for solvency boiling point and toxicity for a second generation replacement to CFC 113. A mathematical database of properties critical to solvent function was tabulated with this large list of potential second generation solvents. If literature or experimental values for the performance properties were not available we developed quantitative structure property relations QSPR s to model and predict the particular property which was then included in the database table. Those skilled in the art will understand the usefulness and accuracy of QSPR s in the development of products such as environmentally friendly chemicals and pharmaceuticals. This overall method of objectively selecting compounds by considering a large number of constraining performance properties can be used for a variety of applications whereby target properties of the first generation solvent are known.

As stated previously there are several critical performance properties which must be considered when prescribing solvent replacements. These properties include 

Of the properties listed above those having primary significance in selecting a second generation replacement are the solvency volatility toxicity and environmental persistence. More specifically an acceptable second generation solvent should generally have boiling points greater than about 40 C. ODP values less than about 0.02 high LD50values greater than about 5g kg and solubility parameters within about 10 of CFC 113. Other toxicity measures e.g. cardiac sensitization or CS mutagenicity skin irritation and inhalation LC50 should be minimized with respect to the compounds targeted for replacement. The remaining properties of compatibility and flammability are also important and were measured for several compounds meeting the solvency volatility toxicity and environmental persistence requirements. Table 1shows a summary of numerous compounds resulting from the process described above which met these important performance properties. The values in underlined are experimental data whereas the other values are QSPR model predictions. CFC 113properties are shown on line 1of Table 1for comparison.

In general the compounds of Table 1are halogenated acetates alcohols alkanes alkenes anhydrides aromatics cycloalkanes cycloalkenes diones esters ethers heterocyclics or ketones with or without the heteroatom bromine. Aside from these compounds meeting the other required properties for CFC 113 replacement the presence of bromine also has the effect of reducing flammability although this invention does not require a bromine atom be present to reduce flammability. We have found that the compounds most useful for second generation solvent replacements of CFC 113have the following chemical formula CHBrClFO where q 3 10 r 0 11 x 0 1 y 0 2 z 1 and p 0 3. Many of these compounds belong to the classes of hydrofluorochloro ethers HFCE s hydrobromofluorochloro alkenes HBFCA s and hydrofluoro ethers HFE s . This formula also incorporates compounds in the families of alkanes alcohols diones acetates ketones e.g. butanones pentanones esters e.g. propanoates anhydrides cycloalkanes cycloparaffins cycloalkenes cycloolefins heterocyclics e.g. furans and aromatics. As illustrated in Table 1 all of them meet the performance requirements detailed in this invention.

Some of the ethers we have identified to be suitable solvent replacements include 1 chloro 2 2 2 trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether 2 chloro 1 1 2 trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether methyl 2 2 2 trifluoroethyl 1 trifluoromethyl ether fluoromethyl 2 2 2 trifluoro 1 trifluoromethyl ethyl ether methyl 1 1 2 2 3 3 hexafluoropropyl ether bis 2 2 2 trifluoroethyl ether 2 chloro 1 1 2 trifluoroethyl ethyl ether difluoromethyl 2 2 3 3 tetrafluoropropyl ether difluoromethyl 1 chloro 2 2 2 trifluoroethyl ether 2 2 2 trifluoroethyl 2 bromo 2 2 difluoroethyl ether and ethyl 1 1 2 2 tetrafluoroethyl ether.

Using the further restriction of cost and availability on the compounds we identified in Table 1 some of the preferred compounds of this invention that are viable CFC 113replacements including 

Compound B above is also known as isoflurane and compound C is known as enflurane both common anesthetics. These preferred compounds of our invention for CFC 113replacements have boiling points greater than about 40 C. solubility parameters within about 10 of CFC 113 ODP values less than about 0.02 lower TLT and GWP than CFC 113 and minimal toxicity lower than that of CFC 113. Of particular utility in this invention are HFCE s previously overlooked by those skilled in the art when combined with other halogenated ethers and or halogenated alkenes. The use of anesthetics compounds also has advantages in that they have been thoroughly tested for toxicity by the medical community and these compounds will be more easily and more quickly accepted as alternative solvents.

Note that the ODP for CFC 113is much higher than 0.02 classifying it as a Class II Ozone Depleting Substance. The GWP and TLT of CFC 113are also 5000 and 0.9 respectively. The toxicity of CFC 113is also typically higher than those compounds shown in Table 1. Some of the compounds identified by this approach and listed in Table 1have many properties improved over CFC 113while having the same or similar solvency properties e.g. solubility parameter within 10 of CFC 113 .

We then proceeded to verify the primary performance properties e.g. solvency toward different contaminants such as oils and greases of the compounds specified by this invention. The solvency properties of the compounds taught by this invention have been verified for compounds typically found in applications such as oxygen handling systems and refrigeration system flushing. For example certain oils greases and cleaners such as Mil spec 83232hydraulic oil Mil spec 7808engine oil Mil spec 81322hydrocarbon grease Krytox and Simple Green are used in oxygen handling systems. The compounds listed above have been found to dissolve some of these contaminants and when used in mixtures a broader range of contaminant types can be dissolved.

We then discovered that although some of these replacements identified and listed in Table 1can meet or exceed some of the performance properties of CFC 113 the solvency toward a variety of greases and contaminants was inferior to CFC 113 and other single component second generation compounds. Further we discovered that by combining 2or more of these identified compounds solvent blends can be tailored to provide optimized solvency toward a range of contaminant types. In fact the combination of 2or more solvents can provide improved solvency toward contaminants such as greases and oils since the solvency range can be extended or broadened when compared to a single compound. This also suggests that synergies exist when combining compounds identified in this invention would not have been expected if considering only the individual components of the mixture It must also be recognized that the solvency of the 2or more compounds comprising the solvent must be similar otherwise the 2or more components will not be soluble in each other.

The advantage of using mixtures which increase the solubility range of the solvent replacement can be appreciated when considering the solubility parameters. The solubility parameter of CFC 113is 7.2. The solubility parameter necessary to dissolve both fluorocarbon and hydrocarbon grease in oxygen systems has been found to be somewhere between 7.5and 7.7In general values less than 7.5favors dissolution of fluorocarbon but not hydrocarbon greases whereas values in excess of 7.7tend to favor the opposite. Hence the advantages to using the approach taught by this invention provides for improved and more versatile solvents that can not only dissolve a wide range of contaminant types but they also meet the many other requirements placed on solvents such as environmental persistence toxicity and material compatibility. For example by combining the two compounds A. 4 bromo 3 chloro 3 4 4 trifluoro 1 butene and B. 1 chloro 2 2 2 trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether aka isoflurane the solubility parameter will still be between the values 7.65and 7.7and is shown to effectively dissolve both types of grease contaminants in an oxygen handling system.

We then proceeded to characterize other properties such as compatibility flash point and autogenous ignition temperature. We discovered that contrary to commonly held beliefs it is not necessary for the compound or the mixture to contain bromine heteroatoms in order to possess desirable flammability properties. In fact some of the tested compounds exhibited AIT temperatures categorized as C or recommended for oxygen systems. We have also discovered that several of the compounds we have identified using the methods taught by this invention also have no flashpoints up to the boiling point of the compound.

This invention also teaches that a bromine containing compound is not necessary for the mixtures of this invention to limit or eliminate flammability but rather these bromine containing compounds were identified by the mere virtue of their solubility parameter and other properties that have made them suitable in mixtures as replacements for CFC 113.

In using the methods taught by this invention we have also discovered that a particularly preferred solvent replacements for CFC 113based on solvency ODP boiling point and toxicity are those with 1bromine atom. Compounds with multiple Br atoms were considered by the methods taught in this invention but these compounds could not meet most of the required performance properties. Hence we conclude that compounds containing more than one bromine atom will most likely be unsuitable as CFC 113replacements.

We have also discovered that many of the compounds identified have similar or better LD mutagenicity and genotoxicity relative to CFC 113. Hence combinations of these compounds will likewise have similar or better toxicity profiles. For example the compounds 4 bromo 3 chloro 3 4 4 trifluoro 1 butene 1 chloro 2 2 2trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether 2 chloro 1 1 2 trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether and methyl 2 2 2 trifluoroethyl 1 trifluoromethyl ether have LDvalues of 40g kg 8.1g kg 13g kg and 40g kg respectively compared to CFC 113which has a value of 43g kg all values being in a range considered to be a relatively low toxicity. These same compounds also have been found to be negative for the Ames mutagenicity assay and not genotoxic using in vitro Chinese hamster oocytes. CFC 113also is reported negative for the Ames test. Skin irritation is also an important consideration for a solvent. The compounds 4 bromo 3 chloro 3 4 4 trifluoro 1 butene 1 chloro 2 2 2trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether 2 chloro 1 1 2 trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether and methyl 2 2 2 trifluoroethyl 1 trifluoromethyl ether have been tested and determined to be a moderate to non irritants whereas CFC 113is listed as a mild irritant. Hence this invention offers improvement in some categories of toxicity compared to CFC 113. Some of the ether compounds of this invention are also used as anesthetics or anesthetic intermediates and consequently have undergone a considerable amount of toxicity testing by the medical community.

Solvents used in oxygen handling systems more particularly liquid oxygen system must not pose any risks caused by mechanical impact. We have found that many of the compounds taught by this invention can be combined to produce a mixture that is liquid oxygen compatible solvent even when the individual components may not be compatible. For example the compound A 4 bromo 3 chloro 3 4 4 trifluoro 1 butene does not pass ASTM G86for ignition sensitivity to mechanical impact in liquid oxygen but when combined with the compound B 1 chloro 2 2 2 trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether at 25 to 50 4 bromo 3 chloro 3 4 4 trifluoro 1 butene the mixture passes the impact test. This result and the observed synergy were unexpected.

Furthermore many of the compounds taught by this invention and found to posses superior solvency properties have previously been used as anesthetics or are intermediates to producing anesthetics. These compounds have been extensively tested for toxicity and mutagenicity and pose minimal risk with regard to health. Examples of these halogenated ether compounds include but are not limited to isoflurane enflurane desflurane sevoflurane and methoxyflurane. We have also found that the anesthetics isoflurane 1 chloro 2 2 2 difluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether enflurane 2 chloro 1 1 2 trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether sevoflurane fluoromethyl 2 2 2 trifluoro 1 trifluoromethyl ethyl ether and methyl 2 2 2 trifluoroethyl 1 trifluoromethyl ether an intermediate in the production of sevoflurane have additional advantages with respect to solvency and boiling point. These compounds have not been previously considered as solvents in combination with other compounds.

Furthermore we have discovered that many of the compounds which exhibited the best cleaning performance were compounds having a linear structure with a non polar portion of the molecule on one end and a high electron density on the other or having a highly branched structure or having a very asymmetric structure. This feature could result from either branching on one end or large halogen molecules on one end. Example compounds with these characteristics are 4 bromo 3 3 4 4 tetrafluoro 1 butene 4 bromo 3 chloro 3 4 4 trifluoro 1 butene and methyl 2 2 2 trifluoroethyl 1 trifluoromethyl ether. Many of the other compounds listed in Table 1 for example exhibit these features.

One preferred embodiment of this invention are solvents blends comprised of 4 bromo 3 chloro 3 4 4 trifluoro 1 butene and 1 chloro 2 2 2 difluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether where the weight percentage of 4 bromo 3 chloro 3 4 4 trifluoro 1 butene in the mixture varies between about 5wt. and about 75wt. . We have found that combinations of these 2solvents provide exceptional cleaning performance in several applications including oxygen handling systems cleaning and refrigeration system flushing.

A sample comprising 25volume percent A. 4 bromo 3 chloro 3 4 4 trifluoro 1 butene and 75volume percent B. 1 chloro 2 2 2 trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether was added to several beakers each containing a metal coupon completely coated with one of the following materials Mil Spec 83282hydraulic oil Mil Spec 7808engine oil Krytox fluorocarbon grease and Mil Spec 81322aviation grease. Two batches were subjected to 15minute immersion with 15mL of solvent mixture but one was exposed to ultrasonic vibrations and the other kept static. Afterwards the coupons were removed and weighed for gravimetric analysis. Results presented as percent contaminant removed are shown in Table 2 below.

A sample comprising 50volume percent A. 4 bromo 3 chloro 3 4 4 trifluoro 1 butene and 50volume percent B. 1 chloro 2 2 2 trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether was added to several beakers each containing a metal coupon completely coated with one of the following materials Mil Spec 83282hydraulic oil Mil Spec 7808engine oil Krytox fluorocarbon grease and Mil Spec 81322aviation grease. Two batches were subjected to 15minute immersion with 15. mL of solvent mixture but one was exposed to ultrasonic vibrations and the other kept static. Afterwards the coupons were removed and weighed for gravimetric analysis. Results presented as percent contaminant removed are shown in Table 3below.

A sample comprising 75volume percent A. 4 bromo 3 chloro 3 4 4 trifluorobutene and 25volume percent B. 1 chloro 2 2 2trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether was added to several beakers each containing a metal coupon completely coated with one of the following materials Mil Spec 83282hydraulic oil Mil Spec 7808engine oil Krytox fluorocarbon grease and Mil Spec 81322aviation grease. Two batches were subjected to 15minute immersion with 15mL of solvent mixture but one was exposed to ultrasonic vibrations and the other kept static. Afterwards the coupons were removed and weighed for gravimetric analysis. Results presented as percent contaminant removed are shown in Table 4

Compounds having similar solubility parameter and boiling point relative to CFC 113 solubility parameter of 7.2 boiling point of 47.6 C. were selected using QSPR s. Table 1summarizes these properties for some of the currently preferred compounds. The units for solubility parameter are cal cm .

The compounds were also required to have ODP s of less than 0.02to be unclassified by EPA as a Class II Ozone Depleting Substance. The toxicity of the compounds as described by a 2hr or 4hr LCvalue and cardiac sensitization was also used as a criteria for selection. A list of compounds were compiled and ranked which met these requirements. If one of these critical performance properties was not known it was calculated or predicted using QSPR s mathematical models. A total of 30compounds were identified with a solubility parameter within 1 of CFC 113 and 106compounds were identified with solubility parameter within 5 of CFC 113 and 201compounds had solubility parameters within 10 of CFC 113. Table 2shows a list of preferred compounds meeting the solubility parameter boiling point and ODP restrictions.

The material compatibility of the second generation solvent must also be comparable or better than that of the first generation solvent for example CFC 113. All of the identified second generation solvents listed above had corrosion rates with aluminum 6061and stainless steel 304which were negligible less than 0.001 mil year . Elastomer compatibility is also critical for a second generation solvent replacement. All of the second generation solvents of the present invention caused very little change in the mass thickness or diameter of PTFE. The solvents containing no chlorine or bromine had little effect on Buna N while the solvents containing chlorine and or bromine had a more severe effect on Buna N. Viton and Neoprene were significantly affected by CFC 113and 4 bromo 3 chloro 3 4 4 tribromo 1 butene however the other second generation solvents only had a minor affect on Viton and Neoprene. EPDM 60was significantly affected by all of the solvents tested with significant increases in mass diameter.

In addition to the solubility parameter several second generation solvents were experimentally evaluated for solvency with contaminants specific to oxygen handling systems. These contaminants were Krytox and Jet Lube. The solvent CH CH CF CFBr 4 bromo 3 3 4 4 tetrafluoro 1 butene had solvency performance similar to CFC 113with both contaminants. Five solvent candidates CH CH O CF CF CHF O CHCl CF CHClF CF O CHFCF CF O CHF CF and CH O CF CF had solvency performance as good or better than CFC 113with Krytox but had poor performance with Jet Lube. Conversely one solvent candidate CH CH CFCl CFBr had solvency performance similar to CFC 113 with Jet Lube but had poor performance with Krytox.

Mineral oil is used in R 22refrigeration systems. To clean these systems a flushing solvent must be capable of quickly dissolving residual mineral oil and other contaminants or decomposition products that form during compressor failure. Solvent mixtures comprising 1 50wt. A plus 50wt. B 2 75wt. A plus 25 wt. B and 3 33.3wt. A plus 33.3wt. B plus 33.3wt. C were produced where A. is 4 bromo 3 chloro 3 4 4 tribromo 1 butene B. is 1 chloro 2 2 2 trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether C. is 2 chloro 1 1 2 trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether and E. is methyl 2 2 2 trifluoroethyl 1 trifluoromethyl ether. The mineral oil was heated in a vessel with R 22using a torch to decompose it and form byproducts and residue which would be formed during a compressor burnout. This burnout oil was then applied to several metal coupons. The three solvent mixtures above were then added to separate beakers each containing one of the coupons. The coupons were subjected to 15minute immersion with 15mL of solvent mixture under static conditions at ambient temperature. Afterwards the coupons were removed and weighed for gravimetric analysis. We found that 100 98.6 and 99.3 of the compressor burnout oil was removed by solvent mixtures 1 2 and 3 respectively.

Alkylbenzene oil is also used in R 22refrigeration systems. To clean these systems a flushing solvent must be capable of quickly dissolving residual alkyl benzene oil and other contaminants or decomposition products that form during compressor failure. Solvent mixtures comprising 1 50wt. B plus 50wt. D and 2 25wt. A plus 75wt. C were produced where A. is 4 bromo 3 chloro 3 4 4 tribromo 1 butene B. is 1 chloro 2 2 2 trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether C. is 2 chloro 1 1 2 trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether and D. is 1 bromo 2 trifluoromethyl 3 3 3 trifluoropropene. The alkylbenzene oil was heated in a vessel with R 22using a torch to decompose it and form byproducts and residue which would be formed during a compressor burnout. This burnout oil was then applied to several metal coupons. The two solvent mixtures above were then added to separate beakers each containing one of the coupons. The coupons were subjected to 15minute immersion with 15mL of solvent mixture under static conditions at ambient temperature. Afterwards the coupons were removed and weighed for gravimetric analysis. We found that 99.4 and 99.2 of the compressor burnout oil was removed by solvent mixtures 1 and 2 respectively. Table 5below summarizes the cleaning performance for the mixtures of Examples 5and 6

As described in Example 5 several mixtures of solvents were prepared and tested with residual mineral oil and other contaminants or decomposition products that form during compressor failure. Solvent mixtures comprising 1wt. A 89 wt. B and 10wt. E where A. is 4 bromo 3 chloro 3 4 4 trifluoro 1 butene B. is 1 chloro 2 2 2trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether and E. is methyl 2 2 2 trifluoroethyl 1 trifluoromethyl ether. The solvent mixture was then added to beakers containing a metal coupons. The coupon was subjected to a 15minute immersion with 15mL of solvent mixture under static conditions at ambient temperature. Afterwards the coupon was removed and weighed for gravimetric analysis. We found that 88 of the compressor burnout oil contaminant was removed.

Combinations of 4solvents A. 4 bromo 3 chloro 3 4 4 trifluoro 1 butene B. 1 chloro 2 2 2trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether C. 2 chloro 1 1 2 trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether and E. methyl 2 2 2 trifluoroethyl 1 trifluoromethyl ether were tested for mineral oil burned in the presence of R 22. Solvents A B C and E were varied in composition between 0 6wt. 80 95wt. 0 10wt. and 0 5wt. respectively. The solubility of these solvent mixtures was measured when contacting the oil and residue for 1 5 and 10minutes with the burned mineral oil contaminant. A composition of 13.6wt. A and 86.4 B was found to remove 98.8 of the residue in 1minute and performed better than the other combinations for this particular residue. Results for different combinations are shown in Table 6below.

The autogenous ignition autoignition temperature was measured using ASTM method G72on several compounds selected using the method of this invention. For compounds A. 4 bromo 3 chloro 3 4 4 trifluoro 1 butene CH CH CFCl CFBr B. 1 chloro 2 2 2trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether CHF O CHCl CF C. 2 chloro 1 1 2 trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether CHClF CF O CHF D. 1 bromo 2 trifluoromethyl 3 3 3 trifluoropropene CHBr C CF and E. methyl 2 2 2 trifluoroethyl 1 trifluoromethyl ether CH O CH CF the AIT s were all categorized as B or C with compounds categorized as B being marginally category C.

The flash point temperature was measured using ASTM method D 93on several compounds and mixtures selected using the method of this invention. For compounds A. 4 bromo 3 chloro 3 4 4 trifluoro 1 butene CH CH CFCl CFBr B. 1 chloro 2 2 2trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether CHF O CHCl CF C. 2 chloro 1 1 2 trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether CHClF CF O CHF D. 1 bromo 2 trifluoromethyl 3 3 3 trifluoropropene CHBr C CF and E. methyl 2 2 2 trifluoroethyl 1 trifluoromethyl ether CH O CH CF no flash point was observed up to their respective boiling points.

Flashpoints for mixtures of 4 bromo 3 chloro 3 4 4 trifluorobutene and 1 chloro 2 2 2trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether were also measured where the concentrations of the components were 25 75 4 bromo 3 chloro 3 4 4 trifluorobutene. No flashpoints were measured.

Solvency tests with 50 by volume 4 bromo 3 chloro 3 4 4 trifluorobutene and 50 by volume ethyl nonafluorobutyl ether were performed. The solvency characteristics of these mixtures matched or exceeded that of CFC 113with Krytox and Jet Lube. The solvency of the individual components was inferior to that of CFC 113toward Krytox and Jet Lube illustrating the effectiveness of using mixtures as taught by this invention. Similarly mixtures of 4 bromo 3 3 4 4 trifluorobutene and methyl nonafluorobutyl ether produced solvency characteristic that met or exceeded those of CFC 113.

The compound ethyl perfluorobutyl ether solubility parameter of 6.69 has been measured to provide excellent solvency toward Krytox and the compound 1 chloro 2 2 2 trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether solubility parameter of 7.61 provides solvency of Mil spec 83232hydraulic fluid Mil spec 7808engine oil and Mil spec 81322aviation grease. Mixtures of these ethers with about 25 75 by volume ethyl perfluorobutyl ether will provide solvency of a broad range of contaminants improved over that of CFC 113 since CFC 113is not a good solvent for Krytox or Mil spec 81322aviation grease.

The compound methyl perfluorobutyl ether solubility parameter of 6.75 has been measured to provide excellent solvency toward Krytox and the compound 2 chloro 1 1 2 trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether solubility parameter of 7.71 provides solvency of Mil spec 83232hydraulic fluid and Mil spec 7808engine oil. Mixtures of these ethers with about 25 75 by volume methyl perfluorobutyl ether will provide solvency of a broad range of contaminants improved over that of CFC 113 since CFC 113is not a good solvent for Krytox.

The compound 4 bromo 3 chloro 3 4 4 trifluoro 1 butene solubility parameter of 7.757 has been measured to provide excellent solvency toward Mil spec 83232hydraulic fluid Mil spec 7808engine oil Mil spec 81322aviation grease and Simple Green aqueous cleaner and the compound 2 chloro 1 1 2 trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether solubility parameter of 7.71 provides solvency of Krytox in an ultrasonic bath and moderate solvency of Simple Green aqueous cleaner. Mixtures of these compounds with about 25 75 by volume 4 bromo 3 chloro 3 4 4 trifluoro 1 butene will provide solvency of a broad range of contaminants improved over that of CFC 113 since CFC 113is not a good solvent for Krytox.

The compounds methyl 2 2 2 trifluoroethyl 1 trifluoromethyl ether 1 chloro 2 2 2 trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether 2 chloro 1 1 2 trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether 25 4 bromo 3 chloro 3 4 4 trifluoro 1 butene and 75 1 chloro 2 2 2 trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether and 50 4 bromo 3 chloro 3 4 4 trifluoro 1 butene and 50 1 chloro 2 2 2 trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether were subject to ignition sensitivity to mechanical impact in liquid oxygen per ASTM G86. These compounds passed this compatibility test. The compound 4 bromo 3 chloro 3 4 4 trifluoro 1 butene alone did not pass the test. This example illustrates the unexpected benefits of using an ether such as 1 chloro 2 2 2 trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether in mixtures with compounds which may not alone be a suitable solvent for oxygen handling systems.

The compounds A 4 bromo 3 chloro 3 4 4 trifluoro 1 butene and B 1 chloro 2 2 2 trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether were mixed 50 50by volume and tested to remove Krytox. The individual components A and B remove 17.0 and 98.7 respectively of this contaminant after 15min. with ultrasonic treatment. The mixture removed 99.3 of the same contaminant under the same conditions. Hence the mixture removes more of the contaminant than either of the individual compounds.

The spirit and scope of the present invention are to be limited only by the terms of the appended claims.
