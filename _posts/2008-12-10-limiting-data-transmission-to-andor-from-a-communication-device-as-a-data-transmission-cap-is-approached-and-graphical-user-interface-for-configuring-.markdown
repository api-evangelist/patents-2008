title: Limiting data transmission to and/or from a communication device as a data transmission cap is approached and graphical user interface for configuring same
abstract: A data transmission cap represents a maximum amount of data that can be transmitted to and/or from a communication device during a subscriber billing cycle without incurring a penalty under a subscriber rate plan. To limit data transmission to and/or from the communication device as the data transmission cap is approached, a graphical user interface (GUI) is displayed. The GUI includes one or more GUI controls for selecting a data transmission limiting tactic from a plurality of distinct data transmission limiting tactics and for specifying a data transmission threshold at which the selected tactic is to take effect, the threshold being below the operative cap. Upon user interaction with the GUI control(s), user input indicating the selected data transmission tactic and specified data transmission threshold is received. The communication device or another electronic device in communication therewith is configured to effect the selected data transmission limiting tactic when the specified data transmission threshold is reached.

This disclosure relates to limiting data transmission to and or from a communication device. It also relates to a graphical user interface GUI for configuring such limiting of data transmission. It further relates to associated methods machine readable media systems and communication devices.

It is not uncommon for wireless carriers or other providers of data services to offer rate plans in which the amount payable by a subscriber during a billing cycle is tied to the total amount of data transmitted i.e. sent and or received by the subscriber s wireless device during that cycle e.g. monthly . For example a wireless carrier may charge a subscriber say 40 month for data transmission sometimes referred to colloquially as bandwidth consumption not in excess of a data transmission cap rate plan cap bandwidth cap bit cap or simply cap which may be e.g. 25 Megabytes and a surcharge of 2 megabyte for data transmission in excess of that cap. However at any given time the subscriber may be unaware of the amount of data already transmitted in relation to the rate plan cap and as a result uncertain whether data transmission will result in a surcharge. Even if the subscriber were aware of the amount of data already transmitted s he may fail to take the necessary steps to limit data transmission as the cap draws near e.g. due to inexperience with device configuration or preoccupation with daily activities. Thus the subscriber may continue to engage in activities which may involve significant data transmission such as wireless web browsing file downloads and sending or receiving email or multimedia service MMS messages and may inadvertently exceed the data transmission cap and undesirably incur a surcharge or other penalty.

In one aspect of the below described embodiment there is a method of limiting data transmission to from or to and from a communication device the method comprising displaying a graphical user interface GUI said GUI comprising one or more GUI controls for selecting a data transmission limiting tactic from a plurality of distinct data transmission limiting tactics and for specifying a data transmission threshold at which the selected data transmission limiting tactic is to take effect said data transmission threshold below an operative data transmission cap said data transmission cap representing a maximum amount of data that can be transmitted to from or to and from said communication device during a subscriber billing cycle without incurring a penalty under a subscriber rate plan by way of said one or more GUI controls receiving user input indicating the selected data transmission tactic and the specified data transmission threshold and based on said user input configuring said communication device or another electronic device in communication therewith to effect the selected data transmission limiting tactic when the specified data transmission threshold is reached.

Collaboration server is a conventional server having memory in communication with at least one processor . The exemplary processor executes collaboration software such as Microsoft Exchange Server Lotus Domino Server or the like. The software maintains accounts for multiple users. Each account has various associated capabilities intended to support collaboration between users such as electronic messaging e.g. email and instant messaging calendaring and address book capabilities for example. Email capabilities typically includes maintaining an inbox for each user that is capable of receiving email messages optionally having attachments. The attachments may for example be electronic business card attachments Microsoft Word documents Microsoft Excel spreadsheets Microsoft PowerPoint presentations Adobe Portable Document Format PDF documents HyperText Markup Language HTML files various image file formats e.g. .wmf .emf .gif .jpeg .bmp .png .wav files Zip archive and American Standard Code for Information Interchange ASCII files. The email messages and attachments may be received at collaboration server in the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions MIME format for example. Some email messages may be formatted using a HyperText Markup Language HTML as is conventional. Instant messaging capability may include the ability to define a buddy list or friend list receive presence updates regarding users in that list and send and receive instant messages possibly with multimedia content such as images video and documents to selected users. Calendaring capabilities may include the capacity to schedule appointments invite other users to attend scheduled appointments and check other users public scheduled appointments for example. Address book capabilities may include maintaining contact information e.g. name address telephone numbers etc. for numerous contacts. Machine readable instructions e.g. an executable image comprising the collaboration software may be loaded from a machine readable medium into memory prior to execution by processor .

Intermediary server may be a server product sold by Research in Motion Limited. The intermediary server executes two software applications which intercommunicate during operation the mobile wireless data server software and the attachment service .

The mobile wireless data server software is a software application that is responsible for pushing certain data associated with a user account at collaboration server e.g. received email messages to the wireless communication device . The software communicates with collaboration server for purposes of monitoring specified user accounts for activity and for pushing data representative of that activity to the device . For example when a new email message is received the email message may be automatically converted to a proprietary format known as Compressed Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions CMIME and transmitted to the wireless communication device as a stream of bytes via data network possibly through a firewall not expressly illustrated in . A similar mechanism is used for instant messages and for syncing a new address book entry from the server with the wireless device. Instant messaging may use the a proprietary protocol e.g. BlackBerry Instant Messaging or BBIM to communicate with the intermediary server that in turn communicates with an IM collaboration server. Address book uses a proprietary SYNC protocol to communicate with the intermediary server that in turn talks to the collaboration server. In addition the software receives email attachment requests from device and intercommunicates with attachment service for the purpose of obtaining the desired attachments for transmission to the device on an on demand basis.

In pushing email messages to wireless communication device software may be responsible for automatically breaking email messages exceeding a predetermined threshold size into chunks . The first chunk is pushed to the device automatically while subsequent chunks are transmitted to the device individually on an on demand basis. The rationale for this functionality is to seek user confirmation that a large message is truly desired at the device before it is transmitted there in full to avoid unnecessarily transmitting large amounts of data and possibly risking a surcharge or other penalty for excessive wireless data transmission under a subscriber rate plan as described below . The on demand request for a next chunk of an email message may be generated at device and sent to server e.g. when a user of device selects a more menu item within an email message application to indicate a desire to display a next portion of the message. As will be appreciated the behavior of this mechanism may be capable of being dynamically changed in the present embodiment as a data transmission cap is approached with a view to limiting data transmission to from the device .

The attachment service is a software application that processes email attachments in preparation for their possible transmission to and viewing at a wireless communication device such as device . The attachment service intercommunicates with the mobile wireless data server software for the purpose of handling requests for email attachments or portions thereof from wireless communication devices such as device and for coordinating delivery of requested attachments or attachment portions to the wireless communication device via data network and wireless network . Generally when an email message having an attachment is received at a user s inbox at collaboration server the email message or a first chunk thereof is pushed to the wireless communication device along with an indication of the existence of the attachment. The user of device will be made aware of the fact that the received message includes an attachment. However transmission of the attachment to the device may be deferred until the user of device has specifically indicated a desire to view it. This is again to avoid inadvertent transmission of a large amount of data which the attachment may represent under a subscriber rate plan in which a surcharge may be owed or other penalty incurred for data transmission in excess of a predetermined cap. Large attachments may be broken into chunks to be transmitted to device individually on demand in a similar fashion to the breaking up of large email messages into chunks described above. This is possibly in accordance with U.S. patent application Publication No. 2005 0108636 which is hereby incorporated by reference hereinto.

As will be described either or both of mobile wireless data server software and attachment service may be modified from its conventional form to support the limiting of data transmission to and or from wireless communication device as a data transmission cap is approached. Machine readable instructions e.g. an executable image comprising the mobile wireless data server software and attachment service software may be loaded from a machine readable medium into memory prior to execution by processor .

The intermediate server may also store in memory collections of data representing a back up of user specified data form the wireless communication device on a per user basis

Data network is a conventional data network which is used to transmit data which in this embodiment includes electronic messages such as email message and any attachments or instant messages and possibly synchronization s of data e.g. address book contacts between the collaboration software on server and the relevant application e.g. address book at the wireless communication device . The network may deliver the data to a network operation centre not illustrated for purposes of relaying to the wireless network . The data network also transmits on demand requests for email chunks or email attachment chunks in the opposite direction to the intermediary server . Data network may be the public Internet or a privately managed and operated Internet Protocol IP network for example.

Wireless network is a conventional wireless network which serves as the final link in the communication chain between the intermediary server and the wireless communication device . Network may for example be a mobile data communication network such as a Mobitex DataTAC or General Packet Radio Service GPRS mobile data communication network or a conventional voice communication network such as Advanced Mobile Phone Service AMPS Time Division Multiple Access TDMA Code Division Multiple Access CDMA Personal Communications Service PCS or Global System for Mobile Communications GSM for example. Other types of data and voice networks separate and integrated could alternatively be utilized for network .

Wireless communication device is a two way radio frequency RF communication device having data communication capabilities such as a handheld device sold by Research In Motion Ltd. The use of device for receiving and or transmitting data is governed by a subscriber rate plan between the user of device a subscriber and a wireless service provider. The plan defines an operative data transmission cap representing a maximum amount of data that can be transmitted to from or to and from the device during a subscriber billing cycle e.g. monthly without incurring a surcharge or other penalty. The device has been modified from a conventional configuration in order to support configuration of components of system for limiting data transmission to and or from the device as the data transmission cap is approached as described below. Wireless communication device is illustrated in greater detail in .

Referring to wireless communication device includes a pointing device keyboard a display a processor memory and a communications subsystem . These components are communicatively coupled as illustrated in .

Pointing device is a user input device which permits the user to move a cursor about display for the purpose of highlighting and or selecting GUI controls such as buttons or menu items. The device may for example be a trackwheel trackball or touchscreen.

Keyboard is a user input device which permits a user of the wireless communication device to enter text for such purposes as composing and sending email for example.

Display is an output device that is capable of presenting a graphical user interface to a user. The display may be a full graphic Liquid Crystal Display LCD for example. The dimensions of display may be limited due to the limited overall size of the device .

Processor is a conventional processor which controls the overall operation of the wireless communication device based on user manipulation of pointing device user actuation of keys on the keyboard and the receipt of data from wireless network . The microprocessor executes operating system software and application software that is stored in local memory . Microprocessor is communicatively coupled either directly or indirectly to the keyboard display memory and communication subsystem as illustrated in .

Memory stores operating system and other software used at the device including operating system software email application browser application and address book application . Memory may consist of flash memory random access memory RAM read only memory ROM or a combination of these for example. Typically at least some of memory will be persistent. It will be appreciated that memory is a form of machine readable medium.

Operating system o s software is software which governs the basic operation of wireless communication device . In the present embodiment the o s software has been modified to provide a GUI that permits the user of device to configure various components of system for limiting data transmission as the subscriber s data transmission cap for device is approached as will be described. In general the GUI may be part of the same software component that includes the SyncManager API described below which is not necessarily part of the operating system. Additionally the o s software of the present embodiment includes a SyncManager Application Programming Interface API . This API provides a mechanism for a software application executing at device to cause an application specified collection of data to be periodically backed up at i.e. synchronized with collaboration server e.g. for possible later restoration to the device . A known version of this API is presently described at blackberry.net developers docs 4.1api net rim device api synchronization SyncManager.html which description is hereby incorporated by reference hereinto. The API permits the user to specify whether a particular collection shall be synchronized over the air OTA i.e. via a wireless transmission medium referred to as the primary transmission medium or serially i.e. via a wired transmission medium referred to as the secondary transmission medium . For example by invoking SyncManager.allowOTASync with a first parameter indicating the collection to be synced i.e. backed up and a second parameter set to true or false the identified collection may be synchronized using the primary or secondary media respectively.

Email application is a software application that is capable of managing and displaying email messages and email message attachments at device . The email application incorporates an attachment viewer component which facilitates the viewing of recognized attachments.

Browser application or simply browser is a software application that is capable of displaying markup language documents e.g. HTML or Wireless Markup Language documents having embedded images. The browser is dynamically user configurable to either display or not display such embedded images at the election of the user.

Address book application is a software application that allows the user of device to view and maintain contact information name address telephone numbers etc. for numerous contacts. The contacts are the same contacts as are maintained by the collaboration software at server . These contacts are periodically synchronized between device and server . Synchronization may be performed either via the primary wireless transmission medium or the secondary wired transmission medium at the election of the user in a similar fashion to the backing up of data collections described above.

The above software applications may be accompanied by various other software applications such as an instant messaging application for example resident in memory not expressly illustrated . Machine readable instructions e.g. an executable image comprising the o s software and the various software applications in memory may be loaded from a machine readable medium prior to execution at wireless communication device . This may occur at the factory in which device is assembled. Alternatively such instructions may be downloaded to the device via wireless network by way of an over the air download. Similarly any software aspects of data transmission tallier described below may be loaded or downloaded in like fashion.

Communication subsystem is responsible for effecting data communications and possibly voice communications between the device and rest of system via wireless network . Subsystem may include such components as a receiver a transmitter one or more antennas and a digital signal processor none of which are expressly illustrated. The subsystem also includes a data transmission tallier module . The tallier module is a software firmware or hardware component or a component that is a combination of two or more of those types of components that is responsible for tallying how much data has been transmitted to and or from the wireless communication device during a current billing cycle. The tallier module may operate at a transport protocol level tracking the number and size of packets being transmitted to and or from the device for example. The tallier module may interact with o s software e.g. for the purpose of being instructed to reset a tally e.g. at the beginning of a billing cycle or to report a current tally. The o s may be configurable either by the user or through automated processing of an electronic communication from the wireless service provider for the purpose of setting the billing cycle start date and duration. This is so that the dates at which the tallier module should be instructed to reset to zero may be automatically computed.

The wireless communication device also includes a speaker and may further include various other device subsystems .

Operation for limiting data transmission to and or from the wireless communication device as a data transmission cap is approached shall now be described. It is initially assumed that a user of device concerned over the possibility of incurring a surcharge or other penalty for excessive data transmission to and or from the device under a subscriber rate plan wishes to configure the system to automatically limit data transfer as the cap is approached. Accordingly the user interacts with the device e.g. using pointing device so as to invoke a GUI on display for performing such configuration. GUI illustrated in .

Referring to an initial dialog box of GUI is identifiable by the label RULES FOR LIMITING DATA TRANSMISSION within its title bar. Dialog box contains various GUI controls namely a spinner a list box and four buttons and .

Spinner is used to set the data transmission cap that is defined by the subscriber s rate plan. The spinner may default to zero or to a value that is communicated by the wireless service provider e.g. via an email message from the provider indicative of the operative cap. Such an email message may be automatically processed at the device in order to populate spinner . In the present example the spinner shows that the currently operative cap is 25 megabytes. In some embodiments this amount is user configurable e.g. may be set increased or decreased by the user .

List box shows the currently defined rules for limiting data transmission to and or from device . A single entry in represents the single rule that is presently defined. That rule employs a data limiting tactic whereby any email message in an HTML format shall be converted to ASCII before being sent to or from the device in order to reduce the size of its body. The parenthesized value 50 in entry represents the percentage of the operative data transmission cap that must be reached before the rule takes effect. Thus in the present example the rule becomes operative when 12.5 MB of data i.e. 50 of the operative cap of 25 MB has been transmitted during the current billing cycle.

Buttons and are for adding a new rule to list box deleting a selected rule from list box accepting the rules as defined or exiting the dialog box without accepting any changes to the rules respectively. Selection of button results in the invocation of a further dialog box of GUI which is shown in .

Referring to dialog box allows the user to define a new rule to be added to those already shown in list box of . Dialog box contains various GUI controls namely a combo box for selecting a data limiting tactic from a plurality of tactics a spinner for specifying a data transmission threshold at which the selected tactic is to take effect a combo box for configuring a user notification to be provided when the tactic takes effect and OK and Cancel buttons and for accepting the new rule or exiting from dialog box respectively. The combo boxes and and spinner are shown to contain default values in .

User interaction with combo box results in the presentation of a drop down menu as shown in . The six menu items in the drop down menu represent six distinct data transmission limiting tactics of the present embodiment from any which one may be selected.

Referring to first menu item represents a data limiting tactic whereby a size of chunks into which an electronic message e.g. email message exceeding a threshold size is subdivided for individual on demand transmission to the wireless communication device from intermediary sever is reduced. This tactic may be implemented in the present embodiment at mobile wireless data server software of server .

A second menu item represents a data limiting tactic whereby a size of a body of an electronic message is reduced prior to its transmission to or from said wireless communication device . Specifically the tactic causes any email message in an HTML format to be converted to ASCII before being sent to or from the device as noted above. For messages that are incoming to the device this tactic may be implemented at mobile wireless data server software of server in the present embodiment. For messages that are outgoing from the device this tactic may be implemented within email application in the present embodiment.

A third menu item represents a data limiting tactic whereby a size of an attachment of an electronic message is reduced prior to its transmission to the wireless communication device . The reduction in size of the attachment may for example by achieved through such techniques as data compression reduction in image resolution or other approaches. For example it may be possible for certain attachment types to be broken down into a number of pieces the first of which could be sent to the device with the option provided to the user to fetch the rest if desired e.g. an attached email thread or plain text file attachment . In the present example this tactic applies to attachments to messages that are incoming to the device and may thus be implemented within attachment service at server .

A fourth menu item represents a data limiting tactic whereby only a header portion of an electronic message is transmitted to or from the wireless communication device . For messages that are incoming to the device this tactic may be implemented at mobile wireless data server software of server . For messages that are outgoing from the device this tactic may be implemented within email application .

A fifth menu item represents a data limiting tactic whereby the transmission of data to or from the device is changed from occurring over a primary transmission medium to which the data transmission cap is applicable to a secondary transmission medium to which the data transmission cap is not applicable . In particular the rule specifies that address book synchronization between application of and collaboration software of shall occur via cable rather than over the air. It is assumed that menu item has been selected by the user.

A sixth menu item represents a data limiting tactic whereby browser at device is configured to refrain from requesting images within browsed documents.

It will be appreciated that the six menu items illustrated in are illustrative only and that the number of menu items may be larger or smaller than six in alternative embodiments. Moreover the data limiting tactics employed in alternative embodiments may differ wholly or partly from those represented in menu . For example an alternative embodiment may use the aforementioned sync API of the o s to dynamically change the backing up of a data collection from the primary wireless transmission medium to the secondary wired transmission medium.

Next and with reference to the user through interaction with spinner specifies a data transmission threshold at which the data transmission limiting tactic represented by the menu item is to take effect. In the illustrated example a value of 90 is specified meaning that the selected tactic is to take effect when the data transmission tally is at 90 of the operative cap. In general the GUI control s by which the data transmission threshold is specified should permit specification of the threshold below the operative data transmission cap in order to support activation of the tactic s as the cap is approached. In some embodiments the threshold may be specified as a relative amount such as a percentage less than 100 or a fraction less than one. This may be advantageous in that the user can specify the threshold even without knowing the value of the operative cap. Another possible advantage of expressing a threshold as a relative amount is that the threshold may not need to be updated if the cap increases or decreases because the relative proportion of the threshold to the cap will remain unchanged. Alternatively the threshold may be expressed as an absolute amount e.g. 12.5 MB . In such cases it may be desirable to also display the operative cap as an absolute amount e.g. 25 MB in the GUI so that the user may compare the two if desired. In some embodiments the GUI control s may actively preclude specification of a data transmission threshold at or above the operative data transmission cap. This is to force specification of thresholds below the cap. For example the maximum value that can be specified by spinner of may be 99 which would be lower than the percentage 100 that represents the cap amount.

Subsequent user interaction with combo box results in the presentation of a drop down menu . The three menu items in the drop down menu represent three different user notifications that may be provided when the selected data transmission tactic is effected. Specifically the first menu item is for configuring the device to provide no user notification when the tactic takes effect. The second menu item specifies that user notification is to take the form of an email message which may not be an email message by strict definition but rather may be a new entry in a message list that actually originates at the device but is made to appear as a received email message or other type of message with the rationale being that because the user is familiar with checking for new messages in the message list the message is likely to be seen. The third menu item which is shown as having been selected in specifies that user notification is to take the form of a popup message e.g. displayed on the display of wireless communication device . The number and types of user notifications may vary in alternative embodiments.

When the user has completed interaction with the GUI controls and of selection of OK button causes dialog box to close. When dialog box is redisplayed a new entry representing the newly defined rule appears within list box as shown in .

Referring to selection of the OK button causes the currently defined rules to be accepted. When this occurs appropriate steps are taken to configure device and or one or more communication devices in communication with device e.g. server or as necessary for the selected data transmission limiting tactics to automatically take effect when the respective data transmission thresholds are reached. The determination of whether configuration is to occur locally i.e. at the same communication device at which the GUI is displayed or remotely i.e. at a communication device in communication with device such as server will usually depend at least in part upon the tactics that have been selected. For example in the present embodiment the first data limitation rule represented by entry of entails configuration of both of the server and device as noted above while the second rule represented by entry of entails only configuration of the address book application at device . Should remote configuration be required this may be achieved through transmission of at least one appropriate command to the device s to be configured for causing the necessary configuration to occur. The commands by be specific to the tactic being used and may serve to set flags or configuration options at the target device s as might otherwise be user configurable. At the device s to be configured the steps involved in achieving the desired configuration may include writing to a electronic configuration file setting a flag invoking a routine of a relevant piece of software or the like.

Once the necessary configuration has been performed the subscriber may use wireless communication device to engage in various activities which may involve data transmission such as wireless web browsing file downloads and sending or receiving email messages with large attachments. The o s will automatically instruct the data transmission tallier module to reset at the beginning of each billing cycle. The module will keep a running tally of the amount of data transmitted during the current billing cycle. When one of the specified data transmission thresholds is reached the selected data transmission limiting tactic will automatically be effected.

For example in the present embodiment when 50 of the data transmission cap is reached the first data transmission limiting tactic i.e. email conversion from HTML to ASCII represented by entry of is effected. To the extent that user notification of this occurrence was elected using GUI control the user notification is provided in order to apprise the user of the activation of the relevant data limiting tactic. As noted above for messages that are incoming to the device this tactic may be implemented at mobile wireless data server software of intermediary server . To apprise intermediary server that the tactic is to be activated the device may send a command to the intermediary server to cause email messages to be converted from HTML to ASCII before being transmitted to the device . This may involve setting an appropriate flag or configuration option at server . Indeed server may be unaware of the data transmission limiting tactic as such or of the operative thresholds. Rather it may simply act as a slave to the device implementing commands from device on demand. The device may thus serve as the master of the operative data transmission limiting scheme commanding other devices as necessary for the currently operative tactics. A similar mechanism may be employed when one or more tactics is are to be deactivated e.g. at the beginning of a next billing cycle .

Later when 90 of the data transmission cap is reached the second data transmission limiting tactic i.e. address book syncing via cable rather than over the air represented by entry of is effected. Again to the extent that user notification for apprising the user of the activation of the data limiting tactic has been preconfigured to occur the desired user notification takes place. Activation of this tactic may occur solely at the device. That is because there is no intermediary server component to this tactic the device may activate simply by configuring itself to sync its address book collection with the intermediary server serially i.e. by way of a cable rather than over the air OTA . This may be accomplished by appropriately invoking the SyncManager API as described above.

It will be appreciated that when the second data limiting tactic is effected at 90 of the cap this is in addition to the first data limiting tactic which has already been in effect since the data transmission tally reached 50 of the cap. This illustrates the fact that definition of tiers of data limiting tactics is possible. That is the user may configure the system so that the closer the data transmission tally is to the cap the more data limiting tactics will take effect. This may have the effect of progressively reducing data transmission by ever increasing amounts as the cap is approached with a view to reducing the likelihood that the cap will be exceeded. This occurs even absent user awareness of the current data transmission tally. In some embodiments the user may be kept aware of the current tally as well as any currently active data limiting tactics e.g. through the use of suitable icons or text in a GUI displayed during run time. The tally may be represented as a percentage for example while the currently active data limiting tactics may be represented as icons.

As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art various modifications can be made to the above described embodiments. For example some embodiments may not display the operative data transmission cap as shown in at . The operative cap may be undisplayed or may be displayed in such a manner that it is not user configurable. When the cap is undisplayed it may be preferable for the data transmission threshold to be expressed as a relative amount e.g. a percentage or fraction so that the user may appreciate the relative proportion of the threshold to the cap even though the cap amount may be unknown.

It will be appreciated that the above described approach for limiting data transmission may be used for various types of communication devices regardless of the transmission medium or media over which they are capable of communicating wireless wired fiber optic etc. . This approach is not limited to wireless communication devices nor is it necessarily only for use in push email systems. Moreover the GUI that is used to configure the data limiting tactics and thresholds at which they are to take effect need not necessarily be displayed at the communication device to and or from which data transmission is to be limited. For example GUI could have been displayed at intermediary server even if all of the configuration necessary to effect the selected data transmission limiting tactics are to be implemented exclusively at wireless communication device . Such configuration of device may be remotely commanded from server .

It should further be appreciated that the type of GUI control s used for selecting data transmission limiting tactics and associated data transmission thresholds need not be exactly as shown in . Other types of GUI controls could be used. For example one GUI control may comprise an editable table view having three columns labelled tactic threshold and notification . Each row in the table may represent a different data limiting tactic. Tactics may be defined by adding new rows to the table or amended by editing the cells within a row.

Other modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art and therefore the invention is defined in the claims.
