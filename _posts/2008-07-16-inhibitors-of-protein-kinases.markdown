This invention pertains to compounds that inhibit protein kinases such as Aurora kinases compositions containing the compounds and methods of treating diseases using the compounds.

Mitosis is a process by which a complete copy of a duplicated genome is segregated by the microtuble spindle apparatus into two daughter cells. Aurora kinases key mitotic regulators required for genome stability have been found to be overexpressed in human tumors. There is therefore an existing need in the therapeutic arts for compounds which inhibit Aurora kinases compositions comprising the inhibitors and methods of treating diseases during which Aurora kinases are unregulated or overexpressed.

One embodiment of this invention therefore pertains to compounds that inhibit Aurora kinases the compounds having Formula I

To determine activity of representative compounds of the invention Active Aurora B enzyme recombinant residues 1 344 and INCENP recombinant GST fusion protein from Upstate were incubated in wells of a 384 well plate with biotinylted histone H3 peptide residues 1 21 Upstate 1 mM ATP and various concentrations of inhibitors in a Hepes buffer pH 7.4 containing MgCl sodium othrovanadate and Triton X 100. After 1 hour the reaction was stopped with EDTA and anti phospho histone H3 Europium Cryptate Cis Bio and SA APC Phycolink Prozyme were added to detect the phosphopeptide. The amount of phosphorylation was determined by the time resolved fluorescence ratio of signals at 665 nm and 615 nm.
