title: User defined scenarios in a three dimensional geo-spatial system
abstract: A method, apparatus, and article of manufacture provide the ability to store user defined scenarios in a three-dimensional system. A 3D view of a real world scene is displayed, using a three-dimensional (3D) graphics application. Plug-ins are installed into the 3D graphics application. A user selects a subset of the plug-ins, defines settings for the subset of plug-ins, and defines a visualization trait for each plug-in in the subset. The user associates an identification of the selected subset, the settings, and the visualization trait with a scenario bookmark that is saved. The bookmark can be selected by a user to display a visualization of a scenario based on the selected subset, settings, and visualization trait.

This application is related to the following co pending and commonly assigned patent application which application is incorporated by reference herein 

U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 245 568 entitled SUN SHADOW SIMULATION IN A GEOSPATIAL SYSTEM by Richard D. Howard filed on Oct. 3 2008 and

U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 286 911 entitled VIEWPORT OVERLAYS TO EXPOSE ALTERNATE DATA REPRESENTATIONS by Richard D. Howard filed on Oct. 3 2008.

The present invention relates generally to three dimensional 3D applications and in particular to a method apparatus and article of manufacture for a framework for aggregating design models and geographic information system GIS data within an immersive 3D geospatial environment i.e. a digital city . Further the invention provides the ability for a user to define a scenario in a 3D geo spatial system.

Geographic information systems GIS are commonly used and generally refer to an information system that integrates hardware software and data in order to capture store analyze manage and display present data that is spatially referenced i.e. linked to location or is geographically referenced . GIS systems commonly provide a two dimensional 2D visualization of data in the form of maps globes reports and charts. However prior art GIS systems fail to provide the capability to merge GIS data with additional information in order to visualize analyze and simulate trends phenomena states and events. Further three dimensional 3D systems also fail to provide such capabilities.

In addition prior art systems fail to provide the ability for a user to easily establish a defined scenario using a set of plug ins and settings for such plug ins. Accordingly the user has no mechanism to easily compare contrast and or simulate a desired scenario and is respective visualization in a three dimensional four dimensional manner.

To overcome the problems of the prior art embodiments of the invention allow users to define what if scenarios using a type of visual bookmarking. Each scenario captures specific model and linked data overrides supplied by the user a set of plug ins and their settings and visualization parameters and traits.

In the following description reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof and which is shown by way of illustration several embodiments of the present invention. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.

One or more embodiments of the invention provide an application and development framework for aggregating design models and GIS data within an immersive 3D geospatial environment for the purposes of visualizing analyzing and simulating trends phenomena state and events in ways that are not possible within conventional 2D GIS or existing 3D application software. In other words embodiments of the invention provide the ability to view analyze simulate trends phenomena states and events in a digital city.

3D Geospatial Environment containing both simplified and fully textured rendition based on high resolution lidar and ortho photography for content such as Digital Terrain Models Streets and Roadways Water Features Railways Buildings Utility Infrastructure and Street Furniture 

Importation storage and data mapping of full 3D design models from various software e.g. software available from the assignee of the present invention including AutoCAD Map3D Revit Architecture Civil3D and Inventor as well as support for GIS formats via Autodesk Feature Data Objects FDO technology 

Real time 3D rendering and animation including transparency reflections lights shadows and atmospheric effects 

One or more embodiments of the invention are implemented by a computer implemented graphics program wherein the graphics program is represented by a window displayed on the display device . Generally the graphics program comprises logic and or data embodied in or readable from a device media carrier or signal e.g. one or more fixed and or removable data storage devices connected directly or indirectly to the computer one or more remote devices coupled to the computer via a data communications device etc.

In one or more embodiments instructions implementing the graphics program are tangibly embodied in a computer readable medium e.g. data storage device which could include one or more fixed or removable data storage devices such as a zip drive floppy disc drive hard drive CD ROM drive DVD drive tape drive etc. Further the graphics program is comprised of instructions which when read and executed by the computer causes the computer to perform the steps necessary to implement and or use the present invention. Graphics program and or operating instructions may also be tangibly embodied in a memory and or data communications devices of computer thereby making a computer program product or article of manufacture according to the invention. As such the terms article of manufacture and computer program product as used herein are intended to encompass a computer program accessible from any computer readable device or media.

A network such as the Internet connects clients to server computers . Additionally network may utilize radio frequency RF to connect and provide the communication between clients and servers . Clients may execute a client application or Web browser e.g. as described above and communicate with server computers executing Web servers . The software executing on clients may be downloaded from server computer to client computers and installed as a plug in or ActiveX control of a Web browser. Accordingly clients may utilize ActiveX components component object model COM or distributed COM DCOM components to provide a user interface on a display of client .

Web server may host an Active Server Page ASP or Internet Server Application Programming Interface ISAPI application which may be executing scripts. The scripts invoke objects that execute business logic referred to as business objects . The business objects then manipulate data in database through a database management system DBMS . Alternatively database may be part of or connected directly to client instead of communicating obtaining the information from database across network . When a developer encapsulates the business functionality into objects the system may be referred to as a component object model COM system. Accordingly the scripts executing on web server and or application invoke COM objects that implement the business logic. Further server may utilize Microsoft s Transaction Server MTS to access required data stored in database via an interface such as ADO Active Data Objects OLE DB Object Linking and Embedding DataBase or ODBC Open DataBase Connectivity .

Those skilled in the art will recognize many modifications may be made to this exemplary environment without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example those skilled in the art will recognize that any combination of the above components or any number of different components including different logic data different peripherals and different devices may be used to implement the present invention so long as similar functions are performed thereby.

The Graphical User Interface displays information to the operator and provides the functionality for the operator s interaction with the graphics program .

The Image Engine processes the DWG files and delivers the resulting graphics to the monitor for display. In one or more embodiments the Image Engine provides a complete application programming interface API that allows other computer programs to interface to the graphics program as needed.

The Database is comprised of two separate types of databases 1 a 3D database known as the 3D world space that stores 3D information and 2 one or more 2D databases known as the 2D view ports that stores 2D information derived from the 3D information.

As used herein the graphics program may consist of a variety of different type of applications including GIS CAD computer aided design solid modeling systems animation products rendering systems etc. Embodiments of the invention are not limited to those software applications explicitly described herein but by the limitations set forth in the claims.

Embodiments of the invention provide an architecture and method of using plug in modules for user defined 3D 4D visualization analysis and simulation. Users clients are provided with the ability to search for download and immediately use plug ins from an online catalog offered by one or more servers . These plug ins can be supplied by software developers and enable users to visualize analyze and simulate trends phenomena state and events via software application .

Such a plug in environment allows many different types of applications to load specific data types and allows interaction between those data types. Most traditional plug in environments do not allow this. Plug ins for different data types may include textures 3D models 2D models particle systems and geo based behavior systems behaviors based on specific geo information .

Another advantage of the plug in architecture is that it allows user to load models seamlessly without having to go through the lengthy steps of importing files. Accordingly a full 3D environment and real time rendering capability of embodiments of the invention combined with the analytic capabilities supplied by a plug in developer allows user to visualize their data in ways not formerly possible.

Plug ins are loaded and associated with specific models and scenarios within the digital city of embodiments of the invention. A user can override model and linked data values enter plug in parameters and control the visualization of results. Plug ins have the ability to automatically add themselves or make calculations based on the data of a particular file making up a digital city environment.

For example based on GIS fault data an earthquake preparedness drill particle system could be suggested and or instantiated. Another example would be a recommended parking configuration based on the number of roads or total lanes adjacent to a particular structure. Alternatively a road configuration could be suggested based on the parking structures and parking places in a given city block.

The location plug in contains the display and overrides to the geospatial location and position information for the building. In this regard if location panel were expanded the user would have the option of specifying where Building A is located. For example the user can specify the latitude longitude and elevation. Alternatively the user can enter an address e.g. number street city state and or zip etc. . Further entering information in one field of the location panel may automatically retrieve and output information in another field e.g. entry of an address may automatically fill in the corresponding latitude longitude and elevation. In addition once the location information is entered the object e.g. Building A would automatically move to the location specified. The resulting visualization from the location plug in provides a visual representation of Building A in a 3D environment.

The occupancy plug in allows the user to establish the current number of occupants A to be displayed and overrides B i.e. the maximum number of occupants to the number of occupants for Building A . The visualization of the occupancy plug in would provide for multiple dots indicative of persons in Building A or distributed throughout building A .

The utilities plug in contains the display and overrides to the utility usage i.e. water and power for Building A . The visualization of the utilities plug in results in line or effect simulating power and water usage in Building A .

The greenhouse emissions plug in contains the display and overrides to the LEED Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design green building rating system emissions impact score for the Building A . The values on greenhouse emissions panel are automatically i.e. without additional user input updated based on the occupancy panel and utility consumption panel for a selected building. Alternatively the user may have the options of setting the greenhouse emissions values in panel and the system can automatically adjust either the occupancy values or utility values that are necessary to reach the greenhouse emissions values set forth in panel . In this regard the user can determine which values panels and are locked and which can be adjusted depending on the values specified in the other panels. The visualization of greenhouse emissions plug in would result in a halo type effect displayed around and emanating from Building A .

Accordingly developers and plug in authors can harness to the full power of 3D rendering to convey the results of their calculations. In this regard the 3D simulation illustrated in may change its coloring or areas displayed based on the visualizations resulting from plug ins . Check boxes C C may be utilized to determine whether a resulting visualization for the respective plug in is displayed in the 3D rendering of . For example the user may check boxes e.g. check boxes C C C and C within panel to determine which plug ins will be reflected in the display of building A of . This allows users to visualize and analyze their data in new and powerful ways.

One or more embodiments of the invention use plug ins to create animations that simulate results over time 4D . In addition plug ins can be used to simulate human behavior in the 3D environment. Given some human interaction and a stimulus in that environment the plug in architecture allows a user to predict and visualize certain human behaviors. The architecture also allows the user to visualize different temporal simulations like the sun and moon weather patterns and phenomena such as tornadoes and snowfall see detailed examples below .

One or more embodiments of the invention all the user to define scenarios that incorporate specific model and linked data overrides plug ins and their settings and visualization traits. In other words a group of settings are stored into a type of visual bookmark that allows the user to define specific what if scenarios. Each scenario or bookmark captures specific model and linked data overrides supplied by the user a set of plug ins and their settings and visualization parameters and traits.

By bookmarking scenarios and sub scenarios with different settings the user can quickly compare and analyze their information and make informed decisions. This essentially allows a user to save certain data sets apply them to scenes recall them and compare and contrast. In the prior art to visualize and compare different scenarios the users were required to modify a file save it with a certain criteria render it and repeat the process for each different scenario and comparing the final renderings. The ability to store the various settings into a bookmark is faster and interactive so the user is not required to save files using different settings.

Alternatively the user can select the scenario bookmark in panel which allows the user to select a set of predefined settings. Once the desired properties for a bookmark have been established i.e. in dialog box panel the user can opt to create a bookmark to associate all of the settings with a bookmark placeholder or thumbnail for those settings using dialog box . Once created and if in the appropriate mode the user may be presented with a group of selectable icons or menu options representative of the various bookmarks that have been established. For example icons and are representative of various bookmarked scenarios that have been established by a user. Thus each scenario represented by bookmarked icons provides a selection of one or more plug ins and properties settings that permit the user to define a particular visualization in a 3D 4D environment.

In view of the above bookmarked scenarios can be viewed as a way of storing both a set of data a specific set of models that have been loaded into a server into a name a set with a series of plug ins and potentially some overriding information for those plug ins.

At step a three dimensional 3D view of a real world scene is displayed on a display device using a 3D graphics application.

At step one or more plug ins are installed into the 3D graphics application. The plug ins may be viewed as an application that enables a user to visualize analyze and simulate a particular user defined scenario in the 3D view.

At step input is received from a user defining one or more settings for the subset of plug ins. As described above such settings may include particular calculations or values that are specified.

At step input is received from the user defining a visualization trait for each plug in in the subset of plug ins. In other words the user specifies whether the visualization for the plug in should be displayed in the 3D view. Steps and may further include receiving additional input from the user defining a linked data override. Such a linked data override may consist of a link to an external file that contains values for the one or more settings.

At step input is received from the user associating an identification of the selected subset of plug ins the one or more settings and the visualization trait with a scenario bookmark. If a linked data override is specified as part of steps and such a linked data override is also including the association of the information with the scenario bookmark at step .

At step input is received from the user saving the scenario bookmark such that a user can select the saved scenario bookmark and display a visualization of a scenario based on the selected set of plug ins one or more settings and the visualization trait for each plug in in the subset. Such saving of the scenario bookmark may be to persistent storage e.g. a hard drive compact disk digital video disk DVD etc. . Accordingly based on the stored saved scenario bookmark the user has the option of later selecting the bookmark and displaying a visualization based on all of the information and settings contained in the bookmark. Such a visualization represents a particular scenario defined by the user based on the information in the bookmark.

Step may further include the displaying of multiple scenario bookmarks on a display device that the user can dynamically select from. Such a scenario bookmark s may be displayed in the form of a thumbnail icon. Thus multiple thumbnails may be displayed e.g. as illustrated in and the user can elect to quickly dynamically and easily view a particular scenario that the user or another user has defined. Such a capability allows the user to easily compare and contrast different scenarios as desired.

This concludes the description of the preferred embodiment of the invention. The following describes some alternative embodiments for accomplishing the present invention. For example any type of computer such as a mainframe minicomputer or personal computer or computer configuration such as a timesharing mainframe local area network or standalone personal computer could be used with the present invention.
