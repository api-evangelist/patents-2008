The invention described herein was made in the performance of work under NASA Contract No. SAA AT 07 003 as is subject to the provisions of Section 305 of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 as amended 42 U.S.C. 2457 .

The present invention relates generally to a torsion spring and more specifically to a torsion spring for use with a robotic arm.

Robots in particular robotic arms are often used in manufacturing and assembly plants to perform repetitive functions. The robotic arms often include joints to connect one portion of the robotic arm to another to facilitate the dexterity of the robotic arms and allow for relative movement between the two portions. This commonly includes the use of a rotational joint to move one portion of an arm with respect to another. Springs incorporated into the joint can be used to allow compliance between two portions of the arm. Spring compliance or deflection can be measured to determine the torque experienced at the joint.

The task being performed by the robotic arm determines the torque and deflection requirements of the robotic arm. Additionally the size of the robotic arm is determined by the work which the arm will be used for and size constraints that may be associated with the working environment. The size and the capacity of the torsion spring used in the joint are therefore dependent on these factors as well.

A torsion spring for a robot arm that can provide increased strength and deflection with a small width is desired. A torsion spring comprises an inner mounting segment. An outer mounting segment is located concentrically around the inner mounting segment. A plurality of splines extends from the inner mounting segment to the outer mounting segment. At least a portion of each spline extends generally annularly around the inner mounting segment.

A robot arm includes a robot joint having at least one drive component and an output link mounted to the robot joint. The torsion spring is located between the robot joint and the output link of the robot arm.

A method of operating the robot arm includes mounting the inner mounting segment of the torsion spring to the at least one drive component within the robot joint and mounting the outer mounting segment of the torsion spring to the output link of the robot arm. The method further includes moving the at least one drive component within the robot joint to rotate the inner mounting segment of the torsion spring relative to the outer mounting segment of the torsion spring. The relative rotation causes a plurality of splines to elastically deform. Releasing the at least one component within the robot joint allows the plurality of splines to return to the undeformed position and the inner mounting segment of the torsion spring to return to the original rotational position.

The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments and best modes for carrying out the present invention when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.

Referring to the Figures wherein like reference numbers refer to the same or similar components throughout the several views schematically illustrates a robot arm including a robot joint and an output link . A torsion spring is mounted on a first portion of the robot joint . The output link can be mounted to the torsion spring to form the robot arm .

The torsion spring has an inner mounting segment and an outer mounting segment . In the embodiment shown the inner mounting segment is a bolt circle formed by a first plurality of apertures as shown in . The first plurality of apertures shown in corresponds to drive components within the first portion of the robot joint . Bolts extend through the first plurality of apertures to attach the torsion spring to the drive components in the robot joint . The outer mounting segment is also a bolt circle formed by a second plurality of apertures . The second plurality of apertures corresponds to a link mounting segment . Bolts extend through the second plurality of apertures to attach the output link to the torsion spring .

A plurality of splines extend between the inner mounting segment and the outer mounting segment . In the embodiment shown there are two splines . The number of splines may be varied based upon the performance capacity required of the torsion spring . For example an increase in the number of splines may increase the spring rate of the torsion spring but decrease the rotational compliance of the torsion spring . One skilled in the art would be able to determine the proper number of splines to achieve the performance capacity desired for a particular application of the torsion spring .

The splines are attached to the inner mounting segment at a first portion and are attached to the outer mounting segment at a second portion . For each spline the first portion is attached to the inner mounting segment at a different circumferential position than the second portion is attached to the outer mounting segment . The first portion extends radially out from the inner mounting segment to a center portion . The second portion extends radially inward from the outer mounting segment to the center portion . The center portion extends generally annularly around the circumference of the inner mounting segment and within the circumference of the outer mounting segment . In the splines extend in a clockwise direction from the inner mounting segment to the outer mounting segment .

The splines each have a spline width . The spline width varies along the center portion . The spline width increases as the center portion approaches the first portion and the second portion and narrows in the middle of the center portion . By increasing or decreasing the average spline width the spring rate of the torsion spring may be changed. One skilled in the art would be able to determine the proper spring rate and spline width for a particular application of the torsion spring .

In operation the inner mounting segment is actively rotated by the drive components of the robot joint . The rotation of the inner mounting segment by the drive components will cause the outer mounting segment and the subsequent output link of the robot arm to rotate if there are no outside forces acting on the output link . However if outside forces are acting on the output link the splines will elastically deform causing relative motion between the inner mounting segment and outer mounting segment of the torsion spring as indicated by arrow of . Removing the net torque between the drive component and the output link will allow the splines to return to the undeformed position.

The splines allow for the relative rotational movement between the inner mounting segment and the outer mounting segment . Tabs protrude radially outward from the inner mounting segment . As the inner mounting segment is rotated relative to the outer mounting segment an outer surface of the tabs may contact extensions not shown on the output link to provide a positive stop for the torsion spring . In the embodiment shown for example the torsion spring may deflect up to 5 degrees when the maximum torque load is applied to the inner mounting segment . To prevent further deflection the tabs would contact the extensions on the output link of the robot arm at 5 degrees of deflection.

The torsion spring has a generally planar disc shape. The torsion spring defines a spring diameter and a spring thickness. The spring diameter is determined based upon the size of the bolt circle formed by the second plurality of apertures . The spring thickness may be varied to satisfy the capacity requirements of the torsion spring . An increase in the spring thickness causes a proportional increase in the stiffness of the torsion spring .

The splines are attached to the inner mounting segment at a first portion and are attached to the outer mounting segment at a second portion . For each spline the first portion is attached to the inner mounting segment at a different circumferential position than the second portion is attached to the outer mounting segment . The first portion extends radially out from the inner mounting segment to a center portion . The second portion extends radially inward from the outer mounting segment to the center portion . The center portion extends generally annularly around the circumference of the inner mounting segment and within the circumference of the outer mounting segment . The splines on the torsion spring extend in clockwise direction from the inner mounting segment to the outer mounting segment .

The splines each have a spline width . The spline width varies along the center portion . The spline width increases as the center portion approaches the first portion and the second portion and narrows in the middle of the center portion . The splines have a decreased average spline width when compared with the splines of . As discussed above by increasing or decreasing the average spline width the spring rate of the torsion spring may be changed. One skilled in the art would be able to determine the proper spring rate and spline width for a particular application of the torsion spring .
