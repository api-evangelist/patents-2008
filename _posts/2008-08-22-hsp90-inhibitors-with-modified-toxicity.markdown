The entire disclosure of each of these priority documents are hereby incorporated by reference.

This invention was made with government support under grant number CA051210 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.

This invention relates to geldanamycin derivatives as anti cancer compounds pharmaceutical compositions containing the same and methods of using the same in the treatment of neoplastic disorders and solid tumors in a mammal.

Hsp90 is a protein chaperone that utilizes the hydrolysis of ATP to assist in the folding of early nascent forms of proteins to their mature correctly folded forms. Once the protein has been correctly folded Hsp90 is released and thus it functions as a true protein catalyst. Hsp90 has also been recognized as an attractive anticancer target in that this chaperone assists in the folding of many oncogenic proteins including ErbB2 Raf 1 mutant p53 estrogen and steroid receptors. Thus by inhibiting Hsp90 a large number of downstream oncogenic proteins can be disrupted thereby attacking the neoplastic process at a number of points.

The first Hsp90 inhibitor used clinically was geldanamycin. Geldanamycin is a benzoquinone ansamycin polyketide isolated from . Although originally discovered by screening microbial extracts for antibacterial and antiviral activity geldanamycin was later found to be cytotoxic to tumor cells in vitro and to reverse the neoplastic morphology of cells transformed by the Rous sarcoma virus.

While there has been a great deal of research interest in the benzoquinone ansamycins particularly geldanamycin and 17 AAG there remains a need for effective derivatives of these compounds having higher activity without the significant risk of toxicity of the parent geldanamycin compound.

The present invention provides novel geldanamycin derivatives quinone and hydroquinone ansamycins modified at the 19 position of the geldanamycin molecule and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and prodrugs thereof that are potent Hsp90 binding agents with improved toxicity profiles relative to the parent quinones and hydroquinones. The 19 substituted benzoquinone and hydroquinone ansamycins of the present invention do not deplete glutathione and are therefore less hepatotoxic.

The present invention also provides methods of making and using these novel compounds as well as pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds.

It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that compounds of the invention having a chiral center may exist in and may be isolated in optically active and racemic forms. It is to be understood that the compounds of the present invention encompasses any racemic optically active regioisomeric or stereoisomeric form or mixtures thereof which possess the therapeutically useful properties described herein. It is well known in the art how to prepare optically active forms for example by resolution of the racemic form by recrystallization techniques by synthesis from optically active starting materials by chiral synthesis or by chromatographic separation using a chiral stationary phase . It is also to be understood that the scope of this invention encompasses not only the various isomers which may exist but also the various mixtures of isomers which may be formed. For example if the compound of the present invention contains one or more chiral centers the compound can be synthesized enantioselectively or a mixture of enantiomers and or diastereomers can be prepared and separated. The resolution of the compounds of the present invention their starting materials and or the intermediates may be carried out by known procedures e.g. as described in the four volume compendium Optical Resolution Procedures for Chemical Compounds Optical Resolution Information Center Manhattan College Riverdale N.Y. and in Enantiomers Racemates and Resolutions Jean Jacques Andre Collet and Samuel H. Wilen John Wiley Sons Inc. New York 1981 which is incorporated in its entirety by this reference. Basically the resolution of the compounds is based on the differences in the physical properties of diastereomers by attachment either chemically or enzymatically of an enantiomerically pure moiety resulting in forms that are separable by fractional crystallization distillation or chromatography.

Because the benzoquinone ansamycins contain a quinone moiety bioreduction of these compounds to form semiquinone and hydroquinone species is a possible metabolic pathway in tumor cells in the presence of the appropriate bioreductive enzymes. The present inventors have previously demonstrated that the active forms of these benzoquinone ansamycins are the reduced forms the hydroquinone ansamycins Guo W. Reigan P. Siegel D. Zirrolli J. Gustafson D. Ross D. 17 17 117 90 . Cancer Res. 65 21 10006 15 2005 Guo W. Reigan P. Siegel D. Zirrolli J. Gustafson D. Ross D. 1 90 Mol. Pharmacol. 70 4 1194 1203 2006 .

NQO1 DT diaphorase EC 1.6.99.2 is a flavoenzyme capable of utilizing either NADH or NADPH as reducing cofactors to catalyze the direct two electron reduction of quinones to hydroquinones. Thus amongst the bioreductive enzymes expressed in cancer cells NQO1 is poised to have the greatest influence on the metabolism and activation of the benzoquinone ansamycins to hydroquinones. NQO1 is expressed at high levels in many human cancers including lung colon stomach pancreatic and breast cancers and has been shown to increase the cytotoxicity of many quinone containing antitumor drugs such as AZQ mitomycin C E09 streptonigrin RH 1 and lapachone by reduction of these compounds to the corresponding hydroquinone species.

As noted above the use of benzoquinone ansamycins has been limited by hepatotoxicity. Without intending to be bound by any one theory it is believed that the hepatotoxicity may be a result of depletion of hepatic glutathione resulting from the participation of the benzoquinone ansamycins in both redox cycling and adduction reactions. Benzoquinone ansamycins can form glutathione adducts on the 19 position of the molecule the present inventors have isolated geldanamycin and 17 DMAG glutathione adducts after reaction of 17 AAG with reduced glutathione. The present inventors have also shown that the benzoquinone ansamycins can redox cycle to generate reactive oxygen species which also deplete glutathione. A reduction or elimination of the hepatotoxicity associated with these benzoquinone ansamycins in either the quinone or hydroquinone forms is believed to result from diminished hepatic glutathione depletion.

The compounds of the present invention may be prepared in a number of ways well known to one skilled in the art of organic synthesis. The compounds of the present invention can be synthesized using the methods described below together with synthetic methods known in the art of organic chemistry or variations thereon as appreciated by those skilled in the art. Preferred methods of synthesizing the 19 methyl substituted geldanamycin fall into two general categories. The first is a conjugate addition elimination strategy and the second is a palladium mediated sp2 sp3 cross coupling strategy. Both approaches start with the 19 bromo geldanamycin which is commercially available and utilize methyl organometallics e.g. MeMgBr that introduce the methyl group at the C 19 site. Details of these preferred synthesis methods are provided in Example 2 of this disclosure.

The compounds of this invention may be prepared using the reactions performed in solvents appropriate to the reagents and materials employed and suitable for the transformation being effected. Also in the description of the synthetic methods described below it is to be understood that all proposed reaction conditions including choice of solvents reaction temperature duration of the experiment and workup procedures are chosen to be the conditions standard for that reaction which should be readily recognized by one skilled in the art. It is understood by one skilled in the art of organic synthesis that the functionality present on various portions of the molecule must be compatible with the reagents and reactions proposed. Such restrictions to the substituents which are compatible with the reaction conditions will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art and alternate methods must then be used.

The benzoquinone ansamycin starting compound is available commercially from Invivogen. Preparation of 18 21 dixydroxy geldanamycin derivatives is described in detail in co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 218 320 U.S. Patent Publication No. 2006 0205705 A1 which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.

Therefore one embodiment of the present invention is a method of forming a 19 substituted benzoquinone ansamycin or a derivative thereof by treating a benzoquinone ansamycin or derivative as described in Example 1 and shown in . Another embodiment is a method of forming a 19 substituted benzoquinone or dihydroquinone ansamycin or a derivative thereof by treating a benzoquinone ansamycin or derivative as described in Example 2 and shown in .

Also provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions containing compounds of this invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which are media generally accepted in the art for the delivery of biologically active agents to animals in particular mammals. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are formulated according to a number of factors well within the purview of those of ordinary skill in the art to determine and accommodate. These include without limitation the type and nature of the active agent being formulated the subject to which the agent containing composition is to be administered the intended route of administration of composition and the therapeutic indication being targeted. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include both aqueous and non aqueous liquid media as well as a variety of solid and semi solid dosage forms. Such carriers can include a number of different ingredients and additives in addition to the active agent such additional ingredients being included in the formulation for a variety of reasons e.g. stabilization of the active agent well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Descriptions of suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and factors involved in their selection are found in a variety of readily available sources such as Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 17th ed. Mack Publishing Company Easton Pa. 1985.

The hydroquinone ansamycin derivatives of the present invention are relatively stable undergoing autoxidation to the corresponding quinone compound over time. This autoxidation occurs more rapidly in the presence of metal salts and particularly in the presence of copper. Therefore metal chelating agents can be used to prevent the autoxidation of the hydroquinone derivatives of the present invention. Thus one embodiment of the present invention is a method of reducing the autoxidation of a hydroquinone ansamycin derivative by storing the hydroquinone ansamycin derivative in the presence of a metal chelating agent. A related embodiment is a method of reducing the autoxidation of a hydroquinone ansamycin derivative by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a hydroquinone ansamycin derivative to a mammal in the presence of a metal chelating agent. A further embodiment of the invention is a pharmaceutical composition containing at least one of the ansamycin derivatives of the present invention and a metal chelating agent.

Unfortunately some metal chelating agents or sequestrating agents may interfere with the Hsp90 inhibitory activity of a hydroquinone ansamycin or may cause adverse effects of their own. Therefore preferred metal chelating agents and sequestrating agents of the present invention do not interfere with the activity of a hydroquinone ansamycin and do not produce toxic or other adverse events in an animal.

The metal chelating agent may be any compound that will bind metal ions without eliminating the activity of an ansamycin hydroquinone present in a composition containing the metal chelating agent. The addition of a protein metal chelating agent may minimize formulation problems encountered with hydroquinone drugs that result from formation of the corresponding quinone by autoxidation of the hydroquinone.

Exemplary metal chelating agents suitable for use in the methods and compositions of the present invention are proteins hereinafter referred to as protein metal chelating agents. Preferably these protein metal chelating agents contain the ACTUN protein motif. This protein motif was characterized by Harford et al Acc. Chem. Res 30 123 in 1997 and is characterized by a free amino terminus a histidine residue in 3rd position and two intervening peptide nitrogens. A particularly preferred protein metal chelating agent containing the ACTUN protein motif that is useful in the methods and compositions of the present invention is albumin and more preferably human albumin. Therefore a preferred embodiment of the present invention is a composition containing an ansamycin hydroquinone and a protein metal chelating agent having an ACTUN motif. A preferred embodiment is a composition containing an ansamycin hydroquinone and albumin and more preferably a composition containing an ansamycin hydroquinone and human albumin.

This invention further provides a method of treating a mammal afflicted with a cancer or proliferative disorder which includes administering to the mammal a pharmaceutical composition provided herein. Such compositions generally comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a compound provided herein that is an amount effective to ameliorate lessen inhibit or destroy neoplastic tissue. Such amounts typically comprise from about 0.1 to about 1000 mg of the compound per kilogram of body weight of the mammal to which the composition is administered. Therapeutically effective amounts can be administered according to any dosing regimen satisfactory to those of ordinary skill in the art.

Administration is for example by various parenteral means. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for parenteral administration include various aqueous media such as aqueous dextrose and saline solutions glycol solutions are also useful carriers and preferably contain a water soluble salt of the active ingredient suitable stabilizing agents and if necessary buffering agents. Antioxidizing agents such as sodium bisulfite sodium sulfite or ascorbic acid either alone or in combination are suitable stabilizing agents also used are citric acid and its salts and EDTA. In addition parenteral solutions can contain preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride methyl or propyl paraben and chlorobutanol.

Alternatively compositions can be administered orally in solid dosage forms such as capsules tablets and powders or in liquid forms such as elixirs syrups and or suspensions. Gelatin capsules can be used to contain the active ingredient and a suitable carrier such as but not limited to lactose starch magnesium stearate stearic acid or cellulose derivatives. Similar diluents can be used to make compressed tablets. Both tablets and capsules can be manufactured as sustained release products to provide for continuous release of medication over a period of time. Compressed tablets can be sugar coated or film coated to mask any unpleasant taste or used to protect the active ingredients from the atmosphere or to allow selective disintegration of the tablet in the gastrointestinal tract.

Additional objects advantages and novel features of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following examples thereof which are not intended to be limiting.

19 Bromo geldanamycin analogues were readily synthesized from commercially available geldanamycin by electrophilic bromination with pyridium perbromide as shown in .

Two synthetic approaches can be utilized for the synthesis of 19 methyl substituted geldanamycin derivatives a conjugate addition elimination strategy and a palladium mediated sp2 sp3 cross coupling strategy. Referring to both approaches start with the readily available 19 BrGA.

The addition elimination procedure requires an organometallic species that will selectively attack at the C 19 site in preference to the C 1 C 3 C 5 C 16 C 17 C 18 C 20 C 21 or the carbamic acid residue. The reagents MeMgBr MeLi in the presence of CuCl and Fe acac in the presence of MeMgBr can be utilized in tetrahydrofuran THF solvent at 0 C.

The sp2 sp3 cross coupling strategy utilizes the Pd Ph reagent in the presence of either CuCl and MeSn or in the presence of trimethylboroxine and KCO in 1 4 dioxane solvent at 100 C. This approach has the added advantage that the quinone could also be reduced to the dihydroquinone to give aromatic bromides which are well known to participate in palladium mediated methylations shown in . The dihydroquinone could be reoxidised to the quinone or functionalised on the oxygen atoms as shown in .

Benzoquinone ansamycins BAs can be metabolized by one electron reductases that interact with glutathione and these reactions have been associated with hepatotoxicity. Using a series of BAs the ability of BAs to be metabolized by one electron reductases and their conjugation with glutathione was investigated. The BAs used were geldanamycin GM 17 allylamino 17 demethoxygeldanamycin 17AAG 17 demthoxy 17 2 dimethylamino ethyl amino geldanamycin 17DMAG 17 amino 17 demethoxygeldanamycin 17AG and 17 demethoxy 17 2 pyrrolidin 1 yl ethyl amino geldanamycin.

Using human and mouse liver microsomes and either NADPH or NADH as cofactors the relative one electron redox cycling rates of BAs mediated by NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase were determined by measuring the rates of oxygen consumption. The rates of oxygen consumption and NAD P H oxidation were measured as indicators of the relative redox cycling rates of BAs. Reaction conditions were 50 M BA 500 M NADPH and 3.3 g of NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase were incubated in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 3 ml at 35 C. The oxygen consumption rate was measured using a Clark electrode air tight over 10 min. The results show that in this series of BAs 17AAG was metabolized at the slowest rate whereas GM was metabolized at a relatively rapid rate during either NADPH or NADH dependent metabolism in human and mouse liver microsomes.

The concentration of benzoquinone ansamycins and hydroquinone ansamycins formed in microsomal incubations was determined using HPLC. For GM and 17AAG the concentration of GMH2 and 17AAGH2 in microsomal incubations was also determined using standard curves generated by HPLC. Briefly mixtures containing 50 M GM or 17AAG 500 M NADH and 3.3 g rhNQO1 were incubated in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 1 ml . The reactions were stopped with an equal volume of ice cold methanol at 0 0.5 1 2 and 5 min for GM or 0 1 5 10 and 30 min for 17AAG and analyzed using HPLC. The amount of quinone remaining at the various time points was determined using standard curves. The amount of hydroquinone formed at the various time points was obtained by subtraction from the starting concentration of quinone. 17DMAG demonstrated the greatest rate of redox cycling catalyzed by purified human cytochrome P450 reductase whereas 17AAG again had the slowest rate.

The interaction of BAs including GM 17DMAG 17AAG 17AG and 17AEP GA with glutathione was measured by HPLC and further confirmed by LC MS . Reaction conditions were 50 M BA and 5 mM GSH were incubated in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 1 ml at room temperature in the absence and presence of 11.8 g of rhNQO1 and 500 M NADH. BA GSH conjugate formation was analyzed by HPLC at 270 nm and further confirmed by LC MS. The amount of BA glutathione conjugate formation was quantified using 3H glutathione. In reactions in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 and room temperature using 5 mM reduced glutathione and 50 M BA approximately 45 M GMH2 SG conjugate was formed within 5 mM which then slowly oxidized to GM SG A . This indicates formation via a classic 1 4 reductive Michael addition generating the hydroquinone conjugate intermediates which are then oxidized to quinone conjugates. Under the same conditions approximately 47 M 17DMAG SG conjugate was formed within 4 h whereas 17DMAGH2 SG was not detected A . This is likely because of the instability of 17DMAGH2 SG conjugate and its rapid oxidation to 17DMAG SG during analysis. The identity of glutathione adducts was confirmed by LC MS analysis D and D . Conversely the formation of 17AAG SG and 17AG SG was very slow under these conditions. Even after 24 h less than 15 of 17AAG or 17AG was conjugated with glutathione. Under the same conditions about 90 of 17AEP GA was conjugated with glutathione within 10 h. The relative rate of glutathione conjugate formation in this series of BAs was GM 17DMAG 17AEP GA 17AAG and 17AG. BA glutathione conjugate formation was pH dependent and glutathione conjugates were not formed when the pH was 

These data demonstrate that GM the most hepatotoxic BA in the series had a greater propensity to undergo redox cycling reactions catalyzed by hepatic one electron reductases and displayed markedly greater reactivity with thiols when compared with the least hepatotoxic analog 17AAG. Therefore minimizing the propensity of BA derivatives to undergo one electron reduction and glutathione conjugation while maximizing their two electron reduction to stable Hsp90 inhibitory hydroquinones which are properties of the 19 substituted geldanamycin derivatives of the present invention is a useful strategy for optimizing the therapeutic index of BAs.
