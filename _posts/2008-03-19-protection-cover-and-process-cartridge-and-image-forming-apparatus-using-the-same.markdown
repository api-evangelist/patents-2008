This application is based on and claims priority under 35 USC 119 from Japanese Patent Application Nos. 2007 243152 2007 243153 and 2007 243154 filed on Sep. 19 2007 Sep. 19 2007 and Sep. 20 2007 respectively.

The present invention relates to a protection cover and a process cartridge and an image forming apparatus using the same.

According to an aspect of the invention there is provided a protection cover which is detachably disposed in a process cartridge that is detachably inserted and mounted to an image forming apparatus housing body and that includes a photosensitive member protects an external exposure portion of the photosensitive member before the process cartridge is inserted and mounted to the image forming apparatus housing body and which detaches from the process cartridge with the process cartridge being inserted and mounted to the image forming apparatus housing body the protection cover including a cover base that covers and protects the external exposure portion of the photosensitive member and that comes into contact with the image forming apparatus housing body to movably guide the process cartridge at the time the process cartridge is inserted to the image forming apparatus housing body an extrusion member that is disposed in the cover base on a side opposite to an insertion direction of the process cartridge to the image forming apparatus housing body and that moves in the insertion direction of the process cartridge to extrude the process cartridge from the cover base and a restriction portion that is disposed in the extrusion member to restrict the process cartridge in the cover base in a state where the process cartridge is located in the cover base and to release the process cartridge from the cover base in a state where the process cartridge is inserted and mounted to the image forming apparatus housing body.

In the same drawing the protection cover according to the embodiment is detachably inserted and mounted to an image forming apparatus housing body and is detachably mounted to the process cartridge which contains at least a photosensitive member . The protection cover protects an external exposure portion of the photosensitive member before the process cartridge is inserted and mounted to the image forming apparatus housing body and is detached from the process cartridge when the process cartridge is inserted and mounted to the image forming apparatus housing body . The protection cover includes a cover base which covers the external exposure portion of the photosensitive member of the process cartridge to be protected and which comes into contact with the image forming apparatus housing body to movably guide the process cartridge at the time the process cartridge is inserted to the image forming apparatus housing body an extrusion member which is disposed in the cover base on the opposite side of the insertion direction where the process cartridge is inserted to the image forming apparatus housing body and which moves in the insertion direction of the process cartridge to extrude the process cartridge from the cover base and a restriction portion which is disposed in the extrusion member so that the process cartridge is restricted in the cover base in the state where the process cartridge is located in the cover base and the process cartridge is released from the cover base in the state where the process cartridge is inserted and mounted to the image forming apparatus housing body .

Additionally is a schematic view illustrating a state just before the process cartridge is inserted and mounted to the image forming apparatus housing body and is a schematic view illustrating a state after the process cartridge is inserted and mounted to the image forming apparatus housing body .

In such technical means the process cartridge is integrally formed with a unit containing at least the photosensitive member to thereby form a cartridge. The cartridge unit is configured to be detachably mounted to the image forming apparatus housing body .

Additionally in order to mainly protect the photosensitive member from deterioration or a damage an example of the protection cover includes a protection cover that protects at least the external exposure portion of the photosensitive member before the process cartridge is inserted and mounted to the image forming apparatus housing body and is detached from the process cartridge after the process cartridge is inserted and mounted thereto.

At this time at least the external exposure portion of the photosensitive member is protected means that the external exposure portion of the photosensitive member is included as a protection target to be protected by the protection cover . Examples of the protection cover include a protection cover that covers the whole external exposure portion of the photosensitive member and a protection cover that covers a part of the external exposure portion of the photosensitive member and a protection member sheet or film disposed in the protection cover may cover the rest of the external exposure portion of the photosensitive member

Additionally before the process cartridge is inserted and mounted to the image forming apparatus housing body broadly means a state before the process cartridge is inserted and mounted to the image forming apparatus housing body . Examples thereof include a case where the process cartridge is shipped and conveyed and a case where the process cartridge is inserted and mounted. Further inserting mounting operation indicates that an inserting operation is carried out to thereby realize a mounting operation. As a time point of mounting the protection cover to the process cartridge an example of the time point include of course a case where the protection cover is mounted to the process cartridge at the time the process cartridge is shipped and conveyed but the time point is not limited thereto. For example an example of the time point includes a case where the process cartridge is protected by a protection sheet other than the protection cover at the time of a shipment conveyance of the process cartridge and the protection sheet are detached therefrom just before the process cartridge is inserted and mounted to the image forming apparatus to mount the protection cover to the process cartridge .

In addition the protection cover may include the cover base the extrusion member and the restriction portion .

At this time examples of the cover base include a cover base that entirely surrounds the process cartridge and an appropriate cover base so long as the cover base covers at least the photosensitive member and comes into contact with the image forming apparatus housing body to movably guide the process cartridge at the time the process cartridge is inserted to the image forming apparatus housing body .

In addition examples of a guide portion of the process cartridge include a guide portion with a rail shape and a guide portion that appropriately uses a wall surface of the cover base so long as the process cartridge engages with the guide portion so as to move relatively.

An example of the extrusion member includes an extrusion member that is disposed on the opposite side of the insertion direction where the process cartridge is inserted to the image forming apparatus housing body so as to extrude the process cartridge in the insertion direction which is used as an operation member at the time the process cartridge is inserted and mounted to the image forming apparatus housing body .

An example of the restriction portion includes a restriction portion that restricts the process cartridge in the cover base in a state where the process cartridge is located in the cover base that is a state just before the process cartridge is inserted and mounted to the image forming apparatus housing body and releases the restriction state after the process cartridge is inserted and mounted thereto.

A desirable example of the protection cover for realizing the restriction and release of the restriction portion includes a protection cover that has a guide surface on which the extrusion member is guided such that at least a part of the guide surface has an ascending slope portion in the insertion direction where the process cartridge is inserted to the image forming apparatus housing body so as to change a relative position between the restriction portion and the process cartridge .

Additionally the release operation of the restriction portion by the use of the extrusion member can be carried out not only by the method of using the slope portion described above but also by a method of releasing the restriction state between the process cartridge and the restriction portion at a position where the process cartridge is inserted and mounted to the image forming apparatus housing body . In this example it is not important whether the extrusion member is detached from the protection cover .

A desirable example of the protection cover includes a protection cover that can position and hold the protection cover to the image forming apparatus housing body .

An example of a positioning holding structure of such a protection cover includes a positioning holding structure that includes a positioning holding portion which is disposed in the cover base on the side where the process cartridge is inserted to the image forming apparatus housing body to position and hold the cover base so as not to be drawn therefrom upon inserting and mounting the process cartridge thereto and to release the positioning holding state after the process cartridge is inserted and mounted thereto. At this time the extrusion member releases the holding state of the positioning holding portion at an extrusion end position at the time the extrusion member ends the inserting mounting operation of the process cartridge .

Such a positioning holding portion needs to have a positioning function and a holding function but is not necessarily limited to a positioning holding portion in which both functions are assigned to the same position. For example there is a positioning holding portion in which the positioning portion and the hold portion are separately provided such that a positioning function is realized at the positioning portion and the holding function for preventing a drawing operation is realized at the hold portion so that both portions realize the positioning function and the holding function. Additionally of course a simple positioning portion may be added to the positioning holding portion .

At this time in the positioning holding portion positioning holding operation to prevent a drawing operation means a holding state where the cover base cannot be drawn. Meanwhile the positioning holding state can be released after the insertion mounting of the process cartridge broadly means not only a time point when the insertion mounting of the process cartridge ends but also a time point when the holding state can be released afterward. In this case a desirable example of release means includes release means that carries out a release operation in accordance with an inserting mounting operation of the process cartridge but also an example thereof includes release means that carries out a release operation independently from the inserting mounting operation of the process cartridge .

A desirable example of the positioning holding portion includes a positioning holding portion which carries out both the positioning function and the holding function for preventing a drawing operation of the cover base . A typical example includes a positioning holding portion in which the positioning holding portion has an elastic hold piece which is elastically deformable so as to be hooked in a positioning hole formed in the image forming apparatus housing body and to thereby be fixed and held therein. However it is desirable that such a positioning holding portion has a position regulation mechanism for restricting the extrusion member in the extrusion end position at the time the inserting mounting operation of the process cartridge ends so as to efficiently prevent a case where the extrusion member is pushed back by a reaction force of the positioning holding portion .

Additionally in a viewpoint of reducing an extrusion operation force of the extrusion member it is desirable that the restriction portion includes a pair of elastic restriction pieces which are elastically deformable and the elastic restriction piece is provided with a flange portion which comes into contact with the blocking portion of the cover base so as to elastically deform the pair of elastic restriction pieces to fall inward. At this time at least two steps of slope guide surfaces are formed in a portion of the flange portion which comes into contact with the blocking portion of the cover base . Also it is desirable that the angle formed between the subsequent slope guide surface and the blocking portion is set to be smaller than that formed between the initial slope guide surface and the blocking portion with respect to the extrusion direction of the extrusion member .

At this time it is desirable that an angle formed between the initial slope guide surface and the blocking portion is set so that a component force can support the self weight of the process cartridge .

The embodiment provides not only such a protection cover but also the process cartridge using the protection cover or the image forming apparatus.

Hereinafter an exemplary embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.

In the same drawing in the image forming apparatus image forming units specifically to of four colors in the embodiment black yellow magenta and cyan are arranged in the inside of an image forming apparatus housing body hereinafter referred to as an apparatus housing body in the width direction so as to be obliquely upward and slightly inclined. An intermediate transfer belt which moves in circulation in the arrangement direction of the image forming units is disposed thereabove. Additionally a printing sheet supply unit in which printing sheets to be supplied are received is disposed below the apparatus housing body . A printing medium ejection receive unit which receives a printing sheet on which an image forming operation is performed is disposed above the apparatus housing body . A printing sheet supplied from the printing sheet supply unit is ejected to the printing medium ejection receive unit through a conveyance passage which extends vertically.

In the embodiment each of the image forming units to as shown in forms toner images of for example black yellow magenta and cyan the arrangement is not necessarily limited to this sequence in a sequential manner from the upstream side of the circulation direction of the intermediate transfer belt . For example each of the image forming units includes a photosensitive member with a drum shape a charger which charges the photosensitive member in advance an exposure which forms an electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive member charged by the charger a developer unit which visualizes the electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive member with each color toner and a cleaner which cleans a residual toner on the photosensitive member .

At this time the exposure is common to each of the image forming units . Light from a light source such as a semiconductor laser not shown of each color component in an exposure container is deflectably radiated by a deflection mirror and then a light image is derived to an exposure position of the corresponding photosensitive member through an imaging lens and a mirror which are not shown.

The intermediate belt is suspended on tight suspension rolls to and for example the tight suspension roll is configured to be moved in circulation by a drive roll. In the rear surface of the intermediate transfer belt corresponding to each of the photosensitive members a first transfer unit i.e. a first transfer roll is disposed. Upon applying a voltage with polarity which is opposite to charge polarity of the toner to the first transfer unit the toner image on the photosensitive member is configured to be electrostatically transferred to the intermediate transfer belt

In a position corresponding to the tight suspension roll on the downstream side of the image forming unit which is located at the downmost side of the moving direction of the intermediate transfer belt a second transfer unit i.e. a second transfer roll is disposed and a second transfer one shot transfer of the first transfer image on the intermediate transfer belt is configured to be performed on a printing sheet.

In a position corresponding to the tight suspension roll on the downstream side of the second transfer region of the intermediate transfer belt an intermediate cleaner which cleans a residual toner on the intermediate transfer belt is disposed.

At this time the intermediate transfer belt is formed such that an appropriate amount of a charge prevention material such as a carbon black is contained in resin such as polyimide polycarbonate polyester and polypropylene or various type of rubber so that volume resistivity is in the range of 10to 10 cm.

In the embodiment a printing sheet supplied from a feeder of the printing sheet supply unit is conveyed to an appropriate number of conveyance rolls not shown in the course of the printing sheet conveyance passage and is positioned by a positioning roll Subsequently the printing sheet passes through the second transfer region of the second transfer unit so that a non fixed toner image is fixed by a fixing unit under heat and pressurization and then is ejected and received in the printing medium ejection receive unit through an ejection roll .

Additionally in Reference Numeral to denotes a toner supply unit which supplies a new toner to the developer unit of each image forming unit to .

In particular in the embodiment as shown in the photosensitive member includes a process cartridge which is incorporated with the charger and the cleaner . The process cartridge is detachably mounted to the apparatus housing body so as to configure a part of the image forming unit of each color component.

At this time the charger includes a charger container of which a portion opposed to the photosensitive member is opened and a charge roll which comes into contact with a surface of the photosensitive member or which is close thereto is disposed in the charge container .

The cleaner includes a cleaner container of which a portion opposed to the photosensitive member is opened. At this time in one edge portion in the longitudinal direction of the cleaner container an elastic scrape plate which comes into contact with the photosensitive member is disposed. In the other edge portion in the longitudinal direction of the cleaner container an elastic seal material which comes into contact with the photosensitive member is disposed. In the cleaner container a uniform conveyance member which allows residual materials such as a toner scraped by the elastic scrape plate to be uniform in the longitudinal direction is disposed.

For this reason in the embodiment in the process cartridge as shown in a part of the vicinity of the photosensitive member is covered with the charger and the cleaner and the rest of the vicinity of the photosensitive member is directly exposed as an exposure portion M.

In the embodiment the developer is mounted to the apparatus housing body separately from the process cartridge is opposed to the photosensitive member to be opened thereto and includes a developer container which contains a developer having at least a toner. In the opening of the developer container a developer hold body which can convey a developer toward a developer region located at a position opposed to the photosensitive member is disposed. In the rear surface of the developer hold body of the developer container a pair of developer mix conveyance members and which can convey the developer while being circulated and mixed are disposed. Between the developer hold body and the developer mix conveyance member disposed on the side of the developer hold body a developer supply member which can supply the mixed conveyed developer to the developer hold body is disposed. Also the developer supplied to the developer hold body is regulated by a layer thickness regulation member to be a predetermined layer thickness and then is supplied to the developer region.

In the embodiment the process cartridge as shown in includes a cartridge frame which is formed of plastic such as ABS resin. The cartridge frame is incorporated with the photosensitive member the charger and the cleaner .

The configuration of the process cartridge is not limited to the above described example but can be applied to an example in which a monochromatic image is formed.

The example of the process cartridge is not limited to the above described example but also includes an example in which only the photosensitive member is in a form of a cartridge an example in which the photosensitive member and the charger are integrally formed with each other so as to be detachably mounted to the apparatus housing body an example in which the photosensitive member and the developer unit are integrally formed with each other so as to be detachably mounted to the apparatus housing body an example in which the photosensitive member and the cleaner are integrally formed with each other so as to be detachably mounted to the apparatus housing body and an example in which two or more of the photosensitive member and the above described process device are combined with each other so as to configure a single cartridge and to be detachably mounted to the apparatus housing body .

In the embodiment in the process cartridge the charger and the cleaner are disposed in the lower portion than the horizontal line containing the center of the photosensitive member in the gravity direction. In this manner since the charger is disposed below the photosensitive member a part of the cartridge frame can be used as a positioning portion for performing a positioning operation to a protection cover described below or a guide portion for performing a guide portion upon being inserted to the apparatus housing body . Accordingly it is possible to reduce the number of the positioning portions and the guide portions which are necessarily provided in addition and thus it is advantageous to realize a space saving and the reduction in the number of components which have been strongly demanded.

In the embodiment in the process cartridge the charger and the cleaner are disposed in the lower portion than the horizontal line containing the center of the photosensensitive member in the gravity direction. In this manner since the charger is disposed below the photosensitive member a part of the cartridge frame can be used as a positioning portion for performing a positioning operation to a protection cover described below or a guide operation for performing a guide operation upon being inserted to the apparatus housing body . Accordingly it is possible to reduce the number of the positioning portions and the guide portions which are necessarily provided in addition and thus it is advantageous to realize a space saving and the reduction in the number of components which have been strongly demanded.

In the embodiment as shown in the process cartridge includes the protection cover before the process cartridge is inserted and mounted to the apparatus housing body .

The protection cover protects the exposure portion M see of the photosensitive member of the process cartridge and is detachably mounted to the process cartridge so as to be detached therefrom after the process cartridge is inserted and mounted to the apparatus housing body .

In the embodiment the protection cover is formed in a substantially hollow rectangular parallelepiped shape so as to surround the process cartridge and includes a cover base which extends in the longitudinal direction. The cover base is integrally made of plastic such as ABS resin.

Additionally the cover base is provided with a guide portion a guide rail see and a guide inner wall in a position corresponding to a guide protrusion of the cartridge frame or the outer wall of the charger container of the charger . That is in the example the guide rail is disposed in the inner side of the bottom wall of the cover base so as to slidably move the guide protrusion of the cartridge frame . Additionally the guide inner wall is disposed in the inner surface of the side wall of the cover base so as to slidably move the outer wall of the charger container of the charger so that the insertion posture of the process cartridge is regulated.

In the embodiment as shown in and the upper wall of the cover base of the protection cover is provided with a guide slit in the longitudinal direction of the cover base . The guide slit is formed in a longitudinal shape in which the edge of the cover base on the side of the apparatus housing body is opened. At this time an operation lever for extruding the process cartridge in the protection cover is configured to be slidably movable in the guide slit .

In the embodiment the operation lever includes a lever main body see which can slidably move in the guide slit . The lever main body is provided with a stopper with a flange shape which slidably moves along the edge portion of the guide slit . Also the lever main body is provided with a connection piece i.e. see which is connectable to a connection receive portion i.e. see of the cartridge frame of the process cartridge .

Additionally the vicinity of the end opening of the guide slit is provided with a retaining step member which comes into contact with the stopper of the operation lever . Further the width of the end opening of the guide slit is set to be narrower than that of other slit portions.

In the embodiment the connection piece of the operation lever restricts the process cartridge at the time the process cartridge is located in the protection cover by the use of a restriction mechanism described below and releases the restriction state between the process cartridge and the connection piece at the time of the inserting mounting operation of the process cartridge to the cartridge receive portion of the apparatus housing body .

In the embodiment since the guide slit as a gap exists in the protection cover a problem arises in that light from the guide slit is incident to the inside of the protection cover to thereby deteriorate the photosensitive member . Accordingly in the embodiment the protection cover is additionally provided with a flexible protection sheet and thus it is possible to prevent light from the guide slit from being incident thereto. Like the embodiment in the case where the charger charge roll using a contact charge method is formed in a unit as the process cartridge a problem arises in that the photosensitive member is friction charged by the charge roll during a conveyance and the like. In this case since the flexible protection sheet is disposed between the photosensitive member and the charge roll the contact charge is prevented. Since at least a part of the flexible protection sheet is exposed to the outside of the protection cover through the guide slit the deterioration of the photosensitive member is reduced and the friction charge of the photosensitive member is prevented by the charge roll . Accordingly it is possible to easily detach the flexible protection sheet at the time of the inserting operation of the process cartridge .

Additionally the cover base is provided with a positioning holding mechanism on the insertion side of the process cartridge to the apparatus housing body .

The positioning holding mechanism positions and holds the cover base so as not to be drawn therefrom at the time of the inserting mounting operation of the process cartridge and release the positioning holding state after the inserting mounting operation of the process cartridge .

In the embodiment as shown in and the positioning holding mechanism includes a pair of positioning holding pieces and are disposed on both sides of one end in the longitudinal direction of the cover base . The positioning holding pieces and includes an elastic protrusion piece which protrudes from an end portion of the cover base in the longitudinal direction to the apparatus housing body so as to be elastically deformable and a hook claw with a hook shape is integrally formed with the front end of the elastic protrusion piece . At this time the elastic protrusion piece is formed in a plate shape in which the thickness is thin in the thickness direction the thickness of the elastic protrusion piece in the arrow A direction and the free end is movable in the substantially horizontal direction which corresponds to the arrow A direction .

Meanwhile as shown in a pair of positioning holes and are disposed in the edge of the circumference of the opening of the cartridge receive portion of the apparatus housing body . Particularly in the embodiment the apparatus housing body includes a plurality of cartridge receive portions and the positioning hole on the other side of the predetermined cartridge receive portion serves as the positioning hole on one side of the cartridge receive portion adjacent thereto.

Additionally the positioning holding pieces and of the protection cover is inserted to the positioning holes and of each cartridge receive portion while being elastically deformed in a direction where the positioning holding pieces and are spaced from each other so that a positioning operation is carried out. Additionally the hook claws of the positioning holding pieces and are held in the edge of the positioning holes and so as not to be drawn therefrom. At this time the elastic deformation means a degree how the positioning holding pieces and of the protection cover are deformed by a mounting force occurring when being mounted to the positioning holes and .

In the embodiment particularly as shown in the guide slit has a taper portion of which the opening width sequentially becomes smaller toward the end opening in front of the retaining step member . As shown by the arrow B in the taper portion serves to widen outwardly the protection cover with the guide slit interposed therebetween at the time the operation lever reaches the taper portion and as described below to release the holding state between the positioning holes and and the positioning holding pieces and .

Next a mounting method of the process cartridge using the positioning holding mechanism will be described below.

First the positioning holding pieces and disposed in the protection cover are inserted to the positioning holes and in the edge of the opening of the cartridge receive portions of the apparatus housing body see .

At this time as shown in the positioning holding pieces and are inserted to the positioning holes and while being elastically deformed as shown by the arrow A and then are hooked by the hook claw . Subsequently the protection cover and the process cartridge are positioned and held to the apparatus housing body so as not be drawn therefrom.

In this state the protection cover is positioned to the apparatus housing body . Also even when a hand is detached from the protection cover the protection cover is fixed thereto so as not to be drawn therefrom at the time of the inserting operation of the process cartridge .

In the embodiment the positioning holding pieces and are fitted to the positioning holes and on the side of the apparatus housing body . Additionally the end portion of the protection cover comes into contact with the opening protrusion portion of the cartridge receive portion of the apparatus housing body . Accordingly even when a hand is detached from the protection cover at the time of the inserting operation of the process cartridge it is possible to reduce a slope in the insertion direction where the process cartridge is inserted to the apparatus housing body .

Afterward as shown in when the operation lever is extruded in the insertion direction of the process cartridge so as to follow the guide slit disposed in the protection cover the guide portion guide protrusion and guide outer wall disposed in the process cartridge is guided by the guide rail and the guide inner wall disposed in the protection cover and the guide portion guide rail and guide inner wall disposed in the apparatus housing body to be thereby inserted to the apparatus housing body .

In the embodiment as shown in the guide slit includes the taper portion in front of the retaining step member of which the gap is narrowed. When the operation lever is extruded to a position of the taper portion of which the gap is narrowed as shown by B in the protection cover is widened outwardly with the guide slit interposed therebetween. Accordingly the positioning holding pieces and hooked by the positioning holes and are widened outwardly as shown by the arrow C in . As a result in accordance with the inserting operation of the process cartridge it is possible to release the positioning holding state where the drawing operation is not permitted by the positioning holding pieces and .

In particular in the embodiment since the positioning holding pieces and are fixed to the apparatus housing body by the use of the hook claw therein it is possible to carry out the detaching operation when the fixation of the protection cover is released.

Likewise since the taper portion for releasing the holding state of the positioning holding pieces and is disposed in the vicinity of the guide slit on the side of the apparatus housing body as shown in the fixation state positioning state of the protection cover with respect to the apparatus housing body is released after the process cartridge is mounted to the apparatus housing body .

Accordingly the process cartridge is slidably guided by the guide rail and the guide inner wall of the protection cover in the longitudinal direction and thus the process cartridge is inserted to the inside of the apparatus housing body .

In the embodiment a restriction mechanism see for restricting the process cartridge in the protection cover is provided.

The restriction mechanism is provided so that the process cartridge is restricted in the cover base in the state where the process cartridge is located in the cover base and the process cartridge is released from the cover base in the state where the process cartridge is inserted and mounted to the apparatus housing body .

In this example as shown in the operation lever includes the stopper and the connection piece in the lever main body . Meanwhile as shown in the cartridge frame of the process cartridge is provided with the connection receive portion with a concave shape to which the connection piece can be fitted.

At this time the restriction mechanism used in the example fitly connects the connection piece of the operation lever to the connection receive portion of the process cartridge and restricts the process cartridge in the protection cover in the state where the operation lever is located at the initial position of the protection cover .

In particular in the embodiment the operation lever is disposed so as to be slidably movable along the guide slit of the protection cover and the stopper with a flange shape is configured to be slidably movable in the edge of the opening of the guide slit of the protection cover through the guide surface .

The guide surface includes the slope portion which is upwardly inclined toward the insertion direction where the process cartridge is inserted to the apparatus housing body . The slope portion is inclined by q so that the height dimension is displaced by h with respect to a distance L where the operation lever is pushed from the initial position to the extrusion end position.

In this example the height dimension is expressed by h L tan but the height dimension h is set to be larger than a hook degree D how the connection piece of the operation lever is hooked by the connection receive portion of the process cartridge .

Accordingly in the embodiment as shown in B and in the restriction mechanism when the operation lever is moved by L from the initial position to the extrusion end position a relative position of the operation lever with respect to the process cartridge is changed by the slope portion of the guide surface . Accordingly as shown in the connection piece of the operation lever is detached from the connection receive portion of the process cartridge and thus the connection state therebetween is released.

For this reason as shown in when the operation lever reaches the extrusion end position the restriction state where the process cartridge is restricted in the protection cover by the restriction mechanism is released. Accordingly the process cartridge is detached from the protection cover and thus is inserted and mounted to the cartridge receive portion of the apparatus housing body .

The restriction mechanism in the example has substantially the same configuration as that of the typical example 1 shown in but is different in that an initial position restriction mechanism see restricts the movement of the operation lever in the operation direction when the operation lever is located at the initial position.

The initial position restriction mechanism includes blocking ribs see on both sides of the guide slit of the protection cover in a position corresponding to the initial position of the operation lever and hooks a part of the operation lever on the blocking rib to restrict the movement of the operation lever .

As shown in in the operation lever used in the example a leg portion which is fitted to the guide slit is disposed in the lower portion of a gripper portion and the connection piece which is fitted to a connection receive portion of the process cartridge is disposed in a part of the leg portion .

The leg portion of the operation lever includes a pair of elastic restriction pieces which are fitted to the guide slit . The lower portion of the elastic restriction piece is formed in an elastically deformable plate shape at a cantilever point. In the outside of the free end of the elastic restriction piece a flange portion which comes into contact with the blocking rib to elastically deform the pair of elastic restriction pieces so as to fall inward is disposed. In a portion of the flange portion which comes into contact with the blocking rib at least two steps of slope guide surfaces and are disposed.

At this time as shown in an angle formed between the initial slope guide surface and the blocking rib is set to be larger than an angle formed between the subsequent slope guide surface and the blocking rib with respect to the operation direction extrusion direction of the operation lever .

More specifically the angle of the initial slope guide surface of the flange portion is set in consideration of bend rigidity of the elastic restriction piece so as to receive a component force which can support the self weight of the process cartridge . The angle of the subsequent slope guide surface of the flange portion is set in a direction where the component force can be lower than that of the component force of the angle .

In the embodiment the operation lever is detachably mounted to the initial position of the guide slit . In the outer surface of the elastic restriction piece a guide protrusion portion which is fitted to a guide groove portion formed in the initial position of the guide slit is provided.

Accordingly in the embodiment for example even when the process cartridge is loaded in the protection cover and the opening of the protection cover faces the downside since the initial slope guide surface of the flange portion of the operation lever comes into contact with the blocking rib by the initial position restriction mechanism the operation lever is restricted by the blocking rib so as not to move.

In the embodiment since the initial position restriction mechanism includes two steps of slope guide surfaces and formed in the flange portion it is possible to reduce the extrusion operation force of the operation lever at the time of carrying out an extrusion operation of the operation lever .

In the embodiment a position regulation mechanism for restricting a position of the operation lever at the extrusion end position is provided.

As shown in the position regulation mechanism includes a step portion provided on the side of the opening of the taper portion of the guide slit of the protection cover . When the operation lever is pushed to the extrusion end position as shown in a notch end portion provided in a part of the leg portion of the operation lever is hooked on the step portion .

In the embodiment in the positioning holding mechanism when the operation lever reaches the extrusion end position the operation lever moves while widening the taper portion of the guide slit . Accordingly when the protection cover is elastically deformed in accordance with an operation for widening the taper portion a problem arises in that the operation lever is pushed back by a reaction force of the protection cover caused by an elastic deformation.

At this time when the operation lever is pushed back from the extrusion end position a problem arises in that the positioning holding state of the positioning holding mechanism cannot be released.

In the example the operation lever is restricted at the extrusion end position by the position regulation mechanism .

In the restriction mechanism allows the operation lever to move from the initial position of the protection cover to the extrusion end position and allows the operation lever to be detached from the protection cover at the extrusion end position.

In the example until the operation lever is detached from the protection cover the process cartridge is restricted by the operation lever . When the operation lever is detached from the protection cover the restriction state of the process cartridge by the operation lever is released.

As a modified example of the example there is an example shown in . The restriction mechanism allows the operation lever to move from the initial position of the protection cover to the extrusion end position and then allows the operation lever to move to the upside within a state where the operation lever is not detached therefrom at the extrusion end position so that the restriction state of the process cartridge by the operation lever is released.

The restriction mechanism in the example is provided in the protection cover on the insertion side of the process cartridge to the apparatus housing body .

As shown in the restriction mechanism includes a torsion spring which is elastically deformable and which corresponds to an elastic restriction portion for maintaining a restriction position where the process cartridge in the protection cover comes into contact therewith to be restricted. The torsion spring is provided with a push portion to which a twisting force is applied about a rotation point . The push portion is hooked on a hook fixation concave portion formed in a part of the cartridge frame of the process cartridge and then the process cartridge is pushed into the protection cover so as not to be detached therefrom by the use of the push portion .

Meanwhile in the example as shown in the apparatus housing body includes a protrusion member serving as a restriction release member which is opposed to the torsion spring serving as an elastic restriction portion. The protrusion member is opposed to the push portion of the torsion spring at the time of the inserting operation of the process cartridge to the apparatus housing body and then allows the push portion to move from the restriction position to the restriction release position in the direction against the twisting force at the time coming into contact with the push portion .

Therefore according to the restriction mechanism in the example as shown in the push portion of the torsion spring surrounds and restricts the process cartridge in the protection cover before the process cartridge is inserted to the apparatus housing body .

Meanwhile when the process cartridge is inserted to the apparatus housing body and the protection cover needs to be positioned and held with respect to the apparatus housing body using the positioning holding mechanism the protrusion member comes into contact with the push portion of the torsion spring so as to release the restriction state of the process cartridge by the push portion . Accordingly when the extrusion operation of the operation lever is carried out the process cartridge is extruded from the protection cover and then is inserted and mounted to the apparatus housing body .

The restriction mechanism in the example includes an elastic restriction piece which is disposed in the protection cover on the insertion side of the process cartridge to the apparatus housing body . The elastic restriction piece includes an elastic piece which swings about one end of a part of the protection cover and a hook portion by which the process cartridge is restricted at the front end of the elastic piece .

Meanwhile the protrusion member serving as a restriction release member is disposed on the side of the apparatus housing body . The protrusion member moves the elastic piece from the restriction position to the restriction release position when the protrusion member is opposed to the hook portion of the elastic restriction piece and comes into contact with the hook portion .

Accordingly according to the restriction mechanism related to the example as shown in the hook portion of the elastic restriction piece surrounds and restricts the process cartridge in the protection cover before the process cartridge is inserted and mounted to the apparatus housing body .

Meanwhile when the process cartridge is inserted to the apparatus housing body and the protection cover needs to be positioned and held with respect to the apparatus housing body using the positioning holding mechanism the protrusion member comes into contact with the hook portion of the elastic restriction piece so as to release the restriction state of the process cartridge by the hook portion . Accordingly when the extrusion operation of the operation lever is carried out the process cartridge is extruded from the protection cover and then is inserted and mounted to the apparatus housing body .

Additionally as the restriction mechanism a plurality of examples may be appropriately selected. In the case where a plurality of restriction mechanisms are selected it is possible to increase restriction performance of the process cartridge in the protection cover .

In general since the type i.e. specification and shipping information of the process cartridge is different in accordance with the type of the image forming apparatus it is necessary to insert and mount the appropriate process cartridge to the image forming apparatus.

The embodiment provides a process cartridge identification structure which is necessary for appropriately mounting the process cartridge protected by the protection cover in accordance with the type of the image forming apparatus.

Hereinafter typical examples 1 and 2 of the process cartridge identification structure will be described.

In the example an identification component is disposed in the protection cover on the insertion side of the process cartridge to the apparatus housing body . The identification component may have an arbitrary shape and may be formed integrally with the protection cover or may be provided as an additional component so long as the relationship between the identification component and a mounting determination component which is described below and disposed in the apparatus housing body allows a non interference between the identification component and the mounting determination component so as to permit a positioning operation of the protection cover with respect to a regulation position or an interference between the identification component and the mounting determination component so as to prevent a positioning operation thereof with respect to the regulation position.

In this example as shown in the identification component is detachably mounted to for example a pair of component receive portions which are disposed in advance on both sides of the cover base of the protection cover .

At this time the identification component includes a component main body which is fitted to the component receive portion . In the component main body an identification protrusion which is determined in advance in accordance with the type of the process cartridge is disposed in a protruding manner on the side of the apparatus housing body .

In particular in the example the identification component is asymmetrically disposed on both sides of the protection cover and uniformly regulates the insertion direction of the process cartridge .

In this example an identification component for identifying the type of the process cartridge is disposed on the insertion side of the process cartridge to the apparatus housing body . The identification component for example is formed integrally with a part of the cartridge frame or is provided as an additional component.

As shown in the mounting determination component for determining whether the identification components and of the protection cover and the process cartridge are correct is disposed on the side of the apparatus housing body .

The mounting determination component is disposed on both sides of the cartridge receive portion of the apparatus housing body and determines whether three of identification components and that is a pair of identification components of the protection cover and the identification component of the process cartridge are appropriate.

Additionally the mounting determination component may be formed integrally with the apparatus housing body but in the example includes a component main body which can be mounted or detached to or from the apparatus housing body . At this time a pair of determination blocks and are formed integrally with the component main body .

When the process cartridge is appropriate and the protection cover is positioned and held to the apparatus housing body the determination blocks and of the mounting determination component are disposed so as not to interfere with the identification components and . On the other hand when the process cartridge is not appropriate and the protection cover is positioned and held to the apparatus housing body the determination blocks and of the mounting determination component are disposed so as to interfere with the identification components and .

Accordingly in the example when the process cartridge is inserted and mounted as shown in since the identification components and on the side of the protection cover and the process cartridge are disposed so as not to interfere with the determination blocks and of the mounting determination component on the side of the apparatus housing body at the time the protection cover is positioned and held to the apparatus housing body the protection cover is positioned and held to the apparatus housing body . In this state the process cartridge is inserted and mounted to the apparatus housing body .

As shown in the example uses the mounting determination component different from that of the typical example 1.

The mounting determination component includes a determination block with a substantially U shape on the side of the component main body facing the cartridge receive portion . A concave portion with a U shape of the determination block is used as a guide groove at the time of the inserting operation of the process cartridge .

As a mounting structure of the mounting determination component as shown in a positioning boss and a screw hole portion maybe formed in the rear surface of the component main body so as to be fixed to the apparatus housing body by the use of a screw. Alternatively as shown in a positioning boss and an elastic attachment piece which is elastically deformable may be formed in the rear surface of the component main body so as to hook the elastic attachment piece in an attachment hole not shown of the apparatus housing body to be thereby fixed thereto.

In the same drawing the mounting determination component includes a determination block in the lower region of the component main body . At this time a slope surface portion of the determination block facing the cartridge receive portion is used as a guide groove at the time of the inserting operation of the process cartridge .

As an attachment structure of the mounting determination component as shown in the positioning boss and the screw hole portion may be fixed in the rear surface of the component main body so as to be fixed to the apparatus housing body by the use of a screw. Alternatively as shown in the positioning boss and the elastic attachment piece which is elastically deformable may be formed in the rear surface of the component main body so as to hook the elastic attachment piece in an attachment hole not shown of the apparatus housing body to be thereby fixed thereto.

At this time when the appropriate process cartridge is inserted and mounted to the apparatus housing body shown in for example as shown in the identification component of the process cartridge does not interfere with the mounting determination component . Accordingly the process cartridge is inserted and mounted to the apparatus housing body .

At this time the concave portion with a U shape of the mounting determination component is used as a guide groove at the time of the inserting mounting operation of the process cartridge to the apparatus housing body .

Meanwhile when the inappropriate process cartridge is inserted and mounted to the apparatus housing body shown in for example as shown in the identification component of the process cartridge interferes with the mounting determination component . Accordingly the process cartridge is not inserted and mounted to the apparatus housing body by mistake.

When the appropriate process cartridge is inserted and mounted to the apparatus housing body shown in for example as shown in the identification component of the protection cover does not interfere with the mounting determination component . Accordingly the protection cover is positioned and held to the apparatus housing body and then the process cartridge is inserted and mounted to the apparatus housing body .

Meanwhile when the inappropriate process cartridge is inserted and mounted to the apparatus housing body shown in for example as shown in the identification component of the protection cover interferes with the mounting determination component . Accordingly the protection cover is not positioned and held to the apparatus housing body .

When the appropriate process cartridges are inserted and mounted to all cartridge receive portions of the apparatus housing body shown in the process cartridge may be sequentially inserted and mounted to each cartridge receive portion .
