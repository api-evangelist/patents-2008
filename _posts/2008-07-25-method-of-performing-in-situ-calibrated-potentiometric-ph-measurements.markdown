Solution pH is widely conceptualized as a master variable in the regulation of natural aqueous systems. It is a key feature in descriptive models of carbonate system chemistry trace metal speciation and bioavailability oxidation reduction equilibria and kinetics biologically induced carbon system transformations and the aqueous interactions and transformations of minerals. Rising levels of atmospheric COare leading to ocean acidification. The response of seawater and freshwaters to acidification processes has created a need for autonomous global monitoring of ocean water and fresh water pH. The importance of pH in investigations of terrestrial and oceanic biogeochemistry has necessitated improvements in not only the quality of measurements precision and accuracy but also the spatial and temporal resolution of measurements in the field. Potentiometric devices are rarely used for in situ environmental pH measurements because in situ buffer calibrations are problematic. Spectrophotometric devices have been developed for in situ environmental measurements but the endurance and measurement frequency of spectrophotometric devices is relatively low due to high power requirements and the limited longevity of lamps. Achieving meaningful spatial and temporal measurements in the field mandates the introduction of robust measurement devices capable of accurate and precise measurements over extended timeframes.

The present invention provides a device capable of precise and accurate potentiometric pH measurements in situ. Also provided are associated methods for in situ calibrated pH measurements. Embodiments of an in situ calibrated potentiometric device according to the invention couple potentiometric pH measurement systems to systems for calibrating the potentiometric pH measurement systems. The potentiometric system aspect of the device employs one or more glass pH sensitive electrodes connected to a potentiometer i.e. a device capable of measuring electrical potentials voltages . A key feature of the potentiometric system is that rather than being calibrated conventionally with buffers it can be calibrated with an in situ device that measures pH spectrophotometrically. Spectrophotometric pH measurements obtained via sulfonephthalein absorbance measurements are inherently calibrated and do not require the buffers necessary for the calibration of typical potentiometric devices. Thus devices according to the invention allow for continuous potentiometric pH measurements with occasional spectrophotometric calibrations.

The spectrophotometric calibration system aspect of the device utilizes a spectrophotometer with associated pumps for combining a sulfonephthalein pH indicator with the aqueous medium whose pH is to be measured.

Through contemporaneous potentiometric measurements the potentiometric pH system glass electrode plus volt meter is calibrated without the use of buffers. The device will record potentiometric pH measurements for an extended period of time until the spectrophotometric device is autonomously activated for another calibration. In this manner precise and accurate pH measurements can be obtained continuously in the environment and the low energy expenditure of the potentiometric device provides excellent endurance.

In a first aspect the present invention provides a device for in situ calibrated potentiometric pH measurement. The device includes a potentiometric pH measurement module a spectrophotometric pH measurement module and a calibration module.

In certain embodiments the received pH calibration data utilizes one or more substantially contemporaneous pH measurements from the potentiometric pH measurement module and the spectrophotometric pH measurement module. Thus a potentiometric pH measurement is performed at substantially simultaneously to a spectrophotometric pH measurement. By performing the operations coextensively fluctuations due to ambient conditions and sample identity are minimized.

In further embodiments of the device the spectrophotometric pH measurement module can include a first reservoir containing a sulfonephthalein pH indicator one or more pumps in communication with the first reservoir and an aqueous medium a second reservoir to receive combined aqueous medium pH indicator combined mixture and a spectrophotometer to measure the absorbance characteristics of the combined mixture.

The spectrophotometric pH measurement is considered accurate while any deviation between the potentiometric pH measurement and the spectrophotometric pH measurement is due to discrepencies in the potentiometric pH measurement due to factors such as the inherent drift observed in this type of unit over time. The adjusting step calibrates the potentiometric pH measurement device.

In certain embodiments the step of obtaining a potentiometric pH measurement of a second portion of the aqueous medium is performed substantially contemporaneously with the step of obtaining an absorbance spectrum from the combined medium.

Rising levels of atmospheric COare leading to ocean acidification. The response of seawater and freshwaters to acidification processes has created a need for autonomous global monitoring of ocean water and fresh water pH. Potentiometric devices are rarely used for in situ environmental pH measurements because in situ buffer calibrations are problematic. Spectrophotometric devices have been developed for in situ environmental measurements but the endurance and measurement frequency of spectrophotometric devices is relatively low due to high power requirements and the limited longevity of lamps. Spectrophotometric and potentiometric devices can be combined to reduce power enhance longevity and still provide high quality calibrated measurements.

Both potentiometric and spectrophotometric procedures can be used for pH measurements. Potentiometric pH measurements can be performed with relatively simple equipment and procedures required. This simplicity makes potentiometry a good choice for field measurements as long as there are not stringent requirements for accuracy and precision. Under ideal conditions potentiometric measurements that utilize glass hydrogen ion selective electrodes can provide measurement precisions on the order of 0.003 pH units. However measurement accuracy can be problematic. Potentiometric measurements generally require regular buffer calibrations and special care must be taken to address artifacts associated with both residual liquid junction potentials and variations in asymmetry potentials. Seiter and DeGrandpre evaluated performance of six electrodes under identical operational conditions. They observed that individual electrodes generally have distinctive drift patterns with drift rates up to 0.02 pH units per day Seiter J. C. DeGrandpre M. D. 2001 54 99 . Electrode drift necessitates frequent calibrations making autonomous operation somewhat problematic compared to spectrophotometric pH determinations. One important advantage of potentiometric devices is their low power consumption. This aspect would seem to make them well suited for deployment over extended periods of time. Unfortunately their use for such deployment is greatly limited by their inherent drift making readings increasingly inaccurate and necessitating calibration for meaningful use.

Although potentiometric pH measurements are versatile and satisfactory for many applications spectrophotometric pH measurement procedures have at least two important advantages that make them particularly desirable. Since spectrophotometric pH measurements can be determined via absorbance ratios and the calibration of pH indicators is a laboratory exercise that establishes how each indicator s molecular properties vary with temperature pressure and ionic strength spectrophotometric pH measurements are inherently calibrated and can be termed calibration free . Subsequent to careful laboratory calibration spectrophotometric pH measurements do not require the use of buffers. Secondly thousands of at sea observations have demonstrated that the imprecision of shipboard spectrophotometric pH measurements is on the order of 0.0003 to 0.0004 pH units approximately an order of magnitude better than potentiometric results. These advantageous attributes of spectrophotometric pH measurements have made spectrophotometric procedures valuable for not only observations of pH but also for measurements of COfugacity and total dissolved inorganic carbon. However the power consumption of spectrophotometers is considerably greater than potentiometers. This can be a limitation for their long term deployment. The limited longevity of lamps in spectrophotometers is an additional impediment to their long term deployment.

Spectrophotometric pH measurements have been increasingly utilized for measurements of pH in natural waters. Bellerby et al. developed a flow injection procedure for spectrophotometric measurement of seawater pH with a reported precision of 0.005 pH units and a sample frequency of 25 hr Bellerby R. G. J. Turner D. R. Millward G. E. Worsfold P. J. 1995 309 259. . Tapp et al. described the use of a shipboard system for spectrophotometric measurements of surface water pH with a reported precision on the order of 0.001 pH units and a 1 Hz measurement frequency Tapp M. Hunter K. Currie K. Mackaskill B. 2000 72 193. . Relative to discrete measurements however observed discrepancies were as large as 0.02 pH units. Martz et al. described the construction of a submersible pH sensor with a 0.003 unit measurement precision and a measurement frequency of 6 hr Martz T. R. Carr J. J. French C. R. DeGrandpre M. D. Anal. Chem. 2003 75 1844. .

Submersible potentiometric sensors according to the present invention provide continuous unattended measurements of seawater pH for periods of six to twelve months with a measurement frequency up to 60 Hz. No calibrations are required on the part of the user. Both measurements and calibrations are performed in situ. Measurement accuracy is on the order of 0.001 pH units. High measurement frequency excellent endurance characteristics and in situ calibration make this sensor system well suited to descriptions of acid base equilibrium and kinetic phenomena on diurnal seasonal and annual scales.

The present invention provides a device capable of precise and accurate potentiometric pH measurements in situ. Embodiments of a potentiometric device according to the invention consist of one or more glass pH sensitive electrodes connected to a potentiometer e.g. a device capable of measuring electrical potentials voltages . A key feature of the device is that rather than being calibrated conventionally with buffers it can be calibrated with an in situ device that measures pH spectrophotometrically. Spectrophotometric pH measurements obtained via sulfonephthalein absorbance measurements are inherently calibrated do not require buffers . Thus devices according to the invention allow for continuous potentiometric pH measurements with occasional spectrophotometric calibrations. The spectrophotometric calibration device consists of a spectrophotometer with associated pumps for combining a sulfonephthalein pH indicator with the aqueous medium whose pH is to be measured. After a sulfonephthalein indicator and the aqueous medium e.g. seawater are combined in an optical cell light is passed through the combined mixture an absorbance spectrum is obtained and solution pH is calculated from a optical absorbance ratios at multiple wavelengths b temperature and c the salt concentration e.g. salinity of the solution.

The device will record potentiometric pH measurements for an extended period of time until the spectrophotometric device is autonomously activated for another calibration. In this manner precise and accurate pH measurements can be obtained continuously in the environment and the low energy expenditure of the potentiometric device provides excellent endurance.

It is contemplated that calibrations can be triggered by a variety of events or circumstances. For example calibrations can be triggered based upon time intervals or other user defined events. Alternatively or in conjunction with such tachniques calibrations can be triggered based upon observations of potentiometric pH changes. For example a sudden pH cahnge outside of the typical deviations of pH recordings could trigger a calibration to ensure that the large recorded deviaiton was real.

A number of other solutions are available to avoid problems associated with potiometric drift in the long term deployment of these devices. Pontiometric pH measurement devices consist of a a glass pH sensitive membrane and b a reference electrode. One of the main sources problems in a potentiometric pH measurement is clogging of what is called the liquid junction of the reference cell. This is an event that could initiate drift. If the potentiometric system is initially calibrated some slow drift may be acceptable because subsequent deviations between spectrophotometric and potentiometric measurements might be small. If deviations suddenly become large the device could be told to select a different reference electrode or a different glass electrode . Alternatively or in conjunctions with the above procedures the system could be directed to flush itself with a microbial inhibitor or to activate an ultrasonic device for cleaning.

Procedures for direct measurements of carbonate ion concentrations and saturation states in seawater have also been developed. Measurements are obtained via ultraviolet spectroscopic observations of Pb II spectra as the relative concentrations of PbCOand an ensemble of lead chloride complexes vary in response to dissolved CO. Measurement precision is enhanced by parameterization in terms of absorbance ratios. The PbCOstability constant and Pb II molar absorbance ratios in seawater were determined at 25 C. over a range of salinity between 36 and 20. The procedures described herein are well suited to measurements throughout the normal range of carbonate ion concentrations in the oceans. Rapid equilibration rates for Pb II carbonate complexation make the procedures described in this work well suited to rapid direct analysis in situ.

The health of coral reefs and calcareous plankton is also strongly influenced by the carbonate saturation state of seawater. Calculations of carbonate saturation states currently require measurements of two COsystem parameters such as pH and total dissolved carbon plus thermodynamic calculations that relate carbonate ion concentrations to directly measured parameters.

Investigations of the marine COsystem are commonly conducted through measurements of four primary variables total dissolved inorganic carbon C total solution alkalinity A COfugacity CO and solution pH. Thermodynamic models link these four primary variables whereby measurements of any two variables can be used to calculate the two remaining parameters DOE 1994 . These models also allow calculations of the concentrations of the individual forms of inorganic carbon in seawater the dissolved concentrations of COand HCO and the free plus ion paired concentrations of bicarbonate HCO and carbonate CO. Two of the directly measured and derived COsystem variables can be highlighted because of their special significance in evaluations of global carbon fluxes and the biogeochemistry of marine carbonates in general. COfugacity measurements are essential to descriptions of COexchange at the air sea interface DOE 1994 McGillis and Wanninkhof 2006 Millero 2007 and carbonate ion concentrations are essential to evaluations of a the mineralization rates of marine calcifiers Langdon and Atkinson 2005 and b the dissolution rates of calcite and aragonite CaCOpolymorphs both on the seafloor and in the water column Morse 1978 Keir 1980 Acker et al. 1987 .

Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations over the past two centuries have led to increasing COuptake by the oceans Royal Society 2005 . This process which is decreasing the pH of the upper ocean is reducing oceanic carbonate ion concentrations and thus the level of saturation of calcium carbonate Broecker et al 1979 Feely et al. 2004 On et al. 2005 . If the trend continues it will have a seriously negative impact on key marine organisms such as corals and some plankton Kleypas et al 2006 . In view of the importance of carbonate ion concentrations CO to the oceans rapidly evolving carbonate system it is then highly desirable to move CO from the rank of derived COsystem variables to the list of primary measured variables.

A variety of metals in seawater including lead Byrne 1981 copper Byrne and Miller 1985 the lanthanides Cantrell and Byrne 1987 and various actinides Byrne 2002 have inorganic speciation schemes that are strongly dominated by carbonate complexation. Among these metals the speciation of Pb II and Cu II has been examined directly by ultraviolet absorbance spectroscopy in natural seawater Byrne 1981 Byrne and Miller 1985 . Since the ultraviolet absorbance characteristics of these metals are strongly influenced by dissolved carbonate it follows that observations of Pb II and Cu II absorbance spectra can be used to directly determine seawater carbonate ion concentrations. As a means of achieving high precisions in such determinations we have developed procedures that involve measurements of absorbance ratios rather than absolute absorbance. Our techniques are closely analogous to those that were developed previously for seawater pH measurements with precisions on the order of 0.0004 pH units Robert Baldo et al 1985 Byrne 1987 Byrne and Breland 1989 Clayton and Byrne 1993 . Whereas spectrophotometric observations of sulfonephthalein acid base equilibria are utilized for seawater pH measurements spectrophotometric observations of metal ion complexation can be used to quantify anion concentrations in seawater. Lead is especially well suited to such measurements because a PbCOand a variety of Pb II chloride complexes have dissimilar absorbance spectra in the ultraviolet and b species other than PbCOand chloride complexes appear to be insignificant over a wide range of salinities in natural seawater. In this work Pb II formation constants and molar absorbance ratios required for direct determinations of carbonate ion concentrations in seawater are characterized at 25 C. as a function of salinity. In addition to development of procedures for measurement of carbonate ions and carbonate saturation state we also show that measurements of Pb II absorbance ratios in acidified seawater can be used to determine seawater salinity with a precision on the order of 0.1 salinity units. The procedures described in this work are suitable for rapid autonomous in situ monitoring of carbonate ion concentration in seawater.

The PbCOformation reaction in seawater Pb COPbCO 1 can be quantitatively described with an equilibrium constant of the following form 

Use of Eq. 3 at wavelengths and allows carbonate ion concentrations CO to be directly calculated from observations of absorbance ratios 

The form of Eq. 5 is identical to that which has been used for highly precise measurements of seawater pH from observations of sulfonephthalein absorbance in seawater Robert Baldo et al 1985 Byrne 1987 Byrne and Breland 1989 Clayton and Byrne 1993 .

At sufficiently low pH i.e. where CO 0 Eq. 4 can be written as 7 It has been shown Byrne et al. 1981 that characterizations of the molar absorptivities of individual species of Pb II can be used to directly determine the relative concentrations of Pb PbCl PbCland PbCl in both synthetic solutions and seawater. Since the relative concentrations of these species are directly dependent on the chloride concentrations in synthetic solutions and seawater it follows that Pb II absorbance ratios at low pH are directly dependent on salinity. In addition to developing a direct means of determining carbonate ion concentrations via Eq. 5 we show in this work that observations of Pb II absorbance ratios at low pH allow calculations of seawater salinity with a precision somewhat better than 0.2 . Methods

Eq. 5 can be used to determine carbonate ion concentrations via direct measurements of Pb II absorbance ratios and characterizations of e e and e. Observations of Pb II absorbance spectra at salinities typical of open ocean seawater S 35.87 reveal isosbestic points near 234 nm . On this basis one of the two wavelengths chosen for absorbance observations was 234 nm Although use of shorter wavelengths is desirable as a means of increasing sensitivity to formation of PbCO small absorbance contributions from carbonate ions at shorter wavelengths make interpretations of absorbances at 

Characterizations of log in this work were obtained using Eq. 3 and measurements of A and CO in seawater samples at constant salinity and constant temperature. Along with characterizations of log these measurements also produced paired characterizations of and . Paired characterizations of and were obtained from measurements of A and CO using Eq. 3 and the log values determined at each salinity as described above. Paired characterizations of and were obtained from A observations at low pH . The molar absorbance ratios e eand ein Eq. 5 were then determined from these paired molar absorbance characterizations as follows 8 9 10 

All chemicals used were analytical reagent grade. PbCand NaHCOwere from Sigma Aldrich. HCl 1.000 M was from J. T. Baker. The seawater used in this study was surface water from the Gulf of Mexico. Seawater salinity was measured with an SBE 49 CTD Seabird . Seawater samples at various salinities were prepared by dilution with Milli Q water. Absorbance measurements were obtained using quartz optical cells 10 cm pathlength in an HP 8453 spectrophotometer. The slitwidth of this spectrophotometer is 1 nm. Use of a spectrophotometer with a substantially larger slitwidth can alter the wavelength dependent absorbance characteristics of the parameters given in equations 8 10 . The temperature of the samples in the optical cells was controlled 25 0.05 C. with a Neslab refrigerating circulator and a water jacketed spectrophotometric cell holder.

Seawater alkalinity was determined using a spectrophotometric procedure Yao and Byrne 1998 that is precise to better than 1 mmol kg. Seawater 140.0 g was added gravimetrically to an open top optical cell 10 cm pathlength which in turn was positioned in the thermostated cell holder. Sample pH was measured using an Orion Ross type pH electrode No. 800500 connected to an Orion pH meter Model 720A in the absolute millivolt mode. Nerstian behavior of the pH electrode was confirmed via titrations of 0.7 molal NaCl solutions with concentrated HCl. The electrode was calibrated on the total hydrogen ion concentration scale through measurements in natural seawater whose pH was determined by simultaneous spectrophotometric observations of thymol blue absorbance ratios Zhang and Byrne 1996 .

Through addition of NaHCO the alkalinity of each seawater sample was increased to values approximately double those of natural seawater final alkalinity 4.0 millimolal . Seawater samples had COfugacities generally in excess of 500 atm and pH 8.0. After each seawater sample was thermally equilibrated a reference spectrum was taken and 1.05 ml of a 0.001 mol kg PbClstock solution was added to the sample final Pb II 7.5 mol kg . An absorbance spectrum was then taken along with a potentiometric measurement of pH. The sample was subsequently titrated with standard HCl using a Gilmont micrometer syringe. HCl additions were quantified gravimetrically. Pb II absorbance alkalinity and pH were recorded for each titration point. Sample alkalinity was calculated by accounting for cumulative HCl additions to the initial seawater sample. Calculations of CO from alkalinity and pH utilized the total H scale dissociation constants of Dickson and Millero 1987 that were derived from the data of Mehrbach et al. 1973 . All such calculations were performed using the COsystem program of Pierrot et al. 2006 . Based on 95 confidence intervals for total alkalinities on the order of 0.1 and 95 confidence intervals for open cell pH measurements on the order of 0.01 units corresponding relative errors in calculated carbonate ion concentrations are approximately 2.3 e.g. 5.8 mol kg when CO 250 mol kg . Non linear least squares parameter estimates of and were obtained using Eq. 3 and paired values of A and CO . Calculations of CO that accounted for minor contributions of PbCOto carbonate alkalinity did not cause significant changes in derived values of and . Absorbance contributions of CO at short wavelengths were examined by performing titration experiments without addition of Pb II to samples. Observations of well defined isosbestic points near 234 nm demonstrate that these corrections are very small at the wavelengths utilized in this work. The dependencies of e eand eon salinity were described via quadratic functions.

Pb II absorbance measurements in acidified seawater pH 3.7 Pb II 7.5 mol kg were used to determine values at 234 and 250 nm. Absorbances in this case were measured against a reference solution of acidified seawater that contained no lead. The absorbance ratios obtained in these experiments were used in determinations of eand e as described above and were also used in a least squares quadratic regression that allows salinity S to be calculated from A A observations at low pH.

Estimates for and obtained using Eq. 3 are given in Table 1 and are shown graphically in . Over a salinity range between S 20 and S 36 the dependence of the PbCOformation constant on S at 25 C. can be described as log 6.574 0.12351.514 10 11 with a 0.023 standard error of estimation. The and values determined in this analysis exhibited a linear dependence on salinity 8.443 10 7.258 10 12 4.563 10 2.252 10 13 

The and values determined using the log results in Table 1 and absorbance observations at 234 nm are given in Table 2. The graphical depiction of these results shows that the dependence of on salinity is linear while satisfactory descriptions of Erequire a quadratic term 3.837 10 1.749 10 14 3.055 10 2.028 102.548 10 15 

The salinity dependence for observations of in acidified seawater Table 3 and is well described by the following expression 0.1931 2.062 103.852 10 16 

Using the results that are summarized in Eqs. 12 through 16 Eqs. 8 through 10 can be used to calculate e eand eat each salinity. The coefficients obtained in this manner are given in Table 4 and are depicted graphically in FIGS. and .

The salinity dependencies of e eand eare then given as follows 0.3447 6.662 101.463 10 17 0.7749 1.122 103.331 10 18 2.114 6.600 109.036 10 19 

Eq. 5 Eq. 11 and Eqs. 17 through 19 permit direct measurements of CO from measurements of Pb II absorbance ratios in seawater at 25 C. Eq. 5 can however also be written in an alternative form with a smaller number of parameters log CO log e log R e 1 Re e 20 

This equation is advantageous for calculations of carbonate ion concentrations because a it reduces the number of parameterizations required for measurements Using Eq. 20 e is determined as a single parameter and e e is determined as a single parameter b the parameter e e can be precisely determined from direct measurements at low pH It is directly determined from the absorbance ratios shown in e e A A c using e e values determined at low pH Eq. 20 can be used with paired CO and R observations to directly determine e and e. The results of such analyses using each of the data sets that were employed to develop Eq. 11 and Eqs. 17 through 19 are given in Table 5 and are depicted graphically in and . shows the residuals CO CO hd TT for each least squares analysis using Eq. 20 . It should be noted that the residuals shown in are derived from three independent sources. One of these is the absorbance ratios that are used to predict CO via Eq. 20 and the others are the alkalinity and pH measurements that are used to derive observed values of CO . Of these three types of measurements there is reason to suspect that potentiometric pH measurements may constitute the greatest source of scatter seen in . Since field measurements of CO based on absorbance ratios are independent of alkalinity and pH the precision of CO measurements obtained via absorbance spectroscopy should be considerably better than that which is depicted in . The results shown in suggest that Eq. 20 can be used to satisfactorily predict CO over a wide range of conditions in seawater. Preliminary assessment of the relative contributions of potentiometric and spectrophotometric contributions to the residuals in suggest that the relative standard deviation for Eq. 20 calculations of CO is on the order of 2 or less. The best least squares descriptions for the salinity dependencies of the parameters in Eq. 20 for 20 S 36 are given as follows log 6.087 8.495 109.360 10 21 0.2215 5.554 108.440 10 22 3.061 8.730 109.363 10 23 

It should be emphasized that the equation 22 and 23 characterizations of eand e ewere obtained through fits involving equation 20 and did not involve the e eand echaracterizations given in equations 17 through 19 .

Using equations 20 through 23 carbonate ion concentrations can be measured via procedures that closely follow those employed by Clayton and Byrne 1993 for measurements of seawater pH 

It should be noted that the relatively high lead concentrations used for measurements of carbonate ion concentrations preclude significant complexation by dissolved and particulate organics in seawater. Since ionic Pb II in seawater is not significantly volatile the principal safety concern surrounding the manipulation of solutions enriched in lead is avoidance of inadvertent ingestion. This should especially be borne in mind with respect to handling of the 1 mM stock Pb titrant solution and safe disposal of waste solutions.

Salinity measurements required for calculations of log e e and e e are commonly available from either shipboard or in situ conductimetric observations. When such is not the case however salinity can be calculated from absorbance ratios using the following relationship that is based on the data shown in for acidified seawater 8.76 45.156.092 24 

where R A A and 20 S 36. The standard deviation for Eq. 24 estimates of salinity is 0.06 salinity units. Thus Eq. 24 provides seawater salinity estimates that are precise to approximately 0.2 over the normal salinity range of seawater.

Thus salinity can be measured from absorbance ratio observations after Pb II is added to an acidic seawater solution. Other metals can be used to obtain sensitive salinity measurements over various ranges of salinity. The work reported herein was performed at 25 C. It follows that the salinity measurements could be performed at other temperatures after suitable laboratory calibrations. This would allow salinity measurements and or carbonate measurements to be obtained without thermostatting. Such calibrations facilitate carbonate measurements in situ over a range of temperatures.

The potentiometer measures the millivolts developed by a pH electrode vs a reference electrode. The solution measured consists of the aqueous medium plus a small amount of indicator. The pH of this mixture is assessed by both the spectrophotometer and the potentiometer. The potentiometric pH is determined by an equation of the following form pH millivolts 25 

The b term in the above equation Eq. 25 is an electrode slope that depends on temperature. The a term depends on a number of variables and can be determined via calibrations. In the present instance the potentiometric system or the calibration system is told the pH of a given solution i.e. the pH value is determined spectrophotometrically whereupon the constant a is determined from the above equation. In such a system it is also possible to have an additional pump so that aqueous solution indicator and acid are combined. In this case pH is again measured spectrotometrically and the above equation can be used to solve for both slope b and intercept a .

In the absence of direct spectrophotometric determinations of CO as described above CO must be calculated from measurements of either total dissolved inorganic carbon or total alkalinity combined with either pH or COfugacity. While spectrophotometric pH measurements are rapid with acquisition rates on the order of seconds measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon total alkalinity and COfugacity generally require several minutes as a lower bound . Thus the spectrophotometric procedures for measurements of carbonate ion concentrations described in this work and those for spectrophotometric pH analysis Liu et al. 2006 are unique in their suitability for prompt in situ analysis. Although in situ analysis will require evaluations of the influence of temperature on the various parameters in Eq. 20 the work of Soli et al. 2008 showed that the influence of temperature on log is quite small. Since the influence of temperature on molar absorptivity ratios should be relatively minor it is likely that Eq. 20 can easily be extended to include analysis at in situ conditions. With respect to both in situ and laboratory analysis spectrophotometric pH and CO measurement procedures can be distinguished from those required for Cwith respect to both procedural and instrumental simplicity. In contrast to the equipment required for state of the art Canalyses spectrophotometers are standard equipment in a wide variety of research and teaching laboratories.

As has been the case for spectrophotometric measurements of pH it should be anticipated that the parameters required for quantitative CO measurements e.g. Eqs. 21 through 24 will periodically be reevaluated and refined. This process will include in particular comparisons obtained through ship based oceanic carbon system expeditions wherein the thermodynamic consistency of all measurable COsystem parameters is commonly evaluated Clayton et al. 1995 Lee et al. 2000 . It should be emphasized in this case that any future revisions in characterizations of log e eand e e will allow refinements with improved accuracy of archived CO data. As long as data are recorded as R S pairs i.e. absorbance ratios and salinity all calculations of CO are amenable to quantitative reassessment. As such observations of Pb II absorbance ratios provide a molecularly based index of carbonate ion concentrations in seawater.

The procedures described in this work are suitable for rapid quantitative assessments of calcite and aragonite saturation states in seawater. Since the solubility products of calcite and aragonite in S 35 seawater are approximately 10and 10 Millero 2007 and the total calcium concentration is 0.0103 mol kg at salinity the carbonate ion concentrations for saturation with calcite and aragonite are 41.7 mol kg and 63.3 mol kg. The log results given by Eq. 11 log 4.106 at S 35 show that inorganic Pb II is partitioned equally between PbCOand lead chloride complexes when CO 78.3 mmol kg. Thus the procedures described in this work are well suited to measurement of CaCOsaturation states both below and well above the saturation levels of calcite and aragonite.
