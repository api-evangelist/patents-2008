This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60 995 525 filed Sep. 27 2007.

The instant invention relates to novel salt forms and crystalline forms thereof of S 4 4 fluorophenyl 7 5 1 hydroxy 1 trifluoromethyl propyl 1 3 4 oxadiazol 2 ylamino methyl 2H chromen 2 one and its use as a leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitor alone or in combination with other active agents to treat conditions such as asthma allergic rhinitis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and atherosclerosis.

Inhibition of leukotriene biosynthesis has been an active area of pharmaceutical research for many years. The leukotrienes constitute a group of locally acting hormones produced in living systems from arachidonic acid. Leukotrienes are potent contractile and inflammatory mediators derived by enzymatic oxygenation of arachidonic acid by 5 lipoxygenase. One class of leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors are those known to act through inhibition of 5 lipoxygenase 5 LO .

The major leukotrienes are Leukotriene B abbreviated as LTB LTC LTDand LTE. The biosynthesis of these leukotrienes begins with the action of the enzyme 5 lipoxygenases on arachidonic acid to produce the epoxide known as Leukotriene A LTA which is converted to the other leukotrienes by subsequent enzymatic steps. Further details of the biosynthesis as well as the metabolism of the leukotrienes are to be found in the book Leukotrienes and Lipoxygenases ed. J. Rokach Elsevier Amsterdam 1989 . The actions of the leukotrienes in living systems and their contribution to various diseases states are also discussed in the book by Rokach.

In general 5 LO inhibitors have been sought for the treatment of allergic rhinitis asthma and inflammatory conditions including arthritis. One example of a 5 LO inhibitor is the marketed drug zileuton ZYLOFT which is indicated for the treatment of asthma. More recently it has been reported that 5 LO may be an important contributor to the atherogenic process see Mehrabian M. et al. Circulation Research Jul. 26 2002 91 2 120 126.

The instant invention also provides methods for preventing or reducing the risk for having an atherosclerotic disease event comprising administering a prophylactically effective amount of a salt of this invention to a patient who is at risk of developing atherosclerosis or having an atherosclerotic disease event.

The instant invention further provides the use of a salt of this invention in combination with other therapeutically effective agents. Additional embodiments will be evident from the following detailed description.

Compound I is a pharmacologically active free base compound. The salts of the present invention can be prepared by combining free base Compound I with either benzene sulfonic or p toluenesulfonic acid to provide the besylate and tosylate salts respectively. Compound I tosylate salt is preferred. For the purpose of clarity the following salt names can be used interchangeably and have the same meaning the p toluenesulfonic acid salt of Compound I can also be referred to as the p toluenesulfonate 4 methylphenylsulfonate or tosylate salt of Compound I and the benzenesulfonic acid salt of Compound I can also be referred to as the benzenesulfonate or besylate salt of Compound I.

The salts of Compound I may be prepared by placing Compound I free base in contact with the appropriate acid in an organic solvent such as 1 2 dichloroethane isopropyl acetate iPAc ethyl acetate tetrahydrofuran heptane methylcyclohexane acetonitrile acetone as well as nitromethane cyclohexane i propyl alcohol and methyl isobutyl ketone heating if needed up to reflux to obtain a solution followed by cooling to induce precipitation. The salt in solid form may precipitate from a single solvent or precipitation may be initiated by addition of an anti solvent and can be collected by filtration.

The tosylate salt of Compound I readily forms solvates with organic solvents for example but not limited to iPAc heptane methylcyclohexane tetrahydrofuran acetonitrile and acetone as well as nitromethane cyclohexane i propyl alcohol and methyl isobutyl ketone MIBK . Such solvates can be formed by combining anhydrous crystalline form of the tosylate salt of Compound I hereinafter referred to as Form A with an organic solvent and stirring to form a slurry. Conversion from an anhydrous form to a solvated form can occur over varying timeframes for example from a few hours to several days and can be monitored by known analytical techniques such as XRPD. Analysis to detect the formation of a solvate can be performed on a sample of the slurry or the slurry can be filtered and the analysis performed on the resulting wet cake. If the analysis is performed on the wet cake it must be done in sufficient time prior to evaporation desolvation of the solvent from the crystalline compound.

Solvated Compound I tosylate salt readily desolvates to the anhydrous Form A. Desolvation can be accomplished by standard methods known in the art for example by allowing the solvated compound to sit in an open container at ambient temperature i.e. about 25 C. until the solvent evaporates or by accelerating evaporation of the solvent using elevated temperatures and or vacuum.

Crystalline solvates of Compound I tosylate salt as described herein are those solvated crystal forms which when desolvated result in anhydrous crystalline Form A. Since such crystalline solvates are the solvated counterparts to crystalline anhydrous Form A the solvated crystal forms may share certain physical characteristic data with Form A where the data is derived from solid state analysis. For example crystalline solvates of Compound I tosylate salt and anhydrous Form A may share one or more of the same or reasonably similar d spacings in their XRPD or the same or reasonably similar chemical shifts in the solid state carbon 13 CPMAS NMR spectra. Accordingly such solvates are within the scope of this invention.

The amorphous tosylate salt of Compound I can be generated by milling spray drying or melt quenching of the crystalline tosylate salt. The amorphous tosylate salt can be re crystallized to crystalline tosylate salt in an organic solvent such as 1 2 dichloroethane isopropyl acetate ethyl acetate tetrahydrofuran heptane methylcyclohexane acetonitrile acetone as well as nitromethane cyclohexane i propyl alcohol and methyl isobutyl ketone heating if needed up to reflux to obtain a solution followed by cooling to induce precipitation. Re crystallization can be accelerated at elevated relative humidity and or elevated temperature. For example heating the amorphous material to greater than 100 C. and holding it isothermal till re crystallization completion is detected by analytical techniques such as MDSC or XRPD.

The patient may be in need of treatment for an existing disease or medical condition or may desire prophylactic treatment to prevent or reduce the risk for diseases and medical conditions affected by inhibition of leukotriene biosynthesis.

The term therapeutically effective amount is intended to mean that amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue a system animal or human that is being sought by a researcher veterinarian medical doctor or other clinician. The term prophylactically effective amount is intended to mean that amount of a pharmaceutical drug that will prevent or reduce the risk of occurrence of the biological or medical event that is sought to be prevented in a tissue a system animal or human by a researcher veterinarian medical doctor or other clinician.

Dosage amounts described herein are based on the weight of the pharmaceutically active free base Compound I. The magnitude of prophylactic or therapeutic dose of a compound of this invention will of course vary with the nature of the severity of the condition to be treated and its route of administration. It will also vary according to the age weight and response of the individual patient. It is understood that a specific daily dosage amount can simultaneously be both a therapeutically effective amount e.g. for treatment to slow progression of existing atherosclerosis and a prophylactically effective amount e.g. for prevention of an atherosclerotic disease event or formation of new lesions. In general the daily dose range for anti asthmatic anti inflammatory including COPD treatment anti allergic including allergic rhinitis or anti atherosclerotic use and generally uses other than cytoprotection can lie within the range of from about 0.01 mg to about 3 mg per kg body weight of a mammal particularly a human preferably 0.1 mg to about 2.5 mg per kg in single or divided doses and preferably in a single daily dose. On the other hand it may be necessary to use dosages outside these limits in some cases.

In the case where an oral composition is employed a suitable daily dosage range for human anti asthmatic anti inflammatory anti allergic or anti atherosclerotic use is e.g. from about 1 mg to about 200 mg and more particularly from about 10 mg to about 150 mg preferably in a single daily dose. For example for anti asthmatic use a daily dosage amount can range from about 10 mg to about 100 mg for example 10 mg 50 mg or 100 mg may be employed. For COPD treatment a daily dosage amount could be for example 100 mg and for atherosclerosis treatment a daily dosage amount could be for example 150 mg. However suitable daily dosage amounts are not limited to these examples. Tablets and capsules such as dry filled capsules are preferred oral formulations for use in adult patients. Chewable or oral disintegrating formulations may also be used particularly for formulation intended for the pediatric population.

For inhaled formulations the dosage amount per administration is generally lower than that for an oral formulation such as a tablet or capsule. For example a daily dose of the active compound administered via an inhaled formulation may range from 0.010 mg to 10 mg and particularly from 0.010 mg to 2.5 mg. Single or multiple inhaled doses may be used per day but a single inhaled dose is preferred.

The active compound may be used for the prevention and or treatment in children of asthma as well as allergic rhinitis. For pediatric use the daily dosage range is expected to be lower than that for adult use. For example a suitable pediatric daily dosage amount may range from 1 mg to 200 mg per day and particularly from 1 mg to 50 mg per day. Dosage amounts contained in oral formulations and inhaled formulations for pediatric use would need to be adjusted accordingly. A single daily dose is preferred although divided doses can be used. Preferred pediatric oral formulations include an oral granule formulation e.g. a sprinkle chewable tablets and oral disintegrating solid formulations such as a disintegrating tablet. Drinkable syrups may also be employed. Taste masking technology may be employed with these or any other formulations described herein as needed.

For use where a composition for intravenous administration is employed a suitable daily dosage range for anti asthmatic anti inflammatory anti atherosclerotic or anti allergic use is from about 0.001 mg to about 25 mg preferably from 0.01 mg to about 1 mg of a compound of this invention per kg of body weight per day and for cytoprotective use from about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg preferably from about 1 mg to about 100 mg and more preferably from about 1 mg to about 10 mg of a compound of this invention per kg of body weight per day. For the treatment of diseases of the eye ophthalmic preparations for ocular administration comprising 0.001 1 by weight solutions or suspensions of the compounds of this invention in an acceptable ophthalmic formulation may be used.

For cytoprotective use a suitable daily dosage range is from 0.1 mg to about 100 mg preferably from about 1 mg to about 100 mg and more preferably from about 10 mg to about 100 mg of a compound of this invention per kg of body weight per day. The exact amount of a compound of this invention to be used as a cytoprotective agent will depend on inter alia whether it is being administered to heal damaged cells or to avoid future damage on the nature of the damaged cells e.g. gastrointestinal ulcerations vs. nephrotic necrosis and on the nature of the causative agent. An example of the use of a compound of this invention in avoiding future damage would be co administration of a compound of this invention with an NSAID that might otherwise cause such damage for example indomethacin . For such use the compound of this invention is administered from 30 minutes prior up to 30 minutes after administration of the NSAID. Preferably it is administered prior to or simultaneously with the NSAID for example in a combination dosage form . An oral formulation is preferred.

The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a salt of Compound I of this invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The salt of Compound I in the pharmaceutical compositions may be in the amorphous form or may be a crystalline form such as a crystalline form characterized hereinabove. Any suitable route of administration may be employed for providing a mammal especially a human with an effective dosage of a compound of the present invention. For example oral rectal topical parenteral including subcutaneous intramuscular and intravenous ocular ophthalmic pulmonary nasal or buccal inhalation and the like may be employed although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the condition being treated. They may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Dosage forms include for example tablets troches dispersions suspensions solutions capsules including dry filled capsules creams ointments aerosols and the like. Oral formulations are preferred for uses related to asthma COPD allergic rhinitis atherosclerosis and prevention of atherosclerotic disease events. Additionally inhaled formulations are desirable for treatment of asthma COPD and allergic rhinitis. Other formulations may be used consistent with the nature of the condition being treated.

Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient as a powder or granules or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid a non aqueous liquid an oil in water emulsion or a water in oil liquid emulsion. Such compositions may be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy but all methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then if necessary shaping the product into the desired presentation. For example a tablet may be prepared by compression or molding optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free flowing form such as powder or granules optionally mixed with a binder lubricant inert diluent surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. Desirably each solid dosage form e.g. tablet or capsule contains from about 1 mg to about 200 mg of the active ingredient on a free base weight basis for example but not limited to 1 mg 5 mg 10 mg 20 mg 25 mg 30 mg 40 mg 50 mg 60 mg 70 mg 75 mg 80 mg 90 mg 100 mg 125 mg 150 mg 175 mg and 200 mg.

For administration by inhalation the salts of Compound I of the present invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol suitable for pulmonary drug delivery. These aerosol dosage forms include but are not limited to nebulized solutions and suspensions metered dose inhalers or dry powder inhalers. For nebulization the active ingredient s are typically formulated in an aqueous vehicle and administered by jet or electronic devices capable of generating a fine aerosol cloud. Metered dose inhalers MDI use propellants such as hydrofluorocarbons to solubilize or suspend the active ingredient in a pressurized container capable of generating the disperse aerosol. For dry powder inhalation the salts of Compound I are used alone or with excipients in conjunction with a delivery device capable for delivery of the active substance to the lung.

Suitable topical formulations of a compound of this invention include transdermal devices aerosols creams ointments lotions dusting powders and the like.

In practical use the salts of Compound I of this invention can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration e.g. oral or parenteral including intravenous . In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed such as for example water glycols oils alcohols flavoring agents preservatives coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as for example suspensions elixirs and solutions or carriers such as starches sugars microcrystalline cellulose diluents granulating agents lubricants binders disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as for example powders capsules and tablets with the solid oral preparations being preferred over the liquid preparations. Because of their ease of administration tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If desired tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques.

In addition to the common dosage forms set out above the salts of Compound I of this invention may also be administered by controlled release means and or delivery devices such as those described in U.S. Pat.

Step A A process for making Compound I is described in Example 7 of WO2006 099735. A 50 mg ml Compound I stock solution was prepared by dissolving 1250 mg of Compound I free base in 25 ml of methanol. 200 uL of the Compound I stock solution was dispensed to each well in a 96 well plate resulting in 10 mg 0.02158 mmol of Compound I per well. Next a different acid was dispensed to each of columns 1 5 7 9 and 11 on the masterplate. To form the salts The acids were manually transferred as 0.1M acid stock solutions to each well in columns as indicated below with the exception of HBr HCl and acetic acid in columns 6 10 and 12 respectively which were added after the GeneVac step described below . 216 uL of the 0.1M acid stock solution was added per well on the 96 well masterplate resulting in a 1 1 mole ratio of acid to Compound I. Next the 96 well plate was placed in the GeneVac centrifugal evaporator to evaporate the solvents. HCl HBr and acetic acid were added to columns 10 6 and 12 respectively as 1M solutions 1M HCl in diethyl ether 1M HBr in MeOH and 1M acetic acid in MeOH respectively after the GeneVac step to prevent the acids from being removed in the centrifugal evaporator. The plate was evaporated for 2.5 hours at 1800 rpm 35 C. under 2 6 mbar vacuum until dry. The 96 well plate was mapped by columns acids and rows solvents see Step B below . The acid and solvent mapping of the 96 well plate was as follows 

Step B Addition of crystallization solvents The crystallization solvents described above for Rows A H were dispensed 800 uL well to the masterplate from Step A. The 96 well plate was capped and placed on the deck of a Cavro robot to equilibrate for 3 hours while stirring at 30 C. While warm the master plate was manually sampled into two crystallization plates Cooling 285 uL and Evaporation 300 uL . The cooling plate was cooled with a cubic cool down temperature profile from 65 10 C. over 10 hours. The cooling plate was equilibrated at 10 C. for 2 hours and then warmed to 20 C. for analysis. The evaporation plate was left uncapped in a hood overnight to allow evaporation of the solvents. The following day each experiment was wicked to remove the remaining solvent and the plates were removed for analysis. The possible leads from the two studies evaporative and cooling were identified by XRPD and cross polarized light microscopy. Four possible different crystalline leads were identified in the initial acid salt screen as containing crystalline material by XRPD with noticeable differences in the diffractograms with respect to the starting freebase and the bulk acids. These four crystalline leads were selected for scale up experiments as described in Example 2.

1000 uL of the 50 mg ml stock solution of Compound I free base 0.1079 mmol was added into each of ten 4 mL scale up reaction vials. Following the Compound I free base stock solution dispense 1 mole equivalent 0.1079 mmol of acid was added to each scale up experiment. The scale up experiments were then placed into the GeneVac to evaporate off the additional solvents. The crystallization solvents were manually dispensed to each scale up experiment 2 mL total solvent volume per vial . See Table 1 for complete composition of the scale up experiments. The cooling scale up experiments were capped and placed in a 65 C. Torrey Pines oven to equilibrate for 3 hours.

The cooling scale up experiments vials A1 and A2 were cooled with a cubic cool down temperature profile from 65 10 C. over 10 hours. The cooling scale up experiments were equilibrated at 10 C. for 2 hours and then warmed to 20 C. The cooling scale up experiment A2 was removed from the oven and no solids were observed. This scale up experiment was then uncapped and allowed to concentrate at ambient temperature in an attempt to induce crystallization. The evaporative scale up experiments vials A3 and A4 were uncapped and allowed to concentrate at ambient temperature. The isolated solids from scale up experiments were analyzed under a cross polarized light microscope and by thermogravimetry analysis TGA DSC and by XRPD.

Experiment A4 generated the acetic acid salt of Compound I as an amorphous gel. Experiments A1 and A3 generated a crystalline tosylate salt of Compound I. The isolated solids from Experiment A1 showed a gradual weight loss of 0.61 wt possibly due to the loss of residual solvent occurring between 23.4 C. and 179.7 C. and decomposition after 180.0 C. by TGA. The differential scanning calorimetry DSC curve shows a single sharp endotherm melt which has an onset at 162.9 C. and a peak max at 166.0 C. By proton NMR the isolated solid appears to contain a 1 1 mixture of p toluenesulfonic acid Compound I.

Experiment A2 generated a crystalline besylate salt of Compound I. The X ray powder diffractogram XRPD of the isolated solids from Experiment A2 is shown in Figure . This material shows a gradual weight loss of 4.3 wt possibly due to the loss of residual solvent occurring between 19.8 C. and 199.4 C. and decomposition after 200.0 C. by TGA. The DSC curve shows a single small endotherm which has an onset at 62.5 C. and a peak max at 64.9 C. A thermal event or step which occurred at 144.8 C. was also observed on the DSC. By proton NMR the isolated solid appears to contain a 1 1 mixture of benzenesulfonic acid Compound I.

Benzenesulfonic acid salt Solid Compound 1 400 mg 0.86 mmol was dissolved in 1 2 dichloroethane 4 mL . A solution of benzenesulfonic acid hydrate 137 mg 0.86 mmol in 1 2 dichloroethane 5 mL was added. Hexane 1 mL was added and a precipitate began forming. The slurry was stirred for 15 min concentrated suspended in hexane 30 mL and filtered. The solids were washed with hexane 30 mL and dried on the frit to afford Compound I besylate salt as a grayish white solid 454 mg. The solid was recrystallized from 2 propanol hexane to afford an off white solid.

p Toluenesulfonic acid salt Solid Compound 1 400 mg 0.86 mmol was dissolved in 1 2 dichloroethane 5 mL . Solid p toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate 164 mg was added and the mixture was heated at 70 C. for 5 min for complete dissolution. The solution was cooled to room temperature and hexane 2 mL was added. The slurry was filtered and washed with hexane 30 mL and dried on the frit to afford Compound I tosylate as a white solid 450 mg.

To a 100 mL round bottom flask containing a crude solution of Compound I 5.4 g in about 15.5 mL iPAc was added iPAc 40 mL and the mixture was stirred at rt for 16 h. Stirring was stopped and the precipitated solids were removed by decantation. Assay of the supernatant indicated 5.2 g of Compound I

p Toluene sulfonic acid monohydrate 2.172 g 11.418 mmol was charged to iPAc 13.2 mL and the suspension was warmed to 60 C. and stirred until complete dissolution of TsOH approx 5 min . To the hot TsOH solution 60 C. in iPAc the solution of Compound I was added over 2 h. After 20 of free base solution was added addition was stopped. Seed 1 mg Compound I tosylate salt were added and the mixture was stirred for 10 min. Addition of free base was then continued. After the end of the addition the batch was gradually cooled to room temperature over 2 h and let stir at room temperature for 16 h. The agitation was stopped and the batch was filtered. The filter cake was suspended in iPAc 40 mL filtered re suspended in iPAc 40 mL and filtered. The solids were then transferred to a vacuum oven at 30 C. and dried for 18 h to obtain the title compound.

 Basis 1.00 mole 463.38 g of Compound I in a solution of 10 11.5 volumes 4634 5329 mL of Isopropyl Acetate 

p Toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate p TSA 1.00 mole 190.22 g is dissolved in 1158 mL of isopropyl acetate IPAc . The slurry is heated to 57 60 C. to dissolve the pTSA and aged for 30 minutes. Dissolution is confirmed by visual inspection of a sample of the mixture. The mixture is filtered hot 57 60 C. and follow flushed with 463 mL of 57 60 C. isopropyl acetate.

To supersaturate the batch 25 of a solution of Compound I in IPAc typically approx. 10.7 wt is combined with the pTSA IPAc mixture at 57 60 C. Neat IPAc is charged to the vessel to achieve a target of 9 10 wt Compound I tosylate salt. The batch is seeded with 4.6 grams 1 wt based on Compound I of the tosylate salt and the seed bed is aged for 30 minutes at 57 60 C. The remaining 75 of the solution of Compound I in IPAc is charged to the batch over 2 3 hours maintaining the batch temperature at 57 60 C. A controlled cooldown of the batch to 20 25 C. over three hours is performed followed by a 2 hour age at 15 25 C. The slurry is then wet milled at 15 20 C. until steady state particle size is achieved. An optional heat cool cycle can be performed for the dissolution of fines. The heat cool cycle consists of heating the batch to 57 60 C. aging for 15 minutes and then cooling to 20 C. over 3 hours. After aging the batch for at least 2 hours at 15 20 C. the batch is filtered. Two displacement washes of the cake with 1854 mL of isopropyl acetate are performed. A third displacement wash with 1390 mL of isopropyl acetate is charged directly to the filter. The cake is dried with vacuum and a nitrogen sweep at 55 60 C. until 

 Basis 0.0344 mole 15.96 assay g of Compound I in a solution of 13.5 15.4 volumes 216 246 mL of isopropyl acetate 

To the seed vessel is charged 57.8 mL IPAc followed by 0.289 g of wet milled Compound I tosylate salt to saturate the solution. The mixture is heated to 57 60 C. and then 1.59 g of wet milled Compound I tosylate salt 10 wt seed based on Compound I is added to the vessel. In a separate vessel 0.0344 mole of p toluenesulfonic acid mono hydrate 6.55 g is dissolved in 84 mL of isopropyl acetate. The slurry is heated to 57 60 C. to dissolve the pTSA and aged for 30 minutes. Dissolution is confirmed by visual inspection of a sample of the mixture. The pTSA solution is then cooled to 15 25 C. The pTSA solution and a solution of Compound I in IPAc 0.0344 mole 15.96 assay g in 216 246 mL of IPAc are then added simultaneously to the seed vessel over 10 hours maintaining the crystallization vessel at 57 60 C. A controlled cooldown of the batch to 15 25 C. over three hours is performed followed by a 2 hour age at 15 25 C. The batch is then filtered. Two displacement washes of the cake with 63.8 mL of isopropyl acetate are performed. The cake is dried with vacuum and a nitrogen sweep at 55 60 C. until
