This application refers to a Sequence Listing listed below which is provided as a text document. The text document is entitled PF267P2D1 SeqList.txt 31 012 bytes created Feb. 20 2008 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates to a novel member of the tumor necrosis factor family of receptors. More specifically isolated nucleic acid molecules are provided encoding human Death Domain Containing Receptors DR3 and DR3 V1 . Death Domain Containing Receptor polypeptides are also provided as are vectors host cells and recombinant methods for producing the same. The invention further relates to screening methods for identifying agonists and antagonists of DR3 activity.

Many biological actions for instance response to certain stimuli and natural biological processes are controlled by factors such as cytokines. Many cytokines act through receptors by engaging the receptor and producing an intra cellular response.

For example tumor necrosis factors TNF alpha and beta are cytokines which act through TNF receptors to regulate numerous biological processes including protection against infection and induction of shock and inflammatory disease. The TNF molecules belong to the TNF ligand superfamily and act together with their receptors or counter ligands the TNF receptor superfamily. So far nine members of the TNF ligand superfamily have been identified and ten members of the TNF receptor superfamily have been characterized.

Among the ligands there are included TNF lymphotoxin LT also known as TNF LT found in complex heterotrimer LT 2 FasL CD40L CD27L CD30L 4 1BBL OX40L and nerve growth factor NGF . The superfamily of TNF receptors includes the p55TNF receptor p75TNF receptor TNF receptor related protein FAS antigen or APO 1 CD40 CD27 CD30 4 1BB OX40 low affinity p75 and NGF receptor A. Meager 22 291 295 1994 .

Many members of the TNF ligand superfamily are expressed by activated T cells implying that they are necessary for T cell interactions with other cell types which underlie cell ontogeny and functions. A. Meager supra .

Considerable insight into the essential functions of several members of the TNF receptor family has been gained from the identification and creation of mutants that abolish the expression of these proteins. For example naturally occurring mutations in the FAS antigen and its ligand cause lymphoproliferative disease R. Watanabe Fukunaga et al. 356 314 1992 perhaps reflecting a failure of programmed cell death. Mutations of the CD40 ligand cause an X linked immunodeficiency state characterized by high levels of immunoglobulin M and low levels of immunoglobulin G in plasma indicating faulty T cell dependent B cell activation R. C. Allen et al. 259 990 1993 . Targeted mutations of the low affinity nerve growth factor receptor cause a disorder characterized by faulty sensory innovation of peripheral structures K. F. Lee et al. 69 737 1992 .

TNF and LT are capable of binding to two TNF receptors the 55 and 75 kd TNF receptors . A large number of biological effects elicited by TNF and LT acting through their receptors include hemorrhagic necrosis of transplanted tumors cytotoxicity a role in endotoxic shock inflammation immunoregulation proliferation and anti viral responses as well as protection against the deleterious effects of ionizing radiation. TNF and LT are involved in the pathogenesis of a wide range of diseases including endotoxic shock cerebral malaria tumors autoimmune disease AIDS and graft host rejection B. Beutler and C. Von Huffel 264 667 668 1994 . Mutations in the p55 receptor cause increased susceptibility to microbial infection.

Moreover an about 80 amino acid domain near the C terminus of TNFR1 p55 and Fas was reported as the death domain which is responsible for transducing signals for programmed cell death Tartaglia et al. 74 845 1993 .

Apoptosis or programmed cell death is a physiologic process essential to the normal development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms H. Steller 267 1445 1449 1995 . Derangements of apoptosis contribute to the pathogenesis of several human diseases including cancer neurodegenerative disorders and acquired immune deficiency syndrome C. B. Thompson 267 1456 1462 1995 . Recently much attention has focused on the signal transduction and biological function of two cell surface death receptors Fas APO 1 and TNFR 1 J. L. Cleveland et al. 81 479 482 1995 A. Fraser et al. 85 781 784 1996 S. Nagata et al. 267 1449 56 1995 . Both are members of the TNF receptor family which also include TNFR 2 low affinity NGFR CD40 and CD30 among others C. A. Smith et al. 248 1019 23 1990 M. Tewari et al. in M. Purton Heldin Carl Ed. Chapman and Hall London 1995 . While family members are defined by the presence of cysteine rich repeats in their extracellular domains Fas APO 1 and TNFR 1 also share a region of intracellular homology appropriately designated the death domain which is distantly related to the suicide gene reaper P. Golstein et al. 81 185 6 1995 K. White et al. 264 677 83 1994 . This shared death domain suggests that both receptors interact with a related set of signal transducing molecules that until recently remained unidentified. Activation of Fas APO 1 recruits the death domain containing adapter molecule FADD MORT1 A. M. Chinnaiyan et al. 81 505 12 1995 M. P. Boldin et al. 270 7795 8 1995 F. C. Kischkel et al. 14 5579 5588 1995 which in turn binds and presumably activates FLICE MACH1 a member of the ICE CED 3 family of pro apoptotic proteases M. Muzio et al. 85 817 827 1996 M. P. Boldin et al. 85 803 815 1996 . While the central role of Fas APO 1 is to trigger cell death TNFR 1 can signal an array of diverse biological activities many of which stem from its ability to activate NF kB L. A. Tartaglia et al. 13 151 3 1992 . Accordingly TNFR 1 recruits the multivalent adapter molecule TRADD which like FADD also contains a death domain H. Hsu et al. 81 495 504 1995 H. Hsu et al. 84 299 308 1996 . Through its associations with a number of signaling molecules including FADD TRAF2 and RIP TRADD can signal both apoptosis and NF kB activation Id. H. Hsu et al. 4 387 396 1996 .

The effects of TNF family ligands and TNF family receptors are varied and influence numerous functions both normal and abnormal in the biological processes of the mammalian system. There is a clear need therefore for identification and characterization of such receptors and ligands that influence biological activity both normally and in disease states. In particular there is a need to isolate and characterize novel members of the TNF receptor family.

The present invention provides for isolated nucleic acid molecules comprising or alternatively consisting of nucleic acid sequences encoding the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NO 2 and SEQ ID NO 4 or the amino acid sequence encoding the cDNAs deposited as ATCC Deposit No. 97456 on Mar. 1 1996 and ATCC Deposit No. 97757 on Oct. 10 1996.

The present invention also provides vectors and host cells for recombinant expression of the nucleic acid molecules described herein as well as to methods of making such vectors and host cells and for using them for production of DR3 or DR3 Variant 1 DR3 V1 formerly named DDCR polypeptides or peptides by recombinant techniques.

The invention further provides an isolated DR3 or DR3 V1 polypeptide having an amino acid sequence encoded by a polynucleotide described herein.

The present invention also provides diagnostic assays such as quantitative and diagnostic assays for detecting levels of DR3 or DR3 V1 protein. Thus for instance a diagnostic assay in accordance with the invention for detecting over expression of DR3 or DR3 V1 or soluble form thereof compared to normal control tissue samples may be used to detect the presence of tumors.

Tumor Necrosis Factor TNF family ligands are known to be among the most pleiotropic cytokines inducing a large number of cellular responses including cytotoxicity anti viral activity immunoregulatory activities and the transcriptional regulation of several genes. Cellular response to TNF family ligands include not only normal physiological responses but also diseases associated with increased apoptosis or the inhibition of apoptosis. Apoptosis programmed cell death is a physiological mechanism involved in the deletion of peripheral T lymphocytes of the immune system and its dysregulation can lead to a number of different pathogenic processes. Diseases associated with increased cell survival or the inhibition of apoptosis include cancers autoimmune disorders viral infections inflammation graft v. host disease acute graft rejection and chronic graft rejection. Diseases associated with increased apoptosis include AIDS neurodegenerative disorders myelodysplastic syndromes ischemic injury toxin induced liver disease septic shock cachexia and anorexia.

Thus the invention further provides a method for enhancing apoptosis induced by a TNF family ligand which involves administering to a cell which expresses the DR3 polypeptide an effective amount of an agonist capable of increasing DR3 mediated signaling. Preferably DR3 mediated signaling is increased to treat and or prevent a disease wherein decreased apoptosis is exhibited. Examples of such diseases include but are not limited to graft vs. host disease acute and or chronic multiple sclerosis Sjogren s syndrome Grave s disease Hashimoto s thyroiditis autoimmune diabetes biliary cirrhosis Behcet s disease Crohn s disease polymyositis systemic lupus erythematosus immune related glomerulonephritis autoimmune gastritis thrombocytopenic purpura rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis.

In a further aspect the present invention is directed to a method for inhibiting apoptosis induced by a TNF family ligand which involves administering to a cell which expresses the DR3 polypeptide an effective amount of an antagonist capable of decreasing DR3 mediated signaling. Preferably DR3 mediated signaling is decreased to treat and or prevent a disease wherein increased apoptosis is exhibited.

Whether any candidate agonist or antagonist of the present invention can enhance or inhibit apoptosis can be determined using art known TNF family ligand receptor cellular response assays including those described in more detail below. Thus in a further aspect a screening method is provided for determining whether a candidate agonist or antagonist is capable of enhancing or inhibiting a cellular response to a TNF family ligand. The method involves contacting cells which express the DR3 or DR3 V1 polypeptide with a candidate compound and a TNF family ligand assaying a cellular response and comparing the cellular response to a standard cellular response the standard being assayed when contact is made with the ligand in absence of the candidate compound whereby an increased cellular response over the standard indicates that the candidate compound is an agonist of the ligand receptor signaling pathway and a decreased cellular response compared to the standard indicates that the candidate compound is an antagonist of the ligand receptor signaling pathway. By the invention a cell expressing the DR3 or DR3 V1 polypeptide can be contacted with either an endogenous or exogenously administered TNF family ligand.

The present invention provides isolated nucleic acid molecules comprising or alternatively consisting of a nucleic acid sequence encoding the DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptide whose amino acid sequence is shown in SEQ ID NO 2 and SEQ ID NO 4 respectively or a fragment of the polypeptide. The DR3 V1 and DR3 polypeptides of the present invention share sequence homology with human TNF RI and Fas . The nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 1 was obtained by sequencing the HTTNB61 clone which was deposited on Mar. 1 1996 at the American Type Culture Collection 10801 University Blvd. Manassas Va. 20110 2209 USA and given Accession Number 97456. The deposited cDNA is contained in the pBluescript SK plasmid Stratagene LaJolla Calif. . The nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 3 was obtained by sequencing a cDNA obtained from a HUVEC library which was deposited on Oct. 10 1996 at the American Type Culture Collection 10801 University Blvd. Manassas Va. 20110 2209 USA and given Accession Number 97757. The deposited cDNA is contained in the pBluescript SK plasmid Stratagene La Jolla Calif. .

Unless otherwise indicated all nucleotide sequences determined by sequencing a DNA molecule herein were determined using an automated DNA sequencer such as the Model 373 from Applied Biosystems Inc. and all amino acid sequences of polypeptides encoded by DNA molecules determined herein were predicted by translation of a DNA sequence determined as above. Therefore as is known in the art for any DNA sequence determined by this automated approach any nucleotide sequence determined herein may contain some errors. Nucleotide sequences determined by automation are typically at least about 90 identical more typically at least about 95 to at least about 99.9 identical to the actual nucleotide sequence of the sequenced DNA molecule. The actual sequence can be more precisely determined by other approaches including manual DNA sequencing methods well known in the art. As is also known in the art a single insertion or deletion in a determined nucleotide sequence compared to the actual sequence will cause a frame shift in translation of the nucleotide sequence such that the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by a determined nucleotide sequence will be completely different from the amino acid sequence actually encoded by the sequenced DNA molecule beginning at the point of such an insertion or deletion.

By isolated polypeptide or protein is intended a polypeptide or protein removed from its native environment. For example recombinantly produced polypeptides and proteins expressed in host cells are considered isolated for purposes of the invention as are native or recombinant polypeptides which have been substantially purified by any suitable technique such as for example the single step purification method disclosed in Smith and Johnson 67 31 40 1988 .

Using the information provided herein such as the nucleic acid sequence set out in SEQ ID NO 1 or SEQ ID NO 3 a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention encoding a DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptide may be obtained using standard cloning and screening procedures such as those for cloning cDNAs using mRNA as starting material. Illustrative of the invention the nucleic acid molecule described in SEQ ID NO 1 was discovered in a cDNA library derived from cells of a human testis tumor. Also illustrative of the invention the nucleic acid molecule described in SEQ ID NO 3 was discovered in a human HUVEC cDNA library. In addition the genes of the present invention have also been identified in cDNA libraries of the following tissues fetal liver fetal brain tonsil and leukocyte. Furthermore multiple forms of DR3 transcript are seen in Northern Blots and PCR reactions indicating that multiple variants of the transcript exists possibly due to alternate splicing of the message.

The DR3 V1 formerly called DDCR gene contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of about 428 amino acid residues whose initiation codon is at position 198 200 of the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO.1 with a leader sequence of about 35 amino acid residues and a deduced molecular weight of about 47 kDa. Of known members of the TNF receptor family the DR3 V1 polypeptide of the invention shares the greatest degree of homology with human TNF R1. The DR3 V1 polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO 2 is about 20 identical and about 50 similar to human TNF R1.

The DR3 gene contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of about 417 amino acid residues whose initiation codon is at position 1 3 of the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 3 with a leader sequence of about 24 amino acid residues and a deduced molecular weight of about 43 kDa. Of known members of the TNF receptor family the DR3 polypeptide of the invention shares the greatest degree of homology with human TNF R1. The DR3 polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO 3 is about 20 identical and about 50 similar to human TNF R1.

As indicated the present invention also provides the mature form s of the DR3 V1 and DR3 protein of the present invention. According to the signal hypothesis proteins secreted by mammalian cells have a signal or secretory leader sequence which is cleaved from the mature protein once export of the growing protein chain across the rough endoplasmic reticulum has been initiated. Most mammalian cells and even insect cells cleave secreted proteins with the same specificity. However in some cases cleavage of a secreted protein is not entirely uniform which results in two or more mature species of the protein. Further it has long been known that the cleavage specificity of a secreted protein is ultimately determined by the primary structure of the complete protein that is it is inherent in the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide. Therefore the present invention provides a nucleotide sequence encoding the mature DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptides having the amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNAs contained in the host identified as ATCC Deposit No. 97456 or 97757 respectively and as shown in SEQ ID NO 2 and SEQ ID NO 4. By the mature DR3 V1 or DR3 protein having the amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNAs contained in the host identified as ATCC Deposit No. 97456 or 97757 respectively is meant the mature form s of the DR3 V1 or DR3 protein produced by expression in a mammalian cell e.g. COS cells as described below of the complete open reading frame encoded by the human DNA sequence of the cDNA contained in the vector in the deposited host. As indicated below the mature DR3 V1 or DR3 having the amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNAs contained in ATCC Deposit No. 97456 or 97757 respectively may or may not differ from the predicted mature DR3 V1 protein shown in SEQ ID NO 2 amino acids from about 36 to about 428 or DR3 protein shown in SEQ ID NO 4 amino acids from about 24 to about 417 depending on the accuracy of the predicted cleavage site based on computer analysis.

Methods for predicting whether a protein has a secretory leader as well as the cleavage point for that leader sequence are available. For instance the method of McGeoch 3 271 286 1985 and von Heinje 14 4683 4690 1986 can be used. The accuracy of predicting the cleavage points of known mammalian secretory proteins for each of these methods is in the range of 75 80 . von Heinje supra. However the two methods do not always produce the same predicted cleavage point s for a given protein.

In the present case the predicted amino acid sequences of the complete DR3 V1 and DR3 polypeptides of the present invention were analyzed by a computer program PSORT see K. Nakai and M. Kanehisa 14 897 911 1992 which is an expert system for predicting the cellular location of a protein based on the amino acid sequence. As part of this computational prediction of localization the methods of McGeoch and von Heinje are incorporated. The analysis by the PSORT program predicted the cleavage sites between amino acids 35 and 36 in SEQ ID NO 2 and between amino acids 24 and 25 in SEQ ID NO 4. Thereafter the complete amino acid sequences were further analyzed by visual inspection applying a simple form of the 1 3 rule of von Heine. von Heinje supra. Thus the leader sequence for the DR3 V1 protein is predicted to consist of amino acid residues 1 35 in SEQ ID NO 2 while the predicted mature DR3 V1 protein consists of residues 36 428. The leader sequence for the DR3 protein is predicted to consist of amino acid residues 1 24 in SEQ ID NO 4 while the predicted mature DR3 protein consists of residues 25 417.

As one of ordinary skill would appreciate due to the possibilities of sequencing errors discussed above as well as the variability of cleavage sites for leaders in different known proteins the actual DR3 V1 polypeptide encoded by the deposited cDNA comprises about 428 amino acids but may be anywhere in the range of 410 440 amino acids and the actual leader sequence of this protein is about 35 amino acids but may be anywhere in the range of about 25 to about 45 amino acids. The actual DR3 polypeptide encoded by the deposited cDNA comprises about 417 amino acids but may be anywhere in the range of 400 430 amino acids and the actual leader sequence of this protein is about 24 amino acids but may be anywhere in the range of about 14 to about 34 amino acids.

As indicated nucleic acid molecules of the present invention may be in the form of RNA such as mRNA or in the form of DNA including for instance cDNA and genomic DNA obtained by cloning or produced synthetically. The DNA may be double stranded or single stranded. Single stranded DNA may be the coding strand also known as the sense strand or it may be the non coding strand also referred to as the anti sense strand.

By isolated nucleic acid molecule s is intended a nucleic acid molecule DNA or RNA which has been removed from its native environment. For example recombinant DNA molecules contained in a vector are considered isolated for the purposes of the present invention. Further examples of isolated DNA molecules include recombinant DNA molecules maintained in heterologous host cells or purified partially or substantially DNA molecules in solution. Isolated RNA molecules include in vivo or in vitro RNA transcripts of the DNA molecules of the present invention. Isolated nucleic acid molecules according to the present invention further include such molecules produced synthetically.

However a nucleic acid contained in a clone that is a member of a library e.g. a genomic or cDNA library that has not been isolated from other members of the library e.g. in the form of a homogeneous solution containing the clone and other members of the library or a chromosome isolated or removed from a cell or a cell lysate e.g. a chromosome spread as in a karyotype is not isolated for the purposes of the invention. As discussed further herein isolated nucleic acid molecules according to the present invention may be produced naturally recombinantly or synthetically.

Isolated nucleic acid molecules of the present invention include DR3 V1 DNA molecules comprising or alternatively consisting of an open reading frame ORF shown in SEQ ID NO 1 and further include DNA molecules which comprise or alternatively consist of a sequence substantially different than all or part of the ORF whose initiation codon is at position 198 200 of the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 1 but which due to the degeneracy of the genetic code still encode the DR3 V1 polypeptide or a fragment thereof. Isolated nucleic acid molecules of the present invention also include DR3 DNA molecules comprising or alternatively consisting of an open reading frame ORF shown in SEQ ID NO 3 and further include DNA molecules which comprise or alternatively consist of a sequence substantially different than all or part of the ORF whose initiation codon is at position 1 3 of the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 3 but which due to the degeneracy of the genetic code still encode the DR3 polypeptide or a fragment thereof. Of course the genetic code is well known in the art. Thus it would be routine for one skilled in the art to generate such degenerate variants.

In another aspect the invention provides isolated nucleic acid molecules encoding the DR3 V1 polypeptide having an amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNA contained in the plasmid deposited as ATCC Deposit No. 97456 on Mar. 1 1996. The invention provides isolated nucleic acid molecules encoding the DR3 polypeptide having an amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNA contained in the plasmid deposited as ATCC Deposit No. 97757 on Oct. 10 1996. Preferably these nucleic acid molecules will encode the mature polypeptide encoded by the above described deposited cDNAs. The invention further provides an isolated nucleic acid molecule having the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 1 or SEQ ID NO 3 or the nucleotide sequence of the DR3 V1 or DR3 cDNA contained in the above described deposited plasmids or a nucleic acid molecule having a sequence complementary to one of the above sequences. Such isolated DNA molecules and fragments thereof are useful for example as DNA probes for gene mapping by in situ hybridization with chromosomes and for detecting expression of the DR3 V1 or DR3 gene in human tissue including testis tumor tissue by Northern blot analysis.

DR3 expression has been detected in a wide range of tissues and cell types including endothelial cells liver cells hepatocellular tumor lymph nodes Hodgkin s lymphoma tonsil bone marrow spleen heart thymus pericardium healing wound skin brain pancreas tumor burned skin U937 cells testis colon cancer metasticized to liver pancreas rejected kidney adipose ovary olfactory epithelium striatum depression HeLa cells LNCAP upon treatment with 30 nM androgen 8 week embryo tissues 9 week embryo tissues fetal brain tissues fetal kidney tissues fetal heart tissues fetal thymus tissues fetal lung tissues fetal liver tissues fetal spleen tissues T cell helper II activated T cell 16 hr activated T cell 24 hr primary dendritic cells eosinophils monocytes keratinocytes and HUVEC human umbilical vein endothelial cells .

The present invention is further directed to polynucleotides comprising or alternatively consisting of fragments of the isolated nucleic acid molecules described herein. By a fragment of an isolated nucleic acid molecule having the nucleotide sequence of one of the deposited cDNAs or the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 1 or SEQ ID NO 3 is intended fragments at least about 15 nt and more preferably at least about 20 nt still more preferably at least about 30 nt and even more preferably at least about 40 nt in length which are useful as diagnostic probes and primers as discussed herein. In this context about includes the particularly recited value and values larger or smaller by several 5 4 3 2 or 1 nucleotides. Of course larger fragments comprising or alternatively consisting of at least 50 75 100 125 150 175 200 225 250 275 300 325 350 375 400 425 450 475 500 525 550 575 600 625 650 675 700 725 750 775 800 825 850 875 900 925 950 975 1000 1025 1050 1075 1100 1125 1150 1175 1200 1225 1250 or 1283 nt are also useful according to the present invention as are fragments corresponding to most if not all of the nucleotide sequence of one of the deposited cDNAs or as shown in SEQ ID NO 1 or SEQ ID NO 3. By a fragment at least 20 nt in length for example is intended fragments which include 20 or more contiguous bases from the nucleotide sequence of one of the deposited cDNAs or the nucleotide sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO 1 or SEQ ID NO 3.

The present invention is further directed to polynucleotides comprising or alternatively consisting of fragments of isolated nucleic acid molecules which encode subportions of DR3 V1 and DR3. In particular the invention provides polynucleotides comprising or alternatively consisting of the nucleotide sequences of a member selected from the group consisting of nucleotides 198 257 208 267 218 277 228 287 238 297 248 307 258 317 268 327 278 337 288 347 298 357 308 367 318 377 328 387 338 397 348 407 358 417 368 427 378 437 388 447 398 457 408 469 428 487 458 517 478 537 498 557 518 577 538 597 558 617 578 637 598 657 638 697 658 717 698 757 708 767 718 767 728 787 738 797 748 807 758 817 778 837 788 847 808 867 828 887 848 907 868 927 888 947 898 957 908 967 918 977 928 987 948 1007 968 1027 988 1047 998 1067 1018 1077 1038 1097 1058 1117 1068 1127 1088 1147 1098 1157 1118 1177 1138 1197 1158 1217 1178 1237 1198 1257 1218 1277 1238 1297 1258 1317 1278 1337 1298 1357 1318 1377 1338 1397 1358 1417 1378 1437 1398 1457 1418 1477 and 1428 1481 of SEQ ID NO 1.

In this context about includes the particularly recited value and values larger or smaller by several 5 4 3 2 or 1 amino acids. Since the location of these domains have been predicted by computer graphics one of ordinary skill would appreciate that the amino acid residues constituting these domains may vary slightly e.g. by about 1 to 15 residues depending on the criteria used to define the domain. Polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides are also encompassed by the invention.

The invention also provides polynucleotides comprising or alternatively consisting of nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid residues from about 1 to about 215 of SEQ ID NO 2 amino acid residues from about 30 to about 215 of SEQ ID NO 2 amino acid residues from about 215 to about 240 of SEQ ID NO 2 amino acid residues from about 240 to about 428 of SEQ ID NO 2 and amino acid residues from about 350 to about 420 of SEQ ID NO 2. In this context about includes the particularly recited value and values larger or smaller by several 5 4 3 2 or 1 amino acids. Polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides are also encompassed by the invention.

Preferred nucleic acid fragments of the present invention further include nucleic acid molecules encoding epitope bearing portions of the DR3 V1 protein. In particular such nucleic acid fragments of the present invention include nucleic acid molecules encoding a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues from about 1 to about 22 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues from about 33 to about 56 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues from about 59 to about 82 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues from about 95 to about 112 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues from about 122 to about 133 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues from about 161 to about 177 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues from about 179 to about 190 in SEQ ID NO 2 and a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues from about 196 to about 205 in SEQ ID NO 2. In this context about includes the particularly recited value and values larger or smaller by several 5 4 3 2 or 1 amino acids. The inventors have determined that the above polypeptide fragments are antigenic regions of the DR3 V1 protein. Methods for determining other such epitope bearing portions of the DR3 V1 protein are described in detail below. Polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides are also encompassed by the invention.

Preferred nucleic acid fragments of the present invention also include nucleic acid molecules encoding epitope bearing portions of the DR3 protein. In particular such nucleic acid fragments of the present invention include nucleic acid molecules encoding the corresponding regions to those epitope bearing regions of the DR3 V1 protein disclosed above. Methods for determining other such epitope bearing portions of the DR3 protein are described in detail below.

In another aspect the invention provides an isolated nucleic acid molecule comprising or alternatively consisting of a polynucleotide which hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a portion of the polynucleotide in a nucleic acid molecule of the invention described above for instance the complement of a polynucleotide fragment described herein or the cDNA plasmids contained in ATCC Deposit 97456 or ATCC Deposit 97757. By stringent hybridization conditions is intended overnight incubation at 42 C. in a solution comprising or alternatively consisting of 50 formamide 5 SSC 750 mM NaCl 75 mM trisodium citrate 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.6 5 Denhardt s solution 10 dextran sulfate and 20 g ml denatured sheared salmon sperm DNA followed by washing the filters in 0.1 SSC at about 65 C.

By a polynucleotide which hybridizes to a portion of a polynucleotide is intended a polynucleotide either DNA or RNA hybridizing to at least about 15 nucleotides nt and more preferably at least about 20 nt still more preferably at least about 30 nt and even more preferably about 30 70 nt of the reference polynucleotide. These are useful as diagnostic probes and primers as discussed above and in more detail below. In this context about includes the particularly recited value and values larger or smaller by several 5 4 3 2 or 1 nucleotides.

By a portion of a polynucleotide of at least 20 nt in length for example is intended 20 or more contiguous nucleotides from the nucleotide sequence of the reference polynucleotide e.g. the deposited cDNAs or the nucleotide sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO 1 or SEQ ID NO 3 .

Of course a polynucleotide which hybridizes only to a poly A sequence such as the 3 terminal poly A tract of the DR3 V1 cDNA shown in SEQ ID NO 1 or to a complementary stretch of T or U resides would not be included in a polynucleotide of the invention used to hybridize to a portion of a nucleic acid of the invention since such a polynucleotide would hybridize to any nucleic acid molecule containing a poly A stretch or the complement thereof e.g. practically any double stranded cDNA clone generated from an oligo dT primed cDNA library .

As indicated nucleic acid molecules of the present invention which encode the DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptide may include but are not limited to the coding sequence for the mature polypeptide by itself the coding sequence for the mature polypeptide and additional sequences such as those encoding a leader or secretary sequence such as a pre or pro or prepro protein sequence the coding sequence of the mature polypeptide with or without the aforementioned additional coding sequences together with additional non coding sequences including for example but not limited to introns and non coding 5 and 3 sequences such as the transcribed non translated sequences that play a role in transcription mRNA processing including splicing and polyadenylation signals for example ribosome binding and stability of mRNA additional coding sequence which codes for additional amino acids such as those which provide additional functionalities. Thus for instance the polypeptide may be fused to a marker sequence such as a peptide which facilitates purification of the fused polypeptide. In certain preferred embodiments of this aspect of the invention the marker sequence is a hexa histidine peptide such as the tag provided in a pQE vector Qiagen Inc. among others many of which are commercially available. As described in Gentz et al. 86 821 824 1989 for instance hexa histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. The HA tag corresponds to an epitope derived of influenza hemagglutinin protein which has been described by Wilson et al. 37 767 1984 for instance.

The present invention further relates to variants of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention which encode for fragments analogs or derivatives of the DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptide. Variants may occur naturally such as an allelic variant. By an allelic variant is intended one of several alternate forms of a gene occupying a given locus on a chromosome of an organism. Lewin B. ed. John Wiley Sons New York 1985 . Non naturally occurring variants may be produced using art known mutagenesis techniques.

Such variants include those produced by nucleotide substitutions deletions or additions which may involve one or more nucleotides. The variants may be altered in coding or non coding regions or both. Alterations in the coding regions may produce conservative or non conservative amino acid substitutions deletions or additions.

Further embodiments of the invention include isolated nucleic acid molecules that are at least 80 identical and more preferably at least 85 90 92 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to a a nucleotide sequence encoding the full length DR3 V1 polypeptide having the complete amino acid sequence in SEQ ID NO 2 including the predicted leader sequence b nucleotide sequence encoding the full length DR3 polypeptide having the complete amino acid sequence in SEQ ID NO 4 including the predicted leader sequence c a nucleotide sequence encoding the mature DR3 V1 polypeptide full length polypeptide with the leader removed having the amino acid sequence at positions about 36 to about 428 in SEQ ID NO 2 d a nucleotide sequence encoding the full length DR3 V1 polypeptide having the complete amino acid sequence including the leader encoded by the cDNA contained in ATCC Deposit No. 97456 e a nucleotide sequence encoding the full length DR3 polypeptide having the complete amino acid sequence including the leader encoded by the cDNA contained in ATCC Deposit No. 97757 f a nucleotide sequence encoding the mature DR3 V1 polypeptide having the amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNA contained in ATCC Deposit No. 97456 g a nucleotide sequence encoding the mature DR3 V1 polypeptide having the amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNA contained in ATCC Deposit No. 97757 h a nucleotide sequence that encodes the DR3 extracellular domain i a nucleotide sequence that encodes the DR3 transmembrane domain j a nucleotide sequence that encodes the DR3 intracellular domain k a nucleotide sequence that encodes the DR3 death domain or l a nucleotide sequence complementary to any of the nucleotide sequences in a b c d e f g h i j or k above. In this context about includes the particularly recited value and values larger or smaller by several 5 4 3 2 or 1 amino acids. Polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides are also encompassed by the invention.

By a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least for example 95 identical to a reference nucleotide sequence encoding a DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptide is intended that the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotide is identical to the reference sequence except that the polynucleotide sequence may include up to five mismatches per each 100 nucleotides of the reference nucleotide sequence encoding DR3 V1 or DR3. In other words to obtain a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least 95 identical to a reference nucleotide sequence up to 5 of the nucleotides in the reference sequence may be deleted or substituted with another nucleotide or a number of nucleotides up to 5 of the total nucleotides in the reference sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence. These mismatches of the reference sequence may occur at the 5 or 3 terminal positions of the reference nucleotide sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions interspersed either individually among nucleotides in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence. The reference query sequence may be the entire DR3 V1 or DR3 encoding nucleotide sequence shown respectively in SEQ ID NO 2 and SEQ ID NO 4 or any DR3 V1 or DR3 polynucleotide fragment e.g. a polynucleotide encoding the amino acid sequence of any of the DR3 V1 or DR3 N and or C terminal deletions described herein variant derivative or analog as described herein.

As a practical matter whether any particular nucleic acid molecule is at least 80 85 90 92 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to for instance the encoding nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 2 or SEQ ID NO 4 or to the nucleotide sequence of the deposited cDNAs can be determined conventionally using known computer programs such as the Bestfit program Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package Version 8 for Unix Genetics Computer Group University Research Park 575 Science Drive Madison Wis. 53711 . Bestfit uses the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman Advances in Applied Mathematics 2 482 489 1981 to find the best segment of homology between two sequences. When using Bestfit or any other sequence alignment program to determine whether a particular sequence is for instance 95 identical to a reference sequence according to the present invention the parameters are set of course such that the percentage of identity is calculated over the full length of the reference nucleotide sequence and that gaps in homology of up to 5 of the total number of nucleotides in the reference sequence are allowed.

In a specific embodiment the identity between a reference query sequence a sequence of the present invention and a subject sequence also referred to as a global sequence alignment is determined using the FASTDB computer program based on the algorithm of Brutlag et al. 6 237 245 1990 . Preferred parameters used in a FASTDB alignment of DNA sequences to calculate percent identity are Matrix Unitary k tuple 4 Mismatch Penalty 1 Joining Penalty 30 Randomization Group Length 0 Cutoff Score 1 Gap Penalty 5 Gap Size Penalty 0.05 Window Size 500 or the length of the subject nucleotide sequence whichever is shorter. According to this embodiment if the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence because of 5 or 3 deletions not because of internal deletions a manual correction is made to the results to take into consideration the fact that the FASTDB program does not account for 5 and 3 truncations of the subject sequence when calculating percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the 5 or 3 ends relative to the query sequence the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of bases of the query sequence that are 5 and 3 of the subject sequence which are not matched aligned as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. A determination of whether a nucleotide is matched aligned is determined by results of the FASTDB sequence alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity calculated by the above FASTDB program using the specified parameters to arrive at a final percent identity score. This corrected score is what is used for the purposes of this embodiment. Only bases outside the 5 and 3 bases of the subject sequence as displayed by the FASTDB alignment which are not matched aligned with the query sequence are calculated for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score. For example a 90 base subject sequence is aligned to a 100 base query sequence to determine percent identity. The deletions occur at the 5 end of the subject sequence and therefore the FASTDB alignment does not show a matched alignment of the first 10 bases at 5 end. The 10 unpaired bases represent 10 of the sequence number of bases at the 5 and 3 ends not matched total number of bases in the query sequence so 10 is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the FASTDB program. If the remaining 90 bases were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90 . In another example a 90 base subject sequence is compared with a 100 base query sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so that there are no bases on the 5 or 3 of the subject sequence which are not matched aligned with the query. In this case the percent identity calculated by FASTDB is not manually corrected. Once again only bases 5 and 3 of the subject sequence which are not matched aligned with the query sequence are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are made for the purposes of this embodiment.

The present application is directed to nucleic acid molecules at least 80 85 90 92 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 1 SEQ ID NO 3 or to the nucleic acid sequence of the deposited cDNAs irrespective of whether they encode a polypeptide having DR3 functional activity. The present application is also directed to nucleic acid molecules at least 80 85 90 92 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to the nucleic acid sequences disclosed herein e.g. nucleic acid sequences encoding a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of an N and or C terminal deletion disclosed herein such as for example a nucleic acid molecule encoding amino acids 30 to 200 30 to 215 215 to 240 240 to 428 350 to 420 or 2 to 428 of SEQ ID NO 2 irrespective of whether they encode a polypeptide having DR3 functional activity. This is because even where a particular nucleic acid molecule does not encode a polypeptide having DR3 functional activity one of skill in the art would still know how to use the nucleic acid molecule for instance as a hybridization probe or a polymerase chain reaction PCR primer. Uses of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention that do not encode a polypeptide having DR3 functional activity include inter alia 1 isolating the DR3 gene or allelic variants thereof in a cDNA library 2 in situ hybridization e.g. FISH to metaphase chromosomal spreads to provide precise chromosomal location of the DR3 V1 or DR3 gene as described in Verma et al. Pergamon Press New York 1988 and 3 Northern Blot analysis for detecting DR3 V1 or DR3 mRNA expression in specific tissues.

Preferred however are nucleic acid molecules having sequences at least 80 85 90 92 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 1 SEQ ID NO 3 or to the nucleic acid sequence of the deposited cDNAs which do in fact encode a polypeptide having DR3 functional activity. By a polypeptide having DR3 functional activity is intended polypeptides exhibiting activity similar but not necessarily identical to an activity of the DR3 proteins of the invention either the full length protein or preferably the mature protein as measured in a particular biological assay. For example a DR3 V1 or DR3 functional activity can routinely be measured by determining the ability of a DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptide to bind a DR3 V1 or DR3 ligand e.g. TNF NF kB TRADD . Further DR3 functional activity can be measured using the cell death assays performed essentially as previously described A. M. Chinnaiyan et al. 81 505 12 1995 M. P. Boldin et al. 270 7795 8 1995 F. C. Kischkel et al. 14 5579 5588 1995 A. M. Chinnaiyan et al. 271 4961 4965 1996 and as set forth in Example 6 below. In MCF7 cells plasmids encoding full length DR3 or a candidate death domain containing receptors are co transfected with the pLantern reporter construct encoding green fluorescent protein. Nuclei of cells transfected with DR3 will exhibit apoptotic morphology as assessed by DAPI staining. Similar to TNFR 1 and Fas APO 1 M. Muzio et al. 85 817 827 1996 M. P. Boldin et al. 85 803 815 1996 M. Tewari et al. 270 3255 60 1995 DR3 induced apoptosis is blocked by the inhibitors of ICE like proteases CrmA and z VAD fmk. In addition apoptosis induced by DR3 is also blocked by dominant negative versions of FADD FADD DN or FLICE FLICE DN MACHalC360S .

The functional activity of DR3 polypeptides and fragments variants derivatives and analogs thereof can be assayed by various methods.

For example in one embodiment where one is assaying for the ability to bind or compete with full length polypeptide for binding to anti DR3 antibody various immunoassays known in the art can be used including but not limited to competitive and non competitive assay systems using techniques such as radioimmunoassays ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay sandwich immunoassays immunoradiometric assays gel diffusion precipitation reactions immunodiffusion assays in situ immunoassays using colloidal gold enzyme or radioisotope labels for example western blots precipitation reactions agglutination assays e.g. gel agglutination assays hemagglutination assays complement fixation assays immunofluorescence assays protein A assays and immunoelectrophoresis assays etc. In one embodiment antibody binding is detected by detecting a label on the primary antibody. In another embodiment the primary antibody is detected by detecting binding of a secondary antibody or reagent to the primary antibody. In a further embodiment the secondary antibody is labeled. Many means are known in the art for detecting binding in an immunoassay and are within the scope of the present invention.

In another embodiment where a ligand is identified e.g. TNF International Publication No. WO 00 08139 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference or the ability of a polypeptide fragment variant or derivative of the invention to multimerize is being evaluated binding can be assayed e.g. by means well known in the art such as for example reducing and non reducing gel chromatography protein affinity chromatography and affinity blotting. See generally Phizicky E. et al. 1995 59 94 123. In another embodiment physiological correlates of binding to its substrates signal transduction can be assayed.

Of course due to the degeneracy of the genetic code one of ordinary skill in the art will immediately recognize that a large number of the nucleic acid molecules having a sequence at least 80 85 90 92 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to the nucleic acid sequence of the deposited cDNAs the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 2 or SEQ ID NO 4 or fragments thereof will encode polypeptides having DR3 functional activity. In fact since degenerate variants of any of these nucleotide sequences all encode the same polypeptide in many instances this will be clear to the skilled artisan even without performing the above described comparison assay. It will be further recognized in the art that for such nucleic acid molecules that are not degenerate variants a reasonable number will also encode a polypeptide having DR3 functional activity. This is because the skilled artisan is fully aware of amino acid substitutions that are either less likely or not likely to significantly effect protein function e.g. replacing one aliphatic amino acid with a second aliphatic amino acid as further described below.

For example guidance concerning how to make phenotypically silent amino acid substitutions is provided in Bowie J. U. et al. Deciphering the Message in Protein Sequences Tolerance to Amino Acid Substitutions 247 1306 1310 1990 wherein the authors indicate that proteins are surprisingly tolerant of amino acid substitutions.

This invention is also related to the use of the DR3 V1 or DR3 polynucleotides to detect complementary polynucleotides such as for example as a diagnostic reagent. Detection of a mutated form of DR3 V1 or DR3 associated with a dysfunction will provide a diagnostic tool that can add or define a diagnosis of a disease or susceptibility to a disease which results from under expression over expression or altered expression of DR3 V1 or DR3 or a soluble form thereof such as for example tumors or autoimmune disease.

Individuals carrying mutations in the DR3 V1 or DR3 gene may be detected at the DNA level by a variety of techniques. Nucleic acids for diagnosis may be obtained from a patient s cells such as from blood urine saliva tissue biopsy and autopsy material. The genomic DNA may be used directly for detection or may be amplified enzymatically by using PCR prior to analysis. Saiki et al. 324 163 166 1986 . RNA or cDNA may also be used in the same ways. As an example PCR primers complementary to the nucleic acid encoding DR3 V1 or DR3 can be used to identify and analyze DR3 V1 or DR3 expression and mutations. For example deletions and insertions can be detected by a change in size of the amplified product in comparison to the normal genotype. Point mutations can be identified by hybridizing amplified DNA to radiolabeled DR3 V1 or DR3 RNA or alternatively radiolabeled DR3 V1 or DR3 antisense DNA sequences. Perfectly matched sequences can be distinguished from mismatched duplexes by RNase A digestion or by differences in melting temperatures.

Sequence differences between a reference gene and genes having mutations also may be revealed by direct DNA sequencing. In addition cloned DNA segments may be employed as probes to detect specific DNA segments. The sensitivity of such methods can be greatly enhanced by appropriate use of PCR or another amplification method. For example a sequencing primer is used with double stranded PCR product or a single stranded template molecule generated by a modified PCR. The sequence determination is performed by conventional procedures with radiolabeled nucleotide or by automatic sequencing procedures with fluorescent tags.

Genetic testing based on DNA sequence differences may be achieved by detection of alteration in electrophoretic mobility of DNA fragments in gels with or without denaturing agents. Small sequence deletions and insertions can be visualized by high resolution gel electrophoresis. DNA fragments of different sequences may be distinguished on denaturing formamide gradient gels in which the mobilities of different DNA fragments are retarded in the gel at different positions according to their specific melting or partial melting temperatures see e.g. Myers et al. 230 1242 1985 .

Sequence changes at specific locations also may be revealed by nuclease protection assays such as RNase and S1 protection or the chemical cleavage method e.g. Cotton et al. 85 4397 4401 1985 .

Thus the detection of a specific DNA sequence may be achieved by methods such as hybridization RNase protection chemical cleavage direct DNA sequencing or the use of restriction enzymes e.g. restriction fragment length polymorphisms RFLP and Southern blotting of genomic DNA.

In addition to more conventional gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing mutations also can be detected by in situ analysis.

The sequences of the present invention are also valuable for chromosome identification. The sequence is specifically targeted to and can hybridize with a particular location on an individual human chromosome. The mapping of DNAs to chromosomes according to the present invention is an important first step in correlating those sequences with genes associated with disease.

In certain preferred embodiments in this regard the cDNA herein disclosed is used to clone genomic DNA of a DR3 V1 or a DR3 gene. This can be accomplished using a variety of well known techniques and libraries which generally are available commercially. The genomic DNA is then used for in situ chromosome mapping using well known techniques for this purpose.

In addition sequences can be mapped to chromosomes by preparing PCR primers preferably 15 25 bp from the cDNA. Computer analysis of the 3 untranslated region of the gene is used to rapidly select primers that do not span more than one exon in the genomic DNA thus complicating the amplification process. These primers are then used for PCR screening of somatic cell hybrids containing individual human chromosomes.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH of a cDNA clone to a metaphase chromosomal spread can be used to provide a precise chromosomal location in one step. This technique can be used with cDNA as short as 50 or 60. For a review of this technique see Verma et al. Pergamon Press New York 1988 .

Once a sequence has been mapped to a precise chromosomal location the physical position of the sequence on the chromosome can be correlated with genetic map data. Such data are found for example in V. McKusick available on line through Johns Hopkins University Welch Medical Library. The relationship between genes and diseases that have been mapped to the same chromosomal region are then identified through linkage analysis coinheritance of physically adjacent genes .

Next it is necessary to determine the differences in the cDNA or genomic sequence between affected and unaffected individuals. If a mutation is observed in some or all of the affected individuals but not in any normal individuals then the mutation is likely to be the causative agent of the disease.

The present invention also relates to vectors which include DNA molecules of the present invention host cells which are genetically engineered with vectors of the invention and the production of polypeptides of the invention by recombinant techniques.

Host cells can be genetically engineered to incorporate nucleic acid molecules and express polypeptides of the present invention. The polynucleotides may be introduced alone or with other polynucleotides. Such other polynucleotides may be introduced independently co introduced or introduced joined to the polynucleotides of the invention.

In accordance with this aspect of the invention the vector may be for example a plasmid vector a single or double stranded phage vector a single or double stranded RNA or DNA viral vector. Such vectors may be introduced into cells as polynucleotides preferably DNA by well known techniques for introducing DNA and RNA into cells. Viral vectors may be replication competent or replication defective. In the latter case viral propagation generally will occur only in complementing host cells.

Preferred among vectors in certain respects are those for expression of polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention. Generally such vectors comprise cis acting control regions effective for expression in a host operatively linked to the polynucleotide to be expressed. Appropriate trans acting factors either are supplied by the host supplied by a complementing vector or supplied by the vector itself upon introduction into the host.

A great variety of expression vectors can be used to express a polypeptide of the invention. Such vectors include chromosomal episomal and virus derived vectors e.g. vectors derived from bacterial plasmids from bacteriophage from yeast episomes from yeast chromosomal elements from viruses such as baculoviruses papova viruses such as SV40 vaccinia viruses adenoviruses fowl pox viruses pseudorabies viruses and retroviruses and vectors derived from combinations thereof such as those derived from plasmid and bacteriophage genetic elements such as cosmids and phagemids all may be used for expression in accordance with this aspect of the present invention. Generally any vector suitable to maintain propagate or express polynucleotides to express a polypeptide in a host may be used for expression in this regard.

The DNA sequence in the expression vector is operatively linked to appropriate expression control sequence s including for instance a promoter to direct mRNA transcription. Representatives of such promoters include the phage lambda PL promoter the lac trp and tac promoters the SV40 early and late promoters and promoters of retroviral LTRs to name just a few of the well known promoters. In general expression constructs will contain sites for transcription initiation and termination and in the transcribed region a ribosome binding site for translation. The coding portion of the mature transcripts expressed by the constructs will include a translation initiating AUG at the beginning and a termination codon UAA UGA or UAG appropriately positioned at the end of the polypeptide to be translated.

In addition the constructs may contain control regions that regulate as well as engender expression. Generally such regions will operate by controlling transcription such as repressor binding sites and enhancers among others.

Vectors for propagation and expression generally will include selectable markers. Such markers also may be suitable for amplification or the vectors may contain additional markers for this purpose. In this regard the expression vectors preferably contain one or more selectable marker genes to provide a phenotypic trait for selection of transformed host cells. Preferred markers include dihydrofolate reductase or neomycin resistance for eukaryotic cell culture and tetracycline or ampicillin resistance genes for culturing and other bacteria.

The vector containing the appropriate DNA sequence as described elsewhere herein as well as an appropriate promoter and other appropriate control sequences may be introduced into an appropriate host using a variety of well known techniques suitable to expression therein of a desired polypeptide. Representative examples of appropriate hosts include bacterial cells such as and cells fungal cells such as yeast cells insect cells such as S2 and Sf9 cells animal cells such as CHO COS and Bowes melanoma cells and plant cells. Hosts for a great variety of expression constructs are well known and those of skill will be enabled by the present disclosure readily to select a host for expressing a polypeptides in accordance with this aspect of the present invention. Appropriate culture mediums and conditions for the above described host cells are known in the art.

Among vectors preferred for use in bacteria are pQE70 pQE60 and pQE 9 available from Qiagen pBS vectors Phagescript vectors Bluescript vectors pNH8A pNH16a pNH18A pNH46A available from Stratagene and ptrc99a pKK223 3 pKK233 3 pDR540 pRIT5 available from Pharmacia. Among preferred eukaryotic vectors are pWLNEO pSV2CAT pOG44 pXT1 and pSG available from Stratagene and pSVK3 pBPV pMSG and pSVL available from Pharmacia. These vectors are listed solely by way of illustration of the many commercially available and well known vectors available to those of skill in the art.

Selection of appropriate vectors and promoters for expression in a host cell is a well known procedure and the requisite techniques for expression vector construction introduction of the vector into the host and expression in the host are routine skills in the art.

The present invention also relates to host cells containing the above described constructs discussed above. The host cell can be a higher eukaryotic cell such as a mammalian cell or a lower eukaryotic cell such as a yeast cell or the host cell can be a prokaryotic cell such as a bacterial cell.

Introduction of the construct into the host cell can be effected by calcium phosphate transfection DEAE dextran mediated transfection cationic lipid mediated transfection electroporation transduction infection or other methods. Such methods are described in many standard laboratory manuals such as Davis et al. 1986 .

In addition to encompassing host cells containing the vector constructs discussed herein the invention also encompasses primary secondary and immortalized host cells of vertebrate origin particularly mammalian origin that have been engineered to delete or replace endogenous genetic material e.g. the DR3 coding sequence and or to include genetic material e.g. heterologous polynucleotide sequences that is operably associated with DR3 V1 or DR3 polynucleotides of the invention and which activates alters and or amplifies endogenous DR3 V1 or DR3 polynucleotides. For example techniques known in the art may be used to operably associate heterologous control regions e.g. promoter and or enhancer and endogenous DR3 V1 or DR3 polynucleotide sequences via homologous recombination see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 670 issued Jun. 24 1997 International Publication Number WO 96 29411 published Sep. 26 1996 International Publication Number WO 94 12650 published Aug. 4 1994 Koller et al. 86 8932 8935 1989 and Zijlstra et al. 342 435 438 1989 the disclosures of each of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties .

The polypeptide may be expressed in a modified form such as a fusion protein and may include not only secretion signals but also additional heterologous functional regions. Thus for instance a region of additional amino acids particularly charged amino acids may be added to the N terminus of the polypeptide to improve stability and persistence in the host cell during purification or during subsequent handling and storage. Also region also may be added to the polypeptide to facilitate purification. Such regions may be removed prior to final preparation of the polypeptide. The addition of peptide moieties to polypeptides to engender secretion or excretion to improve stability and to facilitate purification among others are familiar and routine techniques in the art. A preferred fusion protein comprises a heterologous region from immunoglobulin that is useful to solubilize proteins. For example EP A O 464 533 Canadian counterpart 2045869 discloses fusion proteins comprising various portions of constant region of immunoglobin molecules together with another human protein or part thereof. In many cases the Fc part in a fusion protein is thoroughly advantageous for use in therapy and diagnosis and thus results for example in improved pharmacokinetic properties EP A 0 232 262 . On the other hand for some uses it would be desirable to be able to delete the Fc part after the fusion protein has been expressed detected and purified in the advantageous manner described. This is the case when Fc portion proves to be a hindrance to use in therapy and diagnosis for example when the fusion protein is to be used as antigen for immunizations. In drug discovery for example human proteins such as hIL 5 receptor has been fused with Fc portions for the purpose of high throughput screening assays to identify antagonists of hIL 5. See D. Bennett et al. Vol. 8 52 58 1995 and K. Johanson et al. Vol. 270 No. 16 9459 9471 1995 .

The DR3 and DR3 V1 polypeptides can be recovered and purified from recombinant cell cultures by well known methods including ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation acid extraction anion or cation exchange chromatography phosphocellulose chromatography hydrophobic interaction chromatography affinity chromatography hydroxylapatite chromatography and lectin chromatography. Most preferably high performance liquid chromatography HPLC is employed for purification. Well known techniques for refolding protein may be employed to regenerate active conformation when the polypeptide is denatured during isolation and or purification.

Polypeptides of the present invention include naturally purified products products of chemical synthetic procedures and products produced by recombinant techniques from a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host including for example bacterial yeast higher plant insect and mammalian cells. Depending upon the host employed in a recombinant production procedure the polypeptides of the present invention may be glycosylated or may be non glycosylated. In addition polypeptides of the invention may also include an initial modified methionine residue in some cases as a result of host mediated processes.

DR3 V1 or DR3 polynucleotides and polypeptides may be used in accordance with the present invention for a variety of applications particularly those that make use of the chemical and biological properties of DR3. Among these are applications in treatment and or prevention of tumors resistance to parasites bacteria and viruses to induce proliferation of T cells endothelial cells and certain hematopoietic cells to treat and or prevent restenosis graft vs. host disease to regulate anti viral responses and to prevent certain autoimmune diseases after stimulation of DR3 by an agonist. Additional applications relate to the prognosis diagnosis prevention and or treatment of disorders of cells tissues and organisms. These aspects of the invention are discussed further below.

The invention further provides an isolated DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptide having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 2 and SEQ ID NO 4 respectively or a fragment thereof. It will be recognized in the art that some amino acid sequence of DR3 V1 or DR3 can be varied without significant effect of the structure or function of the protein. If such differences in sequence are contemplated it should be remembered that there will be critical areas on the protein which determine activity. Such areas will usually comprise residues which make up the ligand binding site or the death domain or which form tertiary structures which affect these domains.

Thus the invention further includes variations of the DR3 V1 or DR3 protein which show substantial DR3 functional activity or which include regions of DR3 V1 or DR3 such as the protein fragments discussed below. Such mutants include deletions insertions inversions repeats and type substitutions. As indicated above guidance concerning which amino acid changes are likely to be phenotypically silent can be found in J. U. Bowie et al. 247 1306 1310 1990 .

Of particular interest are substitutions of charged amino acids with another charged amino acid and with neutral or negatively charged amino acids. The latter results in proteins with reduced positive charge to improve the characteristics of the DR3 V1 or DR3 protein. The prevention of aggregation is highly desirable. Aggregation of proteins not only results in a loss of activity but can also be problematic when preparing pharmaceutical formulations because they can be immunogenic. Pinckard et al. 2 331 340 1967 Robbins et al. 36 838 845 1987 Cleland et al. 10 307 377 1993 .

The replacement of amino acids can also change the selectivity of binding to cell surface receptors. Ostade et al. 361 266 268 1993 describes certain mutations resulting in selective binding of TNF to only one of the two known types of TNF receptors. Thus the DR3 V1 or DR3 receptor of the present invention may include one or more amino acid substitutions deletions or additions either from natural mutations or human manipulation.

As indicated changes are preferably of a minor nature such as conservative amino acid substitutions that do not significantly affect the folding or activity of the protein see Table 1 .

Of course the number of amino acid substitutions a skilled artisan would make depends on many factors including those described above. Generally speaking the number of substitutions for any given DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptide will not be more than 50 40 30 25 20 15 10 5 or 3.

Amino acids in the DR3 V1 or DR3 protein of the present invention that are essential for function can be identified by methods known in the art such as site directed mutagenesis or alanine scanning mutagenesis Cunningham and Wells 244 1081 1085 1989 . The latter procedure introduces single alanine mutations at every residue in the molecule. The resulting mutant molecules are then tested for biological activity such as receptor binding or in vitro or in vitro proliferative activity. Sites that are critical for ligand receptor binding can also be determined by structural analysis such as crystallization nuclear magnetic resonance or photoaffinity labeling Smith et al. 224 899 904 1992 and de Vos et al. 255 306 312 1992 .

The polypeptides of the present invention are preferably provided in an isolated form and preferably are substantially purified. A recombinantly produced version of the DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptide is substantially purified by the one step method described in Smith and Johnson 67 31 40 1988 .

The polypeptides of the present invention also include the polypeptide encoded by the deposited cDNAs including the leader the mature polypeptide encoded by the deposited the cDNAs minus the leader i.e. the mature protein the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO 2 or SEQ ID NO 4 including the leader the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO 2 or SEQ ID NO 4 minus the leader the extracellular domain the transmembrane domain the intracellular domain soluble polypeptides comprising or alternatively consisting of all or part of the extracellular and intracellular domains but lacking the transmembrane domain as well as polypeptides which are at least 80 identical more preferably at least 80 or 85 identical still more preferably at least 90 92 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to the polypeptide encoded by the deposited cDNAs to the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO 2 or SEQ ID NO 4 and also include portions of such polypeptides with at least 30 amino acids and more preferably at least 50 amino acids. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.

By a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least for example 95 identical to a reference amino acid sequence of a DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptide is intended that the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide is identical to the reference sequence except that the polypeptide sequence may include up to five amino acid alterations per each 100 amino acids of the reference amino acid of a DR3 V1 or DR3. In other words to obtain a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least 95 identical to a reference amino acid sequence up to 5 of the amino acid residues in the reference sequence may be deleted or substituted with another amino acid or a number of amino acids up to 5 of the total amino acid residues in the reference sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence. These alterations of the reference sequence may occur at the amino or carboxy terminal positions of the reference amino acid sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions interspersed either individually among residues in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence.

As a practical matter whether any particular polypeptide is at least 80 85 90 92 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to for instance the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 2 or SEQ ID NO 4 the amino acid sequence encoded by the deposited cDNAs or fragments thereof can be determined conventionally using known computer programs such as the Bestfit program Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package Version 8 for Unix Genetics Computer Group University Research Park 575 Science Drive Madison Wis. 53711 . When using Bestfit or any other sequence alignment program to determine whether a particular sequence is for instance 95 identical to a reference sequence according to the present invention the parameters are set of course such that the percentage of identity is calculated over the full length of the reference amino acid sequence and that gaps in homology of up to 5 of the total number of amino acid residues in the reference sequence are allowed.

In a specific embodiment the identity between a reference query sequence a sequence of the present invention and a subject sequence also referred to as a global sequence alignment is determined using the FASTDB computer program based on the algorithm of Brutlag et al. Comp. App. Biosci. 6 237 245 1990 . Preferred parameters used in a FASTDB amino acid alignment are Matrix PAM 0 k tuple 2 Mismatch Penalty 1 Joining Penalty 20 Randomization Group Length 0 Cutoff Score 1 Window Size sequence length Gap Penalty 5 Gap Size Penalty 0.05 Window Size 500 or the length of the subject amino acid sequence whichever is shorter. According to this embodiment if the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence due to N or C terminal deletions not because of internal deletions a manual correction is made to the results to take into consideration the fact that the FASTDB program does not account for N and C terminal truncations of the subject sequence when calculating global percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the N and C termini relative to the query sequence the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of residues of the query sequence that are N and C terminal of the subject sequence which are not matched aligned with a corresponding subject residue as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. A determination of whether a residue is matched aligned is determined by results of the FASTDB sequence alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity calculated by the above FASTDB program using the specified parameters to arrive at a final percent identity score. This final percent identity score is what is used for the purposes of this embodiment. Only residues to the N and C termini of the subject sequence which are not matched aligned with the query sequence are considered for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score. That is only query residue positions outside the farthest N and C terminal residues of the subject sequence. For example a 90 amino acid residue subject sequence is aligned with a 100 residue query sequence to determine percent identity. The deletion occurs at the N terminus of the subject sequence and therefore the FASTDB alignment does not show a matching alignment of the first 10 residues at the N terminus. The 10 unpaired residues represent 10 of the sequence number of residues at the N and C termini not matched total number of residues in the query sequence so 10 is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the FASTDB program. If the remaining 90 residues were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90 . In another example a 90 residue subject sequence is compared with a 100 residue query sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so there are no residues at the N or C termini of the subject sequence which are not matched aligned with the query. In this case the percent identity calculated by FASTDB is not manually corrected. Once again only residue positions outside the N and C terminal ends of the subject sequence as displayed in the FASTDB alignment which are not matched aligned with the query sequence are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are made for the purposes of this embodiment.

The present inventors have discovered that the DR3 V1 polypeptide is a 428 residue protein exhibiting three main structural domains. First the ligand binding domain was identified within amino acid residues from about 36 to about 212 in SEQ ID NO 2. Second the transmembrane domain was identified within amino acid residues from about 213 to about 235 in SEQ ID NO 2. Third the intracellular domain was identified within amino acid residues from about 236 to about 428 in SEQ ID NO 2. Importantly the intracellular domain includes a death domain at amino acid residues from about 353 to about 419. Further preferred fragments of the polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO 2 include the mature protein from amino acid residues about 36 to about 428 and soluble polypeptides comprising or alternatively consisting of all or part of the extracellular and intracellular domains but lacking the transmembrane domain. In this context about includes the particularly recited value and values larger or smaller by several 5 4 3 2 or 1 amino acids. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.

The invention also provides polypeptides comprising or alternatively consisting of one two three four five or more amino acid sequences selected from the group consisting of amino acid residues from about 1 to about 215 of SEQ ID NO 2 amino acid residues from about 30 to about 215 of SEQ ID NO 2 amino acid residues from about 215 to about 240 of SEQ ID NO 2 amino acid residues from about 240 to about 428 of SEQ ID NO 2 and amino acid residues from about 350 to about 420 of SEQ ID NO 2. In this context about includes the particularly recited value and values larger or smaller by several 5 4 3 2 or 1 amino acids. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.

The present inventors have also discovered that the DR3 polypeptide is a 417 residue protein exhibiting three main structural domains. First the ligand binding domain was identified within amino acid residues from about 25 to about 201 in SEQ ID NO 4. Second the transmembrane domain was identified within amino acid residues from about 202 to about 224 in SEQ ID NO 4. Third the intracellular domain was identified within amino acid residues from about 225 to about 417 in SEQ ID NO 4. Importantly the intracellular domain includes a death domain at amino acid residues from about 342 to about 408. Further preferred fragments of the polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO 4 include the mature protein from amino acid residues about 25 to about 417 and soluble polypeptides comprising or alternatively consisting of all or part of the extracellular and intracellular domains but lacking the transmembrane domain. In this context about includes the particularly recited value and values larger or smaller by several 5 4 3 2 or 1 amino acids. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.

As one of skill in the art will recognize the full length polypeptides encoded by the DR3 V1 and DR3 cDNA differ only in the amino acid sequence of the leader peptide. The first 24 amino acids of the polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO 2 are replaced by the first 13 amino acids shown in SEQ ID NO 4 but the rest of the amino acid sequence is the same. Thus both the DR3 V1 cDNA and DR3 cDNA encode an identical mature protein having the same biological activity.

Thus the invention further provides DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptides encoded by the deposited cDNAs including the leader and DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptide fragments selected from the mature protein the extracellular domain the transmembrane domain the intracellular domain and the death domain.

The polypeptides of the present invention have uses which include but are not limited to as sources for generating antibodies that bind the polypeptides of the invention and as molecular weight markers on SDS PAGE gels or on molecular sieve gel filtration columns using methods well known to those of skill in the art.

In another aspect the invention provides a peptide or polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of an epitope bearing portion of a polypeptide described herein.

Antigenic epitope bearing peptides and polypeptides of the invention are therefore useful to raise antibodies including monoclonal antibodies that bind specifically to a polypeptide of the invention. See for instance Wilson et al. 37 767 778 1984 at 777.

Antigenic epitope bearing peptides and polypeptides of the invention preferably contain a sequence of at least seven more preferably at least nine and most preferably between at least about 15 to about 30 amino acids contained within the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide of the invention. In this context about includes the particularly recited value and values larger or smaller by several 5 4 3 2 or 1 amino acids. Polynucleotides encoding these antigenic epitope bearing peptides are also encompassed by the invention.

Non limiting examples of antigenic polypeptides or peptides that can be used to generate DR3 specific antibodies include a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues from about 1 to about 22 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of one two three four five or more amino acid sequences selected from the group consisting of amino acid residues from about 33 to about 56 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues from about 59 to about 82 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues from about 95 to about 112 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues from about 122 to about 133 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues from about 161 to about 177 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues from about 179 to about 190 in SEQ ID NO 2 and a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues from about 196 to about 205 in SEQ ID NO 2. In this context about includes the particularly recited value and values larger or smaller by several 5 4 3 2 or 1 amino acids. Polynucleotides encoding these antigenic epitope bearing peptides are also encompassed by the invention. In addition antigenic polypeptides or peptides include polypeptides comprising or alternatively consisting of the amino acid residues that are the corresponding residues to those polypeptides of DR3 V1 disclosed above. As indicated above the inventors have determined that the above polypeptide fragments are antigenic regions of the DR3 V1 and DR3 protein.

The epitope bearing peptides and polypeptides of the invention may be produced by any conventional means. R. A. Houghten General method for the rapid solid phase synthesis of large numbers of peptides specificity of antigen antibody interaction at the level of individual amino acids 82 5131 5135 1985 . This Simultaneous Multiple Peptide Synthesis SMPS process is further described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 631 211 to Houghten et al. 1986 .

As one of skill in the art will appreciate DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptides of the present invention and the epitope bearing fragments thereof described above can be combined with parts of the constant domain of immunoglobulins IgG resulting in chimeric polypeptides. These fusion proteins facilitate purification and show an increased half life in vivo. This has been shown e.g. for chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4 polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins EPA 394 827 Traunecker et al. 331 84 86 1988 . Fusion proteins that have a disulfide linked dimeric structure due to the IgG part can also be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules than the monomeric DR3 V1 or DR3 protein or protein fragment alone Fountoulakis et al. 270 3958 3964 1995 .

The present invention thus encompasses polypeptides comprising or alternatively consisting of an epitope of the polypeptide having an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 2 or SEQ ID NO 4 or an epitope of the polypeptide sequence encoded by a polynucleotide sequence contained in the plasmid deposited as ATCC Deposit No. 97456 or 97757 or encoded by a polynucleotide that hybridizes to the complement of the sequence of SEQ ID NO 1 or SEQ ID NO 3 or contained in the plasmid deposited as ATCC Deposit No. 97456 or 97757 under stringent hybridization conditions or lower stringency hybridization conditions as defined supra. The present invention further encompasses polynucleotide sequences encoding an epitope of a polypeptide sequence of the invention such as for example the sequence disclosed in SEQ ID NO 1 or SEQ ID NO 3 polynucleotide sequences of the complementary strand of a polynucleotide sequence encoding an epitope of the invention and polynucleotide sequences which hybridize to the complementary strand under stringent hybridization conditions or lower stringency hybridization conditions defined supra. Polynucleotides encoding these antigenic epitope bearing peptides are also encompassed by the invention.

The term epitopes as used herein refers to portions of a polypeptide having antigenic or immunogenic activity in an animal preferably a mammal and most preferably in a human. In a preferred embodiment the present invention encompasses a polypeptide comprising an epitope as well as the polynucleotide encoding this polypeptide. An immunogenic epitope as used herein is defined as a portion of a protein that elicits an antibody response in an animal as determined by any method known in the art for example by the methods for generating antibodies described infra. See for example Geysen et al. 81 3998 4002 1983 . The term antigenic epitope as used herein is defined as a portion of a protein to which an antibody can immunospecifically bind its antigen as determined by any method well known in the art for example by the immunoassays described herein. Immunospecific binding excludes non specific binding but does not necessarily exclude cross reactivity with other antigens. Antigenic epitopes need not necessarily be immunogenic.

As to the selection of peptides or polypeptides bearing an antigenic epitope i.e. that contain a region of a protein molecule to which an antibody can bind it is well known in that art that relatively short synthetic peptides that mimic part of a protein sequence are routinely capable of eliciting an antiserum that reacts with the partially mimicked protein. See for instance J. G. Sutcliffe et al. Antibodies that react with predetermined sites on proteins 219 660 666 1983 . Peptides capable of eliciting protein reactive sera are frequently represented in the primary sequence of a protein can be characterized by a set of simple chemical rules and are confined neither to immunodominant regions of intact proteins i.e. immunogenic epitopes nor to the amino or carboxyl terminals.

Fragments that function as epitopes may be produced by any conventional means. See e.g. Houghten 82 5131 5135 1985 further described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 631 211 .

In the present invention antigenic epitopes preferably contain a sequence of at least 4 at least 5 at least 6 at least 7 more preferably at least 8 at least 9 at least 10 at least 15 at least 20 at least 25 and most preferably between about 15 to about 30 amino acids. Preferred polypeptides comprising immunogenic or antigenic epitopes are at least 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 or 100 amino acid residues in length. Antigenic epitopes are useful for example to raise antibodies including monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind the epitope. Antigenic epitopes can be used as the target molecules in immunoassays. See for instance Wilson et al. 37 767 778 1984 Sutcliffe et al. 219 660 666 1983 .

Similarly immunogenic epitopes can be used for example to induce antibodies according to methods well known in the art. See for instance Sutcliffe et al. supra Wilson et al. supra Chow et al. 82 910 914 and Bittle et al. 66 2347 2354 1985 . The polypeptides comprising one or more immunogenic epitopes may be presented for eliciting an antibody response together with a carrier protein such as an albumin to an animal system such as for example rabbit or mouse or if the polypeptide is of sufficient length at least about 25 amino acids the polypeptide may be presented without a carrier. However immunogenic epitopes comprising as few as 8 to 10 amino acids have been shown to be sufficient to raise antibodies capable of binding to at the very least linear epitopes in a denatured polypeptide e.g. in Western blotting .

Epitope bearing polypeptides of the present invention may be used to induce antibodies according to methods well known in the art including but not limited to in vivo immunization in vitro immunization and phage display methods. See e.g. Sutcliffe et al. supra Wilson et al. supra and Bittle et al. supra. If in vivo immunization is used animals may be immunized with free peptide however anti peptide antibody titer may be boosted by coupling the peptide to a macromolecular carrier such as keyhole limpet hemacyanin KLH or tetanus toxoid. For instance peptides containing cysteine residues may be coupled to a carrier using a linker such as maleimidobenzoyl N hydroxysuccinimide ester MBS while other peptides may be coupled to carriers using a more general linking agent such as glutaraldehyde. Animals such as for example rabbits rats and mice are immunized with either free or carrier coupled peptides for instance by intraperitoneal and or intradermal injection of emulsions containing about 100 micrograms of peptide or carrier protein and Freund s adjuvant or any other adjuvant known for stimulating an immune response. Several booster injections may be needed for instance at intervals of about two weeks to provide a useful titer of anti peptide antibody that can be detected for example by ELISA assay using free peptide adsorbed to a solid surface. The titer of anti peptide antibodies in serum from an immunized animal may be increased by selection of anti peptide antibodies for instance by adsorption to the peptide on a solid support and elution of the selected antibodies according to methods well known in the art.

As one of skill in the art will appreciate and as discussed above the polypeptides of the present invention comprising an immunogenic or antigenic epitope can be fused to other polypeptide sequences. For example the polypeptides of the present invention may be fused with the constant domain of immunoglobulins IgA IgE IgG IgM or portions thereof CH1 CH2 CH3 or any combination thereof and portions thereof resulting in chimeric polypeptides. Such fusion proteins may facilitate purification and may increase half life in vivo. This has been shown for chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4 polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins. See e.g. EP 394 827 Traunecker et al. 331 84 86 1988 . IgG Fusion proteins that have a disulfide linked dimeric structure due to the IgG portion disulfide bonds have also been found to be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules than monomeric polypeptides or fragments thereof alone. See e.g. Fountoulakis et al. 270 3958 3964 1995 . Nucleic acids encoding the above epitopes can also be recombined with a gene of interest as an epitope tag e.g. the hemagglutinin HA tag or flag tag to aid in detection and purification of the expressed polypeptide. For example a system described by Janknecht et al. allows for the ready purification of non denatured fusion proteins expressed in human cell lines Janknecht et al. 199188 8972 897 . In this system the gene of interest is subcloned into a vaccinia recombination plasmid such that the open reading frame of the gene is translationally fused to an amino terminal tag consisting of six histidine residues. The tag serves as a matrix binding domain for the fusion protein. Extracts from cells infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus are loaded onto Ni nitriloacetic acid agarose column and histidine tagged proteins can be selectively eluted with imidazole containing buffers.

Polypeptides of the invention including antibodies of the invention see below may also be fused to albumin including but not limited to recombinant human serum albumin see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 876 969 issued Mar. 2 1999 EP Patent 0 413 622 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 766 883 issued Jun. 16 1998 herein incorporated by reference in their entirety resulting in chimeric polypeptides. In a preferred embodiment polypeptides including antibodies of the present invention including fragments or variants thereof are fused with the mature form of human serum albumin i.e. amino acids 1 585 of human serum albumin as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 of EP Patent 0 322 094 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . In another preferred embodiment polypeptides and or antibodies of the present invention including fragments or variants thereof are fused with polypeptide fragments comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues 1 z of human serum albumin where z is an integer from 369 to 419 as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 766 883 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Polypeptides and or antibodies of the present invention including fragments or variants thereof may be fused to either the N or C terminal end of the heterologous protein e.g. immunoglobulin Fc polypeptide or human serum albumin polypeptide . Such human serum albumin DR3 and or DR3 V1 fusion proteins may be used therapeutically in accordance with the invention in the same manner as for example the DR3 and or DR3 V1 Fc fusion proteins described herein.

Additional fusion proteins of the invention may be generated through the techniques of gene shuffling motif shuffling exon shuffling and or codon shuffling collectively referred to as DNA shuffling . DNA shuffling may be employed to modulate the activities of polypeptides of the invention such methods can be used to generate polypeptides with altered activity as well as agonists and antagonists of the polypeptides. See generally U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 605 793 5 811 238 5 830 721 5 834 252 and 5 837 458 and Patten et al. 8 724 33 1997 Harayama 16 2 76 82 1998 Hansson et al. 287 265 76 1999 and Lorenzo and Blasco 24 2 308 13 1998 each of these patents and publications are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety . In one embodiment alteration of polynucleotides corresponding to SEQ ID NO 1 or SEQ ID NO 3 and the polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides may be achieved by DNA shuffling. DNA shuffling involves the assembly of two or more DNA segments by homologous or site specific recombination to generate variation in the polynucleotide sequence. In another embodiment polynucleotides of the invention or the encoded polypeptides may be altered by being subjected to random mutagenesis by error prone PCR random nucleotide insertion or other methods prior to recombination. In another embodiment one or more components motifs sections parts domains fragments etc. of a polynucleotide coding a polypeptide of the invention may be recombined with one or more components motifs sections parts domains fragments etc. of one or more heterologous molecules.

As mentioned above even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the N terminus of a protein results in modification of loss of one or more biological functions of the protein other functional activities e.g. biological activities ability to multimerize ability to bind DR3 V1 ligand may still be retained. For example the ability of shortened DR3 V1 muteins to induce and or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptides generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the N terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that an DR3 V1 mutein with a large number of deleted N terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact peptides composed of as few as six DR3 V1 amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.

Accordingly the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the amino terminus of the DR3 V1 amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 2 up to the arginine residue at position number 423 and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular the present invention provides polypeptides comprising or alternatively consisting of the amino acid sequence of residues n1 428 of SEQ ID NO 2 where n1 is an integer from 2 to 423 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in SEQ ID NO 2. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.

More in particular the invention provides polynucleotides encoding polypeptides comprising or alternatively consisting of the amino acid sequence of a member selected from the group consisting of amino acid residues E 2 to P 428 E 3 to P 428 T 4 to P 428 Q 5 to P 428 Q 6 to P 428 G 7 to P 428 E 8 to P 428 A 9 to P 428 P 10 to P 428 R 11 to P 428 G 12 to P 428 Q 13 to P 428 L 14 to P 428 R 15

421 to P 428 S 422 to P 428 and R 423 to P 428 of the DR3 V1 sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 2. The present invention is also directed to nucleic acid molecules comprising or alternatively consisting of a polynucleotide sequence at least 80 85 90 92 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to the polynucleotide sequences encoding the polypeptides described above. The present invention also encompasses the above polynucleotide sequences fused to a heterologous polynucleotide sequence. Polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides are also encompassed by the invention.

Also as mentioned above even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the C terminus of a protein results in modification of loss of one or more biological functions of the protein other functional activities e.g. biological activities ability to multimerize ability to bind DR3 V1 ligand may still be retained. For example the ability of the shortened DR3 V1 mutein to induce and or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptide generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the C terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking C terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that an DR3 V1 mutein with a large number of deleted C terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact peptides composed of as few as six DR3 V1 amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.

Accordingly the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the carboxy terminus of the amino acid sequence of the DR3 V1 polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO 2 up to the glutamine residue at position number 6 and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular the present invention provides polypeptides comprising or alternatively consisting of the amino acid sequence of residues 1 ml of SEQ ID NO 2 where m1 is an integer from 6 to 427 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in SEQ ID NO 2. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.

M 1 to Q 6 of the sequence of the DR3 V1 sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 2. The present invention is also directed to nucleic acid molecules comprising or alternatively consisting of a polynucleotide sequence at least 80 85 90 92 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to the polynucleotide sequences encoding the polypeptides described above. The present invention also encompasses the above polynucleotide sequences fused to a heterologous polynucleotide sequence. Polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides are also encompassed by the invention.

The invention also provides polypeptides having one or more amino acids deleted from both the amino and the carboxyl termini of an DR3 V1 polypeptide which may be described generally as having residues n1 m1 of SEQ ID NO 2 where n1 and m1 are integers as described above. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.

As mentioned above even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the N terminus of an extracellular domain of a protein results in modification of loss of one or more biological functions of the protein other functional activities e.g. biological activities ability to multimerize ability to bind DR3 V1 ligand may still be retained. For example the ability of shortened DR3 V1 extracellular domain muteins to induce and or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete mature or extracellular domain forms of the polypeptides generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete mature or extracellular domain polypeptide are removed from the N terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N terminal residues of an extracellular domain of a polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a DR3 V1 extracellular domain mutein with a large number of deleted N terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact peptides composed of as few as six DR3 V1 extracellular domain amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.

Accordingly the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the amino terminus of the DR3 V1 extracellular domain amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 2 up to the cysteine residue at position number 206 and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular the present invention provides polypeptides comprising or alternatively consisting of the amino acid sequence of residues n2 212 of SEQ ID NO 2 where n2 is an integer from 36 to 206 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in SEQ ID NO 2. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.

The present invention is also directed to nucleic acid molecules comprising or alternatively consisting of a polynucleotide sequence at least 80 85 90 92 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to the polynucleotide sequences encoding the polypeptides described above.

Also as mentioned above even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the C terminus of an extracellular domain of a protein results in modification of loss of one or more biological functions of the protein other functional activities e.g. biological activities ability to multimerize ability to bind DR3 V1 ligand may still be retained. For example the ability of the shortened DR3 V1 extracellular domain mutein to induce and or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete mature or extracellular domain forms of the polypeptide generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete mature or extracellular domain of a polypeptide are removed from the C terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking C terminal residues of an extracellular domain of a polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a DR3 V1 extracellular domain mutein with a large number of deleted C terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact peptides composed of as few as six DR3 V1 extracellular domain amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.

Accordingly the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the carboxy terminus of the amino acid sequence of the extracellular domain of the DR3 V1 polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO 2 up to the proline residue at position number 42 and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular the present invention provides polypeptides comprising or alternatively consisting of the amino acid sequence of residues 36 m2 of SEQ ID NO 2 where m2 is an integer from 42 to 212 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in SEQ ID NO 2. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.

The present invention is also directed to nucleic acid molecules comprising or alternatively consisting of a polynucleotide sequence at least 80 85 90 92 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to the polynucleotide sequences encoding the polypeptides described above. The present invention also encompasses the above polynucleotide sequences fused to a heterologous polynucleotide sequence. Polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides are also encompassed by the invention.

Also as mentioned above even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the C terminus of a protein results in modification of loss of one or more biological functions of the protein other functional activities e.g. biological activities ability to multimerize ability to bind DR3 ligand may still be retained. For example the ability of the shortened DR3 mutein to induce and or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptide generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the C terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking C terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a DR3 mutein with a large number of deleted C terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact peptides composed of as few as six DR3 amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.

Accordingly the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the carboxy terminus of the amino acid sequence of the DR3 polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO 4 up to the arginine residue at position number 6 and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular the present invention provides polypeptides comprising or alternatively consisting of the amino acid sequence of residues 1 m3 of SEQ ID NO 4 where m3 is an integer from 6 to 416 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in SEQ ID NO 4. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.

The present invention is also directed to nucleic acid molecules comprising or alternatively consisting of a polynucleotide sequence at least 80 85 90 92 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to the polynucleotide sequences encoding the polypeptides described above. The present invention also encompasses the above polynucleotide sequences fused to a heterologous polynucleotide sequence. Polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides are also encompassed by the invention.

The invention also provides polypeptides having one or more amino acids deleted from both the amino and the carboxyl termini of an DR3 polypeptide which may be described generally as having residues n3 m3 of SEQ ID NO 4 where n3 and m3 are integers as described above. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.

As mentioned above even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the N terminus of an extracellular domain of a protein results in modification of loss of one or more biological functions of the protein other functional activities e.g. biological activities ability to multimerize ability to bind DR3 ligand may still be retained. For example the ability of shortened DR3 extracellular domain muteins to induce and or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete mature or extracellular domain forms of the polypeptides generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete mature or extracellular domain polypeptide are removed from the N terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a DR3 extracellular domain mutein with a large number of deleted N terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact peptides composed of as few as six DR3 extracellular domain amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.

Accordingly the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the amino terminus of the DR3 extracellular domain amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 4 up to the cysteine residue at position number 195 and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides.

The present invention is also directed to nucleic acid molecules comprising or alternatively consisting of a polynucleotide sequence at least 80 85 90 92 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to the polynucleotide sequences encoding the polypeptides described above. The present invention also encompasses the above polynucleotide sequences fused to a heterologous polynucleotide sequence. Polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides are also encompassed by the invention.

Also as mentioned above even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the C terminus of an extracellular domain of a protein results in modification of loss of one or more biological functions of the protein other functional activities e.g. biological activities ability to multimerize ability to bind DR3 ligand may still be retained. For example the ability of the shortened DR3 extracellular domain mutein to induce and or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptide generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the C terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking C terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a DR3 extracellular domain mutein with a large number of deleted C terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact peptides composed of as few as six DR3 extracellular domain amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.

Accordingly the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the carboxy terminus of the amino acid sequence of the DR3 extracellular domain polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO 4 up to the proline residue at position number 31 and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular the present invention provides polypeptides comprising or alternatively consisting of the amino acid sequence of residues 1 m4 of SEQ ID NO 4 where m4 is an integer from 31 to 201 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in SEQ ID NO 4. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.

In addition proteins of the invention can be chemically synthesized using techniques known in the art e.g. see Creighton 1983 Proteins Structures and Molecular Principles W. H. Freeman Co. N.Y. and Hunkapiller M. et al. 310 105 111 1984 . For example a peptide corresponding to a fragment of the DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptides of the invention can be synthesized by use of a peptide synthesizer. Furthermore if desired nonclassical amino acids or chemical amino acid analogs can be introduced as a substitution or addition into the DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptide sequence. Non classical amino acids include but are not limited to to the D isomers of the common amino acids 2 4 diaminobutyric acid amino isobutyric acid 4 aminobutyric acid Abu 2 amino butyric acid Abu Ahx 6 amino hexanoic acid Aib 2 amino isobutyric acid 3 amino propionic acid ornithine norleucine norvaline hydroxyproline sarcosine citrulline homocitrulline cysteic acid t butylglycine t butylalanine phenylglycine cyclohexylalanine alanine fluoro amino acids designer amino acids such as methyl amino acids Ca methyl amino acids Na methyl amino acids and amino acid analogs in general. Furthermore the amino acid can be D dextrorotary or L levorotary .

Non naturally occurring variants may be produced using art known mutagenesis techniques which include but are not limited to oligonucleotide mediated mutagenesis alanine scanning PCR mutagenesis site directed mutagenesis see e.g. Carter et al. 13 4331 1986 and Zoller et al. 10 6487 1982 cassette mutagenesis see e.g. Wells et al. 34 315 1985 restriction selection mutagenesis see e.g. Wells et al. 317 415 1986 .

The invention additionally encompasses DR3 V1 and DR3 polypeptides which are differentially modified during or after translation e.g. by glycosylation acetylation phosphorylation amidation derivatization by known protecting blocking groups proteolytic cleavage linkage to an antibody molecule or other cellular ligand etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications may be carried out by known techniques including but not limited to specific chemical cleavage by cyanogen bromide trypsin chymotrypsin papain V8 protease NaBH acetylation formylation oxidation reduction metabolic synthesis in the presence of tunicamycin etc.

Additional post translational modifications encompassed by the invention include for example e.g. N linked or O linked carbohydrate chains processing of N terminal or C terminal ends attachment of chemical moieties to the amino acid backbone chemical modifications of N linked or O linked carbohydrate chains and addition or deletion of an N terminal methionine residue as a result of procaryotic host cell expression. The polypeptides may also be modified with a detectable label such as an enzymatic fluorescent isotopic or affinity label to allow for detection and isolation of the protein.

Also provided by the invention are chemically modified derivatives of DR3 V1 or DR3 which may provide additional advantages such as increased solubility stability and circulating time of the polypeptide or decreased immunogenicity see U.S. Pat. No. 4 179 337 . The chemical moieties for derivation may be selected from water soluble polymers such as polyethylene glycol ethylene glycol propylene glycol copolymers carboxymethylcellulose dextran polyvinyl alcohol and the like. The polypeptides may be modified at random positions within the molecule or at predetermined positions within the molecule and may include one two three or more attached chemical moieties.

The polymer may be of any molecular weight and may be branched or unbranched. For polyethylene glycol the preferred molecular weight is between about 1 kDa and about 100 kDa the term about indicating that in preparations of polyethylene glycol some molecules will weigh more some less than the stated molecular weight for ease in handling and manufacturing. Other sizes may be used depending on the desired therapeutic profile e.g. the duration of sustained release desired the effects if any on biological activity the ease in handling the degree or lack of antigenicity and other known effects of the polyethylene glycol to a therapeutic protein or analog . For example the polyethylene glycol may have an average molecular weight of about 200 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000 5500 6000 6500 7000 7500 8000 8500 9000 9500 10 000 10 500 11 000 11 500 12 000 12 500 13 000 13 500 14 000 14 500 15 000 15 500 16 000 16 500 17 000 17 500 18 000 18 500 19 000 19 500 20 000 25 000 30 000 35 000 40 000 50 000 55 000 60 000 65 000 70 000 75 000 80 000 85 000 90 000 95 000 or 100 000 kDa.

As noted above the polyethylene glycol may have a branched structure. Branched polyethylene glycols are described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 643 575 Morpurgo et al. 56 59 72 1996 Vorobjev et al. 18 2745 2750 1999 and Caliceti et al. 10 638 646 1999 the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The polyethylene glycol molecules or other chemical moieties should be attached to the protein with consideration of effects on functional or antigenic domains of the protein. There are a number of attachment methods available to those skilled in the art e.g. EP 0 401 384 herein incorporated by reference coupling PEG to G CSF see also Malik et al. 20 1028 1035 1992 reporting pegylation of GM CSF using tresyl chloride . For example polyethylene glycol may be covalently bound through amino acid residues via a reactive group such as a free amino or carboxyl group. Reactive groups are those to which an activated polyethylene glycol molecule may be bound. The amino acid residues having a free amino group may include lysine residues and the N terminal amino acid residues those having a free carboxyl group may include aspartic acid residues glutamic acid residues and the C terminal amino acid residue. Sulfhydryl groups may also be used as a reactive group for attaching the polyethylene glycol molecules. Preferred for therapeutic purposes is attachment at an amino group such as attachment at the N terminus or lysine group.

As suggested above polyethylene glycol may be attached to proteins via linkage to any of a number of amino acid residues. For example polyethylene glycol can be linked to a protein via covalent bonds to lysine histidine aspartic acid glutamic acid or cysteine residues. One or more reaction chemistries may be employed to attach polyethylene glycol to specific amino acid residues e.g. lysine histidine aspartic acid glutamic acid or cysteine of the protein or to more than one type of amino acid residue e.g. lysine histidine aspartic acid glutamic acid cysteine and combinations thereof of the protein.

One may specifically desire proteins chemically modified at the N terminus. Using polyethylene glycol as an illustration of the present composition one may select from a variety of polyethylene glycol molecules by molecular weight branching etc. the proportion of polyethylene glycol molecules to protein or peptide molecules in the reaction mix the type of pegylation reaction to be performed and the method of obtaining the selected N terminally pegylated protein. The method of obtaining the N terminally pegylated preparation i.e. separating this moiety from other monopegylated moieties if necessary may be by purification of the N terminally pegylated material from a population of pegylated protein molecules. Selective proteins chemically modified at the N terminus modification may be accomplished by reductive alkylation which exploits differential reactivity of different types of primary amino groups lysine versus the N terminal available for derivatization in a particular protein. Under the appropriate reaction conditions substantially selective derivatization of the protein at the N terminus with a carbonyl group containing polymer is achieved.

As indicated above pegylation of the proteins of the invention may be accomplished by any number of means. For example polyethylene glycol may be attached to the protein either directly or by an intervening linker. Linkerless systems for attaching polyethylene glycol to proteins are described in Delgado et al. 9 249 304 1992 Francis et al. 68 1 18 1998 U.S. Pat. No. 4 002 531 U.S. Pat. No. 5 349 052 WO 95 06058 and WO 98 32466 the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.

One system for attaching polyethylene glycol directly to amino acid residues of proteins without an intervening linker employs tresylated MPEG which is produced by the modification of monmethoxy polyethylene glycol MPEG using tresylchloride ClSOCHCF . Upon reaction of protein with tresylated MPEG polyethylene glycol is directly attached to amine groups of the protein. Thus the invention includes protein polyethylene glycol conjugates produced by reacting proteins of the invention with a polyethylene glycol molecule having a 2 2 2 trifluoreothane sulphonyl group.

Polyethylene glycol can also be attached to proteins using a number of different intervening linkers. For example U.S. Pat. No. 5 612 460 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference discloses urethane linkers for connecting polyethylene glycol to proteins. Protein polyethylene glycol conjugates wherein the polyethylene glycol is attached to the protein by a linker can also be produced by reaction of proteins with compounds such as MPEG succinimidylsuccinate MPEG activated with 1 1 carbonyldiimidazole MPEG 2 4 5 trichloropenylcarbonate MPEG p nitrophenolcarbonate and various MPEG succinate derivatives. A number additional polyethylene glycol derivatives and reaction chemistries for attaching polyethylene glycol to proteins are described in WO 98 32466 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Pegylated protein products produced using the reaction chemistries set out herein are included within the scope of the invention.

The number of polyethylene glycol moieties attached to each protein of the invention i.e. the degree of substitution may also vary. For example the pegylated proteins of the invention may be linked on average to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 15 17 20 or more polyethylene glycol molecules. Similarly the average degree of substitution within ranges such as 1 3 2 4 3 5 4 6 5 7 6 8 7 9 8 10 9 11 10 12 11 13 12 14 13 15 14 16 15 17 16 18 17 19 or 18 20 polyethylene glycol moieties per protein molecule. Methods for determining the degree of substitution are discussed for example in Delgado et al. 9 249 304 1992 .

The present invention also relates to diagnostic assays such as quantitative and diagnostic assays for detecting levels of DR3 V1 or DR3 protein or the soluble form thereof in cells and tissues including determination of normal and abnormal levels. Thus for instance a diagnostic assay in accordance with the invention for detecting over expression of DR3 V1 or DR3 or soluble form thereof compared to normal control tissue samples may be used to detect the presence of tumors for example. Assay techniques that can be used to determine levels of a protein such as an DR3 protein of the present invention or a soluble form thereof in a sample derived from a host are well known to those of skill in the art. Such assay methods include radioimmunoassays competitive binding assays Western Blot analysis and ELISA assays.

Assaying DR3 V1 or DR3 protein levels in a biological sample can occur using any art known method. Preferred for assaying DR3 V1 or DR3 protein levels in a biological sample are antibody based techniques. For example DR3 V1 or DR3 protein expression in tissues can be studied with classical immunohistological methods. M. Jalkanen et al. 101 976 985 1985 M. Jalkanen et al. 105 3087 3096 1987 .

Nos. 4 474 893 4 714 681 4 925 648 5 573 920 5 601 819 Kostelny et al. 148 1547 1553 1992 .

Antibodies of the present invention may act as agonists or antagonists of the polypeptides of the present invention. For example the present invention includes antibodies which disrupt the receptor ligand interactions with the polypeptides of the invention either partially or fully. The invention features both receptor specific antibodies and ligand specific antibodies. The invention also features receptor specific antibodies which do not prevent ligand binding but prevent receptor activation. Receptor activation i.e. signaling may be determined by techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art. For example receptor activation can be determined by detecting the phosphorylation e.g. tyrosine or serine threonine of the receptor or its substrate by immunoprecipitation followed by western blot analysis for example as described supra .

Further included in the invention are antibodies which activate the receptor. These antibodies may act as receptor agonists i.e. potentiate or activate either all or a subset of the biological activities of the ligand mediated receptor activation.

Antibodies of the present invention may be used for example but not limited to to purify detect and target the polypeptides of the present invention including both in vitro and in vivo diagnostic and therapeutic methods. For example the antibodies have use in immunoassays for qualitatively and quantitatively measuring levels of the polypeptides of the present invention in biological samples. See e.g. Harlow et al. Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 2nd ed. 1988 incorporated by reference herein in its entirety .

As discussed in more detail below the antibodies of the present invention may be used either alone or in combination with other compositions. The antibodies may further be recombinantly fused to a heterologous polypeptide at the N or C terminus or chemically conjugated including covalently and non covalently conjugations to polypeptides or other compositions. For example antibodies of the present invention may be recombinantly fused or conjugated to molecules useful as labels in detection assays and effector molecules such as heterologous polypeptides drugs or toxins. See e.g. PCT publications WO 92 08495 WO 91 14438 WO 89 12624 U.S. Pat. No. 5 314 995 and EP 396 387.

The antibodies of the invention include derivatives that are modified i.e by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule to the antibody such that covalent attachment does not prevent the antibody from generating an anti idiotypic response. For example but not by way of limitation the antibody derivatives include antibodies that have been modified e.g. by glycosylation acetylation pegylation phosphorylation amidation derivatization by known protecting blocking groups proteolytic cleavage linkage to a cellular ligand or other protein etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications may be carried out by known techniques including but not limited to specific chemical cleavage acetylation formylation metabolic synthesis of tunicamycin etc. Additionally the derivative may contain one or more non classical amino acids.

The antibodies of the present invention may be generated by any suitable method known in the art. Polyclonal antibodies to an antigen of interest can be produced by various procedures well known in the art. For example a polypeptide of the invention can be administered to various host animals including but not limited to rabbits mice rats etc. to induce the production of sera containing polyclonal antibodies specific for the antigen. Various adjuvants may be used to increase the immunological response depending on the host species and include but are not limited to Freund s complete and incomplete mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide surface active substances such as lysolecithin pluronic polyols polyanions peptides oil emulsions keyhole limpet hemocyanins dinitrophenol and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG bacille Calmette Guerin and . Such adjuvants are also well known in the art.

Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using a wide variety of techniques known in the art including the use of hybridoma recombinant and phage display technologies or a combination thereof. For example monoclonal antibodies can be produced using hybridoma techniques including those known in the art and taught for example in Harlow et al. Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 2nd ed. 1988 Hammerling et al. in Monoclonal Antibodies and T Cell Hybridomas 563 681 Elsevier N.Y. 1981 said references incorporated by reference in their entireties . The term monoclonal antibody as used herein is not limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology. The term monoclonal antibody refers to an antibody that is derived from a single clone including any eukaryotic prokaryotic or phage clone and not the method by which it is produced. Thus the term monoclonal antibody is not limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology. Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using a wide variety of techniques known in the art including the use of hybridoma and recombinant and phage display technology.

Methods for producing and screening for specific antibodies using hybridoma technology are routine and well known in the art and are discussed in detail in Example 8. Briefly mice can be immunized with a polypeptide of the invention or a cell expressing such peptide. Once an immune response is detected e.g. antibodies specific for the antigen are detected in the mouse serum the mouse spleen is harvested and splenocytes isolated. The splenocytes are then fused by well known techniques to any suitable myeloma cells for example cells from cell line SP20 available from the ATCC . Hybridomas are selected and cloned by limited dilution. The hybridoma clones are then assayed by methods known in the art for cells that secrete antibodies capable of binding a polypeptide of the invention. Ascites fluid which generally contains high levels of antibodies can be generated by immunizing mice with positive hybridoma clones.

Accordingly the present invention provides methods of generating monoclonal antibodies as well as antibodies produced by the method comprising culturing a hybridoma cell secreting an antibody of the invention wherein preferably the hybridoma is generated by fusing splenocytes isolated from a mouse immunized with an antigen of the invention with myeloma cells and then screening the hybridomas resulting from the fusion for hybridoma clones that secrete an antibody able to bind a polypeptide of the invention.

Antibody fragments that recognize specific epitopes may be generated by known techniques. For example Fab and F ab 2 fragments of the invention may be produced by proteolytic cleavage of immunoglobulin molecules using enzymes such as papain to produce Fab fragments or pepsin to produce F ab 2 fragments . F ab 2 fragments contain the variable region the light chain constant region and the CH1 domain of the heavy chain.

For example the antibodies of the present invention can also be generated using various phage display methods known in the art. In phage display methods functional antibody domains are displayed on the surface of phage particles which carry the polynucleotide sequences encoding them. In a particular such phage can be utilized to display antigen binding domains expressed from a repertoire or combinatorial antibody library e.g. human or murine . Phage expressing an antigen binding domain that binds the antigen of interest can be selected or identified with antigen e.g. using labeled antigen or antigen bound or captured to a solid surface or bead. Phage used in these methods are typically filamentous phage including fd and M13 binding domains expressed from phage with Fab Fv or disulfide stabilized Fv antibody domains recombinantly fused to either the phage gene III or gene VIII protein. Examples of phage display methods that can be used to make the antibodies of the present invention include those disclosed in Brinkman et al. 182 41 50 1995 Ames et al. 184 177 186 1995 Kettleborough et al. 24 952 958 1994 Persic et al. 187 9 18 1997 Burton et al. 57 191 280 1994 PCT application No. PCT GB91 01134 PCT publications WO 90 02809 WO 91 10737 WO 92 01047 WO 92 18619 WO 93 11236 WO 95 15982 WO 95 20401 and U.S. Pat.

As described in the above references after phage selection the antibody coding regions from the phage can be isolated and used to generate whole antibodies including human antibodies or any other desired antigen binding fragment and expressed in any desired host including mammalian cells insect cells plant cells yeast and bacteria e.g. as described in detail below. For example techniques to recombinantly produce Fab Fab and F ab 2 fragments can also be employed using methods known in the art such as those disclosed in PCT publication WO 92 22324 Mullinax et al. 12 864 869 1992 and Sawai et al. 34 26 34 1995 and Better et al. 240 1041 1043 1998 said references incorporated by reference in their entireties .

Examples of techniques which can be used to produce single chain Fvs and antibodies include those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 946 778 and 5 258 498 Huston et al. 203 46 88 1991 Shu et al. 90 7995 7999 1993 and Skerra et al. 240 1038 1040 1988 . For some uses including in vivo use of antibodies in humans and in vitro detection assays it may be preferable to use chimeric humanized or human antibodies. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different animal species such as antibodies having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal antibody and a human immunoglobulin constant region. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. See e.g. Morrison 229 1202 1985 Oi et al. 4 214 1986 Gillies et al. 1989 25 191 202 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 807 715 4 816 567 and 4 816 397 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non human species antibody that binds the desired antigen having one or more complementarity determining regions CDRs from the non human species and framework regions from a human immunoglobulin molecule. Often framework residues in the human framework regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter preferably improve antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art e.g. by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. See e.g. Queen et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 585 089 Riechmann et al. 332 323 1988 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Antibodies can be humanized using a variety of techniques known in the art including for example CDR grafting EP 239 400 PCT publication WO 91 09967 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 225 539 5 530 101 and 5 585 089 veneering or resurfacing EP 592 106 EP 519 596 Padlan 28 4 5 489 498 1991 Studnicka et al. 7 805 814 1994 Roguska. et al.

Completely human antibodies are particularly desirable for therapeutic treatment of human patients. Human antibodies can be made by a variety of methods known in the art including phage display methods described above using antibody libraries derived from human immunoglobulin sequences. See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 444 887 and 4 716 111 and PCT publications WO 98 46645 WO 98 50433 WO 98 24893 WO 98 16654 WO 96 34096 WO 96 33735 and WO 91 10741 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Human antibodies can also be produced using transgenic mice which are incapable of expressing functional endogenous immunoglobulins but which can express human immunoglobulin genes. For example the human heavy and light chain immunoglobulin gene complexes may be introduced randomly or by homologous recombination into mouse embryonic stem cells. Alternatively the human variable region constant region and diversity region may be introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells in addition to the human heavy and light chain genes. The mouse heavy and light chain immunoglobulin genes may be rendered non functional separately or simultaneously with the introduction of human immunoglobulin loci by homologous recombination. In particular homozygous deletion of the JH region prevents endogenous antibody production. The modified embryonic stem cells are expanded and microinjected into blastocysts to produce chimeric mice. The chimeric mice are then bred to produce homozygous offspring that express human antibodies. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen e.g. all or a portion of a polypeptide of the invention. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained from the immunized transgenic mice using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus using such a technique it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG IgA IgM and IgE antibodies. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies see Lonberg and Huszar 1995 Int. Rev. Immunol. 13 65 93 . For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies see e.g. PCT publications WO 98 24893 WO 96 34096 WO 96 33735 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 413 923 5 625 126 5 633 425 5 569 825 5 661 016 5 545 806 5 814 318 and 5 939 598 which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. In addition companies such as Abgenix Inc. Freemont Calif. and GenPharm San Jose Calif. can be engaged to provide human antibodies directed against a selected antigen using technology similar to that described above.

Completely human antibodies which recognize a selected epitope can be generated using a technique referred to as guided selection. In this approach a selected non human monoclonal antibody e.g. a mouse antibody is used to guide the selection of a completely human antibody recognizing the same epitope. Jespers et al. 12 899 903 1988 .

Further antibodies to the polypeptides of the invention can in turn be utilized to generate anti idiotype antibodies that mimic polypeptides of the invention using techniques well known to those skilled in the art. See e.g. Greenspan Bona 7 437 444 1989 and Nissinoff 147 2429 2438 1991 . For example antibodies which bind to and competitively inhibit polypeptide multimerization and or binding of a polypeptide of the invention to a ligand can be used to generate anti idiotypes that mimic the polypeptide multimerization and or binding domain and as a consequence bind to and neutralize polypeptide and or its ligand. Such neutralizing anti idiotypes or Fab fragments of such anti idiotypes can be used in therapeutic regimens to neutralize polypeptide ligand. For example such anti idiotypic antibodies can be used to bind a polypeptide of the invention and or to bind its ligands receptors and thereby block its biological activity.

The invention further provides polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody of the invention and fragments thereof. The invention also encompasses polynucleotides that hybridize under stringent or lower stringency hybridization conditions e.g. as defined supra to polynucleotides that encode an antibody preferably that specifically binds to a polypeptide of the invention preferably an antibody that binds to a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 2 or 4.

The polynucleotides may be obtained and the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotides determined by any method known in the art. For example if the nucleotide sequence of the antibody is known a polynucleotide encoding the antibody may be assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides e.g. as described in Kutmeier et al. 17 242 1994 which briefly involves the synthesis of overlapping oligonucleotides containing portions of the sequence encoding the antibody annealing and ligation of those oligonucleotides and then amplification of the ligated oligonucleotides by PCR.

Alternatively a polynucleotide encoding an antibody may be generated from nucleic acid from a suitable source. If a clone containing a nucleic acid encoding a particular antibody is not available but the sequence of the antibody molecule is known a nucleic acid encoding the immunoglobulin may be obtained from a suitable source e.g. an antibody cDNA library or a cDNA library generated from or nucleic acid preferably poly A RNA isolated from any tissue or cells expressing the antibody such as hybridoma cells selected to express an antibody of the invention by PCR amplification using synthetic primers hybridizable to the 3 and 5 ends of the sequence or by cloning using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the particular gene sequence to identify e.g. a cDNA clone from a cDNA library that encodes the antibody. Amplified nucleic acids generated by PCR may then be cloned into replicable cloning vectors using any method well known in the art.

Once the nucleotide sequence and corresponding amino acid sequence of the antibody is determined the nucleotide sequence of the antibody may be manipulated using methods well known in the art for the manipulation of nucleotide sequences e.g. recombinant DNA techniques site directed mutagenesis PCR etc. see for example the techniques described in Sambrook et al. 1990 Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual 2d Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. and Ausubel et al. eds. 1998 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons NY which are both incorporated by reference herein in their entireties to generate antibodies having a different amino acid sequence for example to create amino acid substitutions deletions and or insertions.

In a specific embodiment the amino acid sequence of the heavy and or light chain variable domains may be inspected to identify the sequences of the complementarity determining regions CDRs by methods that are well know in the art e.g. by comparison to known amino acid sequences of other heavy and light chain variable regions to determine the regions of sequence hypervariability. Using routine recombinant DNA techniques one or more of the CDRs may be inserted within framework regions e.g. into human framework regions to humanize a non human antibody as described supra. The framework regions may be naturally occurring or consensus framework regions and preferably human framework regions see e.g. Chothia et al. 278 457 479 1998 for a listing of human framework regions . Preferably the polynucleotide generated by the combination of the framework regions and CDRs encodes an antibody that specifically binds a polypeptide of the invention. Preferably as discussed supra one or more amino acid substitutions may be made within the framework regions and preferably the amino acid substitutions improve binding of the antibody to its antigen. Additionally such methods may be used to make amino acid substitutions or deletions of one or more variable region cysteine residues participating in an intrachain disulfide bond to generate antibody molecules lacking one or more intrachain disulfide bonds. Other alterations to the polynucleotide are encompassed by the present invention and within the skill of the art.

In addition techniques developed for the production of chimeric antibodies Morrison et al. 81 851 855 1984 Neuberger et al. 312 604 608 1984 Takeda et al. 314 452 454 1985 by splicing genes from a mouse antibody molecule of appropriate antigen specificity together with genes from a human antibody molecule of appropriate biological activity can be used. As described supra a chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from different animal species such as those having a variable region derived from a murine mAb and a human immunoglobulin constant region e.g. humanized antibodies.

Alternatively techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies U.S. Pat. No. 4 694 778 Bird 242 423 42 1988 Huston et al. 85 5879 5883 1988 and Ward et al. 334 544 554 1989 can be adapted to produce single chain antibodies. Single chain antibodies are formed by linking the heavy and light chain fragments of the Fv region via an amino acid bridge resulting in a single chain polypeptide. Techniques for the assembly of functional Fv fragments in may also be used Skerra et al. 242 1038 1041 1988 .

The antibodies of the invention can be produced by any method known in the art for the synthesis of antibodies in particular by chemical synthesis or preferably by recombinant expression techniques.

Recombinant expression of an antibody of the invention or fragment derivative or analog thereof e.g. a heavy or light chain of an antibody of the invention requires construction of an expression vector containing a polynucleotide that encodes the antibody. Once a polynucleotide encoding an antibody molecule or a heavy or light chain of an antibody or portion thereof preferably containing the heavy or light chain variable domain of the invention has been obtained the vector for the production of the antibody molecule may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Thus methods for preparing a protein by expressing a polynucleotide containing an antibody encoding nucleotide sequence are described herein. Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include for example in vitro recombinant DNA techniques synthetic techniques and in vivo genetic recombination. The invention thus provides replicable vectors comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody molecule of the invention or a heavy or light chain thereof or a heavy or light chain variable domain operably linked to a promoter. Such vectors may include the nucleotide sequence encoding the constant region of the antibody molecule see e.g. PCT Publication WO 86 05807 PCT Publication WO 89 01036 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 122 464 and the variable domain of the antibody may be cloned into such a vector for expression of the entire heavy or light chain.

The expression vector is transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce an antibody of the invention. Thus the invention includes host cells containing a polynucleotide encoding an antibody of the invention or a heavy or light chain thereof operably linked to a heterologous promoter. In preferred embodiments for the expression of double chained antibodies vectors encoding both the heavy and light chains may be co expressed in the host cell for expression of the entire immunoglobulin molecule as detailed below.

A variety of host expression vector systems may be utilized to express the antibody molecules of the invention. Such host expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of interest may be produced and subsequently purified but also represent cells which may when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences express an antibody molecule of the invention in situ. These include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria e.g. transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences yeast e.g. transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors e.g. baculovirus containing antibody coding sequences plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors e.g. cauliflower mosaic virus CaMV tobacco mosaic virus TMV or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors e.g. Ti plasmid containing antibody coding sequences or mammalian cell systems e.g. COS CHO BHK 293 3T3 cells harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells e.g. metallothionein promoter or from mammalian viruses e.g. the adenovirus late promoter the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter . Preferably bacterial cells such as and more preferably eukaryotic cells especially for the expression of whole recombinant antibody molecule are used for the expression of a recombinant antibody molecule. For example mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells CHO in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for antibodies Foecking et al. 45 101 1986 Cockett et al. 8 2 1990 .

In bacterial systems a number of expression vectors may be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the antibody molecule being expressed. For example when a large quantity of such a protein is to be produced for the generation of pharmaceutical compositions of an antibody molecule vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified may be desirable. Such vectors include but are not limited to the expression vector pUR278 Ruther et al. 2 1791 1983 in which the antibody coding sequence may be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a fusion protein is produced pIN vectors Inouye Inouye 13 3101 3109 1985 Van Heeke Schuster 24 5503 5509 1989 and the like. pGEX vectors may also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione S transferase GST . In general such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to a matrix glutathione agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.

In an insect system nuclear polyhedrosis virus AcNPV is used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in cells. The antibody coding sequence may be cloned individually into non essential regions for example the polyhedrin gene of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter for example the polyhedrin promoter .

In mammalian host cells a number of viral based expression systems may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector the antibody coding sequence of interest may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription translation control complex e.g. the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non essential region of the viral genome e.g. region E1 or E3 will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the antibody molecule in infected hosts. e.g. see Logan Shenk 81 355 359 1984 . Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements transcription terminators etc. see Bittner et al. 153 51 544 1987 .

In addition a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications e.g. glycosylation and processing e.g. cleavage of protein products may be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript glycosylation and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO VERY BHK Hela COS MDCK 293 3T3 WI38 and in particular breast cancer cell lines such as for example BT483 Hs578T HTB2 BT20 and T47D and normal mammary gland cell line such as for example CRL7030 and Hs578Bst.

For long term high yield production of recombinant proteins stable expression is preferred. For example cell lines which stably express the antibody molecule may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements e.g. promoter enhancer sequences transcription terminators polyadenylation sites etc. and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1 2 days in an enriched media and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method may advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express the antibody molecule. Such engineered cell lines may be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compounds that interact directly or indirectly with the antibody molecule.

A number of selection systems may be used including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase Wigler et al. 11 223 1977 hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase Szybalski 14 495 500 1992 and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase Lowy et al. Cell 22 817 1980 genes which can be employed in tk hgprt or aprt cells respectively. Also antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes dhfr which confers resistance to methotrexate Wigler et al. 77 3567 1980 O Hare et al. 78 1527 1981 gpt which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid Mulligan Berg 78 2072 1981 neo which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G 418 Southern P. J. et al. 1 327 341 1982 and hygro which confers resistance to hygromycin Santerre et al. 30 147 1984 . Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can be used are described in Ausubel et al. eds. 1993 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons NY Kriegler 1990 Gene Transfer and Expression A Laboratory Manual Stockton Press NY and in Chapters 12 and 13 Dracopoli et al. eds 1994 Current Protocols in Human Genetics John Wiley Sons NY. Colberre Garapin et al. 1981 J. Mol. Biol. 150 1 which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.

The expression levels of an antibody molecule can be increased by vector amplification for a review see Bebbington and Hentschel The use of vectors based on gene amplification for the expression of cloned genes in mammalian cells in DNA cloning Vol. 3. Academic Press New York 1987 . When a marker in the vector system expressing antibody is amplifiable increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the antibody gene production of the antibody will also increase Crouse et al. 3 257 1983 .

The host cell may be co transfected with two expression vectors of the invention the first vector encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding a light chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors may contain identical selectable markers which enable equal expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides. Alternatively a single vector may be used which encodes both heavy and light chain polypeptides. In such situations the light chain should be placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain Proudfoot 1986322 52 Kohler 198077 2197 . The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains may comprise cDNA or genomic DNA.

Once an antibody molecule of the invention has been recombinantly expressed it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of an immunoglobulin molecule for example by chromatography e.g. ion exchange affinity particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A and sizing column chromatography centrifugation differential solubility or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins.

The present invention encompasses antibodies recombinantly fused or chemically conjugated including both covalently and non covalently conjugations to a polypeptide or portion thereof preferably at least 10 20 or 50 amino acids of the polypeptide of the present invention to generate fusion proteins. The fusion does not necessarily need to be direct but may occur through linker sequences. The antibodies may be specific for antigens other than polypeptides or portion thereof preferably at least 10 20 or 50 amino acids of the polypeptide of the present invention. For example antibodies may be used to target the polypeptides of the present invention to particular cell types either in vitro or in vivo by fusing or conjugating the polypeptides of the present invention to antibodies specific for particular cell surface receptors. Antibodies fused or conjugated to the polypeptides of the present invention may also be used in in vitro immunoassays and purification methods using methods known in the art. See e.g. Harbor et al. supra and PCT publication WO 93 21232 EP 439 095 Naramura et al. 39 91 99 1994 U.S. Pat. No. 5 474 981 Gillies et al. 89 1428 1432 1992 Fell et al. 146 2446 2452 1991 which are incorporated by reference in their entireties.

The present invention further includes compositions comprising the polypeptides of the present invention fused or conjugated to antibody domains other than the variable regions. For example the polypeptides of the present invention may be fused or conjugated to an antibody Fc region or portion thereof. The antibody portion fused to a polypeptide of the present invention may comprise the constant region hinge region CH1 domain CH2 domain and CH3 domain or any combination of whole domains or portions thereof. The polypeptides may also be fused or conjugated to the above antibody portions to form multimers. For example Fc portions fused to the polypeptides of the present invention can form dimers through disulfide bonding between the Fc portions. Higher multimeric forms can be made by fusing the polypeptides to portions of IgA and IgM. Methods for fusing or conjugating the polypeptides of the present invention to antibody portions are known in the art. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 336 603 5 622 929 5 359 046 5 349 053 5 447 851 5 112 946 EP 307 434 EP 367 166 PCT publications WO 96 04388 WO 91 06570 Ashkenazi et al. 88 10535 10539 1991 Zheng et al. 154 5590 5600 1995 and Vil et al. 89 11337 11341 1992 said references incorporated by reference in their entireties .

As discussed supra the polypeptides of the present invention may be fused or conjugated to the above antibody portions to increase the in vivo half life of the polypeptides or for use in immunoassays using methods known in the art. Further the polypeptides of the present invention may be fused or conjugated to the above antibody portions to facilitate purification. One reported example describes chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4 polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins. EP 394 827 Traunecker et al. 331 84 86 1988 . The polypeptides of the present invention fused or conjugated to an antibody having disulfide linked dimeric structures due to the IgG may also be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules than the monomeric secreted protein or protein fragment alone. Fountoulakis et al. 270 3958 3964 1995 . In many cases the Fc part in a fusion protein is beneficial in therapy and diagnosis and thus can result in for example improved pharmacokinetic properties. EP A 232 262 . Alternatively deleting the Fc part after the fusion protein has been expressed detected and purified would be desired. For example the Fc portion may hinder therapy and diagnosis if the fusion protein is used as an antigen for immunizations. In drug discovery for example human proteins such as hIL 5 receptor have been fused with Fc portions for the purpose of high throughput screening assays to identify antagonists of hIL 5. See D. Bennett et al. 8 52 58 1995 K. Johanson et al. 270 9459 9471 1995 .

Moreover the antibodies or fragments thereof of the present invention can be fused to marker sequences such as a peptide to facilitate their purification. In preferred embodiments the marker amino acid sequence is a hexa histidine peptide such as the tag provided in a pQE vector QIAGEN Inc. 9259 Eton Avenue Chatsworth Calif. 91311 among others many of which are commercially available. As described in Gentz et al. 86 821 824 1989 for instance hexa histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. Other peptide tags useful for purification include but are not limited to the HA tag which corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein Wilson et al. 37 767 1984 and the flag tag.

The present invention further encompasses antibodies or fragments thereof conjugated to a diagnostic or therapeutic agent. The antibodies can be used diagnostically to for example monitor the development or progression of a tumor as part of a clinical testing procedure to e.g. determine the efficacy of a given treatment and or prevention regimens. Detection can be facilitated by coupling the antibody to a detectable substance. Examples of detectable substances include various enzymes prosthetic groups fluorescent materials luminescent materials bioluminescent materials radioactive materials positron emitting metals using various positron emission tomographies and nonradioactive paramagnetic metal ions. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 4 741 900 for metal ions which can be conjugated to antibodies for use as diagnostics according to the present invention. Examples of suitable enzymes include horseradish peroxidase alkaline phosphatase galactosidase or acetylcholinesterase examples of suitable prosthetic group complexes include streptavidin biotin and avidin biotin examples of suitable fluorescent materials include umbelliferone fluorescein fluorescein isothiocyanate rhodamine dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin an example of a luminescent material includes luminol examples of bioluminescent materials include luciferase luciferin and aequorin and examples of suitable radioactive material include I I In or Tc.

Further an antibody or fragment thereof may be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety such as a cytotoxin e.g. a cytostatic or cytocidal agent a therapeutic agent or a radioactive metal ion. A cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent includes any agent that is detrimental to cells. Examples include paclitaxol cytochalasin B gramicidin D ethidium bromide emetine mitomycin etoposide tenoposide vincristine vinblastine colchicin doxorubicin daunorubicin dihydroxy anthracin dione mitoxantrone mithramycin actinomycin D 1 dehydrotestosterone glucocorticoids procaine tetracaine lidocaine propranolol and puromycin and analogs or homologs thereof. Therapeutic agents include but are not limited to antimetabolites e.g. methotrexate 6 mercaptopurine 6 thioguanine cytarabine 5 fluorouracil decarbazine alkylating agents e.g. mechlorethamine thioepa chlorambucil melphalan carmustine BSNU and lomustine CCNU cyclothosphamide busulfan dibromomannitol streptozotocin mitomycin C and cis dichlorodiamine platinum II DDP cisplatin anthracyclines e.g. daunorubicin formerly daunomycin and doxorubicin antibiotics e.g. dactinomycin formerly actinomycin bleomycin mithramycin and anthramycin AMC and anti mitotic agents e.g. vincristine and vinblastine .

The conjugates of the invention can be used for modifying a given biological response the therapeutic agent or drug moiety is not to be construed as limited to classical chemical therapeutic agents. For example the drug moiety may be a protein or polypeptide possessing a desired biological activity. Such proteins may include for example a toxin such as abrin ricin A pseudomonas exotoxin or diphtheria toxin a protein such as tumor necrosis factor a interferon interferon nerve growth factor platelet derived growth factor tissue plasminogen activator a thrombotic agent or an anti angiogenic agent e.g. angiostatin or endostatin or biological response modifiers such as for example lymphokines interleukin 1 IL 1 interleukin 2 IL 2 interleukin 6 IL 6 granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor GM CSF granulocyte colony stimulating factor G CSF or other growth factors.

Antibodies may also be attached to solid supports which are particularly useful for immunoassays or purification of the target antigen. Such solid supports include but are not limited to glass cellulose polyacrylamide nylon polystyrene polyvinyl chloride or polypropylene.

Techniques for conjugating such therapeutic moiety to antibodies are well known see e.g. Arnon et al. Monoclonal Antibodies For Immunotargeting Of Drugs In Cancer Therapy in Monoclonal Antibodies And Cancer Therapy Reisfeld et al. eds. pp. 243 56 Alan R. Liss Inc. 1985 Hellstrom et al. Antibodies For Drug Delivery in Controlled Drug Delivery 2nd Ed.

Alternatively an antibody can be conjugated to a second antibody to form an antibody heteroconjugate as described by Segal in U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

An antibody with or without a therapeutic moiety conjugated to it administered alone or in combination with cytotoxic factor s and or cytokine s can be used as a therapeutic.

The antibodies of the invention may be assayed for immunospecific binding by any method known in the art. The immunoassays which can be used include but are not limited to competitive and non competitive assay systems using techniques such as western blots radioimmunoassays ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay sandwich immunoassays immunoprecipitation assays precipitin reactions gel diffusion precipitin reactions immunodiffusion assays agglutination assays complement fixation assays immunoradiometric assays fluorescent immunoassays protein A immunoassays to name but a few. Such assays are routine and well known in the art see e.g. Ausubel et al. eds 1994 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Vol. 1 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . Exemplary immunoassays are described briefly below but are not intended by way of limitation .

Immunoprecipitation protocols generally comprise lysing a population of cells in a lysis buffer such as RIPA buffer 1 NP 40 or Triton X 100 1 sodium deoxycholate 0.1 SDS 0.15 M NaCl 0.01 M sodium phosphate at pH 7.2 1 Trayslol supplemented with protein phosphatase and or protease inhibitors e.g. EDTA PMSF aprotinin sodium vanadate adding the antibody of interest to the cell lysate incubating for a period of time e.g. 1 4 hours at 4 C. adding protein A and or protein G sepharose beads to the cell lysate incubating for about an hour or more at 4 C. washing the beads in lysis buffer and resuspending the beads in SDS sample buffer. The ability of the antibody of interest to immunoprecipitate a particular antigen can be assessed by e.g. western blot analysis. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the binding of the antibody to an antigen and decrease the background e.g. pre clearing the cell lysate with sepharose beads . For further discussion regarding immunoprecipitation protocols see e.g. Ausubel et al. eds 1994 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Vol. 1 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York at 10.16.1.

Western blot analysis generally comprises preparing protein samples electrophoresis of the protein samples in a polyacrylamide gel e.g. 8 20 SDS PAGE depending on the molecular weight of the antigen transferring the protein sample from the polyacrylamide gel to a membrane such as nitrocellulose PVDF or nylon blocking the membrane in blocking solution e.g. PBS with 3 BSA or non fat milk washing the membrane in washing buffer e.g. PBS Tween 20 blocking the membrane with primary antibody the antibody of interest diluted in blocking buffer washing the membrane in washing buffer blocking the membrane with a secondary antibody which recognizes the primary antibody e.g. an anti human antibody conjugated to an enzymatic substrate e.g. horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase or radioactive molecule e.g. P or I diluted in blocking buffer washing the membrane in wash buffer and detecting the presence of the antigen. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected and to reduce the background noise. For further discussion regarding western blot protocols see e.g. Ausubel et al. eds 1994 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Vol. 1 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York at 10.8.1.

ELISAs comprise preparing antigen coating the well of a 96 well microtiter plate with the antigen adding the antibody of interest conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate e.g. horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase to the well and incubating for a period of time and detecting the presence of the antigen. In ELISAs the antibody of interest does not have to be conjugated to a detectable compound instead a second antibody which recognizes the antibody of interest conjugated to a detectable compound may be added to the well. Further instead of coating the well with the antigen the antibody may be coated to the well. In this case a second antibody conjugated to a detectable compound may be added following the addition of the antigen of interest to the coated well. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected as well as other variations of ELISAs known in the art. For further discussion regarding ELISAs see e.g. Ausubel et al. eds 1994 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Vol. 1 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York at 11.2.1.

The binding affinity of an antibody to an antigen and the off rate of an antibody antigen interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled antigen e.g. H or I with the antibody of interest in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled antigen and the detection of the antibody bound to the labeled antigen. The affinity of the antibody of interest for a particular antigen and the binding off rates can be determined from the data by scatchard plot analysis. Competition with a second antibody can also be determined using radioimmunoassays. In this case the antigen is incubated with antibody of interest is conjugated to a labeled compound e.g. H or I in the presence of increasing amounts of an unlabeled second antibody.

The present invention is further directed to antibody based therapies which involve administering antibodies of the invention to an animal preferably a mammal and most preferably a human patient for treating and or preventing one or more of the disorders or conditions described herein. Therapeutic compounds of the invention include but are not limited to antibodies of the invention including fragments analogs and derivatives thereof as described herein and nucleic acids encoding antibodies of the invention including fragments analogs and derivatives thereof as described herein .

While not intending to be bound to theory DR3 receptors are believed to induce programmed cell death by the association cross linking of death domains between different receptor molecules. Thus agents e.g. antibodies that prevent association cross linking of DR3 death domains will prevent DR3 mediated programmed cell death and agents e.g. antibodies that induce association cross linking of DR3 death domains will induce DR3 mediated programmed cell death. Further DR3 ligands e.g. TNF that induce DR3 mediated programmed cell death are believed to function by causing the association cross linking of DR3 death domains.

As suggested above DR3 receptors have been shown to bind TNF see PCT Publication No. WO 00 08139 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference . DR3 receptors are also known to be present in a number of tissues and on the surfaces of a number of cell types. These tissues and cell types include endothelial cells liver cells hepatocellular tumor lymph nodes Hodgkin s lymphoma tonsil bone marrow spleen heart thymus pericardium healing wound skin brain pancreas tumor burned skin U937 cells testis colon cancer metastasized to liver pancreas rejected kidney adipose ovary olfactory epithelium striatum depression HeLa cells LNCAP upon treatment with 30 nM androgen HUVEC human umbilical vein endothelial cells 8 week embryo tissues 9 week embryo tissues fetal brain tissues fetal kidney tissues fetal heart tissues fetal thymus tissues fetal lung tissues fetal liver tissues fetal spleen tissues T cell helper II activated T cell 16 hr activated T cell 24 hr primary dendritic cells eosinophils monocytes and keratinocytes. Further TNF has been shown to induce apoptosis to have anti angiogenic activity and to inhibit the growth of tumor cells in vivo. Additionally TNF activities are believed to be modulated at least in part through interaction with DR3 receptors.

Antibodies which act as both agonists and antagonists of receptor functions are known in the art. For example Deng et al. 92 1981 1988 1998 describe a monoclonal antibody which binds to the human c Mpl receptor and stimulates megakaryocytopoiesis. The monoclonal antibody described in Deng et al. is thus a c Mpl receptor agonist.

Antibodies which bind to DR3 receptors will have varying effects on these receptors. These effects differ based on the specific portions of the DR3 receptor to which the antibodies bind and the three dimensional conformation of the antibody molecules themselves. Thus antibodies which bind to the extracellular domain of a DR3 receptor can either stimulate or inhibit DR3 activities e.g. the induction of apoptosis . Antibodies which stimulate DR3 receptor activities e.g. by facilitating the association between DR3 receptor death domains are DR3 agonists and antibodies which inhibit DR3 receptor activities e.g. by blocking the binding of TNF and or preventing the association between DR3 receptor death domains are DR3 antagonists.

Antibodies of the invention which function as agonists and antagonists of DR3 receptors include antigen binding antibody fragments such as Fab and F ab fragments Fd single chain Fvs scFv disulfide linked Fvs sdFv and fragments comprising either a Vor Vdomain as well as polyclonal monoclonal and humanized antibodies. Each of these antigen binding antibody fragments and antibodies are described in more detail elsewhere herein.

In view of the above antibodies of the invention as well as other agonists are useful for stimulating DR3 death domain activity in endothelial cells resulting in anti angiogenic activity. Antibodies of this type are useful for prevention and or treating diseases and conditions associated with hypervascularization and neovascularization such as rheumatoid arthritis and solid tissue cancers e.g. skin cancer head and neck tumors breast tumors endothelioma osteoblastoma osteoclastoma and Kaposi s sarcoma as well as diseases and conditions associated with chronic inflammation.

Diseases and conditions associated with chronic inflammation such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn s disease often show histological changes associated with the ingrowth of new blood vessels into the inflamed tissues. Agonists of the invention which stimulate the activity of DR3 death domains will induce apoptosis in endothelial cells. As a result agonists of the invention can inhibit the formation of blood and lymph vessels and thus can be used to prevent and or treat diseases and conditions associated with hypervascularization and neovascularization.

Other diseases and conditions associated with angiogenesis which can be prevented and or treated using agonists of the invention include hypertrophic and keloid scarring proliferative diabetic retinopathy arteriovenous malformations atherosclerotic plaques hemophilic joints nonunion fractures Osler Weber syndrome psoriasis pyogenic granuloma scleroderma tracoma menorrhagia and vascular adhesions.

As noted above DR3 receptors are also found on T cells. Thus agonists of the invention e.g. anti DR3 receptor antibodies are also useful for inhibiting T cell mediated immune responses as well as preventing and or treating diseases and conditions associated with increased T cell proliferation. Diseases and conditions associated with T cell mediated immune responses and increased T cell proliferation include graft v host responses and diseases inflammation autoimmune diseases and T cell leukemias.

Further agents which inhibit DR3 death domain activity e.g. DR3 antagonists are also useful for preventing and or treating a number of diseases and conditions associated with decreased vascularization decreased T cell proliferation and decreases in T cell populations. As indicated above examples of antagonists of DR3 receptor activity include anti DR3 receptor antibodies. These antibodies can function for examples by either binding to DR3 receptors and blocking the binding of ligands which stimulate DR3 death domain activity e.g. TNF or inhibiting DR3 receptor conformational changes associated with membrane signal transduction.

An example of a condition associated with decreased vascularization that can be treated using antagonists of the invention is delayed wound healing. The elderly in particular often heal at a slower rate than younger individuals. Antagonists of the invention can thus prevent and or inhibit apoptosis from occurring in endothelial cells at wound sites and thereby promote wound healing in healing impaired individuals as well as in individuals who heal at normal rates. Thus antagonists of the invention can be used to promote and or accelerate wound healing. Antagonists of the invention are also useful for treating and or preventing other diseases and conditions including restenosis myocardial infarction peripheral arterial disease critical limb ischemia angina atherosclerosis ischemia edema liver cirrhosis osteoarthritis and pulmonary fibrosis.

Antagonists of the invention e.g. anti DR3 receptor antibodies are also useful for enhancing T cell mediated immune responses as well as preventing and or treating diseases and conditions associated with decreased T cell proliferation. Antibodies of the invention which block the binding of DR3 receptor ligands to DR3 receptors or interfere with DR3 receptor conformational changes associated with membrane signal transduction can inhibit DR3 mediated T cell apoptosis. The inhibition of DR3 mediated apoptosis can for examples either result in an increase in the expansion rate of in vivo T cell populations or prevent a decrease in the size of such populations. Thus antagonists of the invention can be used to prevent and or treat diseases or conditions associated with decreased or decreases in T cell populations. Examples of such diseases and conditions included acquired immune deficiency syndrome AIDS and related afflictions e.g. AIDS related complexes T cell immunodeficiencies radiation sickness and T cell depletion due to radiation and or chemotherapy.

Further when an antagonist of the invention is administered to an individual for the treatment and or prevention of a disease or condition associated with decreased T cell populations the antagonist may be co administered with an agent that activates and or induces lymphocyte proliferation e.g. a cytokine . Combination therapies of this nature as well as other combination therapies are discussed below in more detail.

Anti DR3 antibodies are thus useful for treating and or preventing malignancies abnormalities diseases and or conditions involving tissues and cell types which express DR3 receptors. Further malignancies abnormalities diseases and or conditions which can be treated and or prevented by the induction of programmed cell death in cells which express DR3 receptors can be treated and or prevented using DR3 receptor agonists of the invention. Similarly malignancies abnormalities diseases and or conditions which can be treated and or prevented by inhibiting programmed cell death in cells which express DR3 receptors can be treated and or prevented using DR3 receptor antagonists of the invention.

A number of additional malignancies abnormalities diseases and or conditions which can be treated using the agonists and antagonists of the invention are set out elsewhere herein for example in the section below entitled Therapeutics .

The antibodies of the present invention may be used therapeutically in a number of ways includes binding polynucleotides or polypeptides of the present invention locally or systemically in the body or by direct cytotoxicity of the antibody e.g. as mediated by complement CDC or by effector cells ADCC .

The antibodies of this invention may be advantageously utilized in combination with other monoclonal or chimeric antibodies or with lymphokines tumor necrosis factors e.g. TNF or hematopoietic growth factors e.g. IL 2 IL 3 and IL 7 . For example agonistic anti DR3 antibodies may be administered in conjunction with TNF when one seeks to induce DR3 mediated cell death in cells that express DR3 receptors of the invention. Combination therapies of this nature as well as other combination therapies are discussed below in more detail.

The antibodies of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with other types of treatments e.g. radiation therapy chemotherapy hormonal therapy immunotherapy and anti tumor agents . Generally administration of products of a species origin or species reactivity in the case of antibodies that is the same species as that of the patient is preferred. Thus in a preferred embodiment human antibodies fragments derivatives analogs or nucleic acids are administered to a human patient for therapy or prophylaxis.

It is preferred to use high affinity and or potent in vivo inhibiting and or neutralizing antibodies against polypeptides or polynucleotides of the present invention fragments or regions thereof for both immunoassays directed to and therapy of disorders related to polynucleotides or polypeptides including fragments thereof of the present invention. Such antibodies fragments or regions will preferably have an affinity for polynucleotides or polypeptides including fragments thereof. Preferred binding affinities include those with a dissociation constant or Kd less than 5 10M 10M 5 10M 10M 5 10M 10M 5 10M 10M 5 10M 10M 5 10M 10M 5 10M 10M 5 10M 10M 5 M 10M 5 10M and 10M.

The proteins of the invention can also be expressed in transgenic animals. Animals of any species including but not limited to mice rats rabbits hamsters guinea pigs pigs micro pigs goats sheep cows and non human primates e.g. baboons monkeys and chimpanzees may be used to generate transgenic animals. In a specific embodiment techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art are used to express polypeptides of the invention in humans as part of a gene therapy protocol.

Any technique known in the art may be used to introduce the transgene i.e. nucleic acids of the invention into animals to produce the founder lines of transgenic animals. Such techniques include but are not limited to pronuclear microinjection Paterson et al. 40 691 698 1994 Carver et al. 11 1263 1270 1993 Wright et al. NY 9 830 834 1991 and Hoppe et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 873 191 1989 retrovirus mediated gene transfer into germ lines Van der Putten et al. 82 6148 6152 1985 blastocysts or embryos gene targeting in embryonic stem cells Thompson et al. 56 313 321 1989 electroporation of cells or embryos Lo Mol. 3 1803 1814 1983 introduction of the polynucleotides of the invention using a gene gun see e.g. Ulmer et al. 259 1745 1993 introducing nucleic acid constructs into embryonic pluripotent stem cells and transferring the stem cells back into the blastocyst and sperm mediated gene transfer Lavitrano et al. 57 717 723 1989 etc. For a review of such techniques see Gordon Transgenic Animals 115 171 229 1989 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Further the contents of each of the documents recited in this paragraph are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. See also U.S. Pat. No. 5 464 764 Capecchi et al. Positive Negative Selection Methods and Vectors U.S. Pat. No. 5 631 153 Capecchi et al. Cells and Non Human Organisms Containing Predetermined Genomic Modifications and Positive Negative Selection Methods and Vectors for Making Same U.S. Pat. No. 4 736 866 Leder et al. Transgenic Non Human Animals and U.S. Pat. No. 4 873 191 Wagner et al. Genetic Transformation of Zygotes each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Any technique known in the art may be used to produce transgenic clones containing polynucleotides of the invention for example nuclear transfer into enucleated oocytes of nuclei from cultured embryonic fetal or adult cells induced to quiescence Campbell et al. 380 64 66 1996 Wilmut et al. 385 810 813 1997 each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety .

The present invention provides for transgenic animals that carry the transgene in all their cells as well as animals which carry the transgene in some but not all their cells i.e. mosaic animals or chimeric animals. The transgene may be integrated as a single transgene or as multiple copies such as in concatamers e.g. head to head tandems or head to tail tandems. The transgene may also be selectively introduced into and activated in a particular cell type by following for example the teaching of Lasko et al. Lasko et al. 89 6232 6236 1992 . The regulatory sequences required for such a cell type specific activation will depend upon the particular cell type of interest and will be apparent to those of skill in the art. When it is desired that the polynucleotide transgene be integrated into the chromosomal site of the endogenous gene gene targeting is preferred. Briefly when such a technique is to be utilized vectors containing some nucleotide sequences homologous to the endogenous gene are designed for the purpose of integrating via homologous recombination with chromosomal sequences into and disrupting the function of the nucleotide sequence of the endogenous gene. The transgene may also be selectively introduced into a particular cell type thus inactivating the endogenous gene in only that cell type by following for example the teaching of Gu et al. Gu et al. 265 103 106 1994 . The regulatory sequences required for such a cell type specific inactivation will depend upon the particular cell type of interest and will be apparent to those of skill in the art. The contents of each of the documents recited in this paragraph are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.

Once transgenic animals have been generated the expression of the recombinant gene may be assayed utilizing standard techniques. Initial screening may be accomplished by Southern blot analysis or PCR techniques to analyze animal tissues to verify that integration of the transgene has taken place. The level of mRNA expression of the transgene in the tissues of the transgenic animals may also be assessed using techniques which include but are not limited to Northern blot analysis of tissue samples obtained from the animal in situ hybridization analysis and reverse transcriptase PCR rt PCR . Samples of transgenic gene expressing tissue may also be evaluated immunocytochemically or immunohistochemically using antibodies specific for the transgene product.

Once the founder animals are produced they may be bred inbred outbred or crossbred to produce colonies of the particular animal. Examples of such breeding strategies include but are not limited to outbreeding of founder animals with more than one integration site in order to establish separate lines inbreeding of separate lines in order to produce compound transgenics that express the transgene at higher levels because of the effects of additive expression of each transgene crossing of heterozygous transgenic animals to produce animals homozygous for a given integration site in order to both augment expression and eliminate the need for screening of animals by DNA analysis crossing of separate homozygous lines to produce compound heterozygous or homozygous lines and breeding to place the transgene on a distinct background that is appropriate for an experimental model of interest.

Transgenic and knock out animals of the invention have uses which include but are not limited to animal model systems useful in elaborating the biological function of DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptides studying conditions and or disorders associated with aberrant DR3 V1 or DR3 expression and in screening for compounds effective in ameliorating such conditions and or disorders.

In further embodiments of the invention cells that are genetically engineered to express the proteins of the invention or alternatively that are genetically engineered not to express the proteins of the invention e.g. knockouts are administered to a patient in vivo. Such cells may be obtained from the patient i.e. animal including human or an MHC compatible donor and can include but are not limited to fibroblasts bone marrow cells blood cells e.g. lymphocytes adipocytes muscle cells endothelial cells etc. The cells are genetically engineered in vitro using recombinant DNA techniques to introduce the coding sequence of polypeptides of the invention into the cells or alternatively to disrupt the coding sequence and or endogenous regulatory sequence associated with the polypeptides of the invention e.g. by transduction using viral vectors and preferably vectors that integrate the transgene into the cell genome or transfection procedures including but not limited to the use of plasmids cosmids YACs naked DNA electroporation liposomes etc. The coding sequence of the polypeptides of the invention can be placed under the control of a strong constitutive or inducible promoter or promoter enhancer to achieve expression and preferably secretion of the polypeptides of the invention. The engineered cells that express and preferably secrete the polypeptides of the invention can be introduced into the patient systemically e.g. in the circulation or intraperitoneally. Alternatively the cells can be incorporated into a matrix and implanted in the body e.g. genetically engineered fibroblasts can be implanted as part of a skin graft genetically engineered endothelial cells can be implanted as part of a lymphatic or vascular graft. See e.g. Anderson et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 399 349 and Mulligan Wilson U.S. Pat. No. 5 460 959 each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety .

When the cells to be administered are non autologous or non MHC compatible cells they can be administered using well known techniques which prevent the development of a host immune response against the introduced cells. For example the cells may be introduced in an encapsulated form which while allowing for an exchange of components with the immediate extracellular environment does not allow the introduced cells to be recognized by the host immune system.

The Tumor Necrosis Factor TNF family ligands are known to be among the most pleiotropic cytokines inducing a large number of cellular responses including cytotoxicity anti viral activity immunoregulatory activities and the transcriptional regulation of several genes D. V. Goeddel et al. Tumor Necrosis Factors Gene Structure and Biological Activities 51 597 609 1986 Cold Spring Harbor B. Beutler and A. Cerami 57 505 518 1988 L. J. Old 258 59 75 1988 W. Fiers 285 199 224 1991 . The TNF family ligands induce such various cellular responses by binding to TNF family receptors including the DR3 V1 or DR3 of the present invention.

Cells which express the DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptide and are believed to have a potent cellular response to DR3 V1 or DR3 ligands include lymphocytes fibroblasts macrophages synovial cells activated T cells lymphoblasts and epithelial cells. By a cellular response to a TNF family ligand is intended any genotypic phenotypic and or morphologic change to a cell cell line tissue tissue culture or patient that is induced by a TNF family ligand. As indicated such cellular responses include not only normal physiological responses to TNF family ligands but also diseases associated with increased apoptosis or the inhibition of apoptosis. Apoptosis programmed cell death is a physiological mechanism involved in the deletion of peripheral T lymphocytes of the immune system and its dysregulation can lead to a number of different pathogenic processes J. C. Ameisen 8 1197 1213 1994 P. H. Krammer et al. 6 279 289 1994 .

DR3 V1 or DR3 polynucleotides polypeptides agonists or antagonists of the invention may be used in developing treatments and diagnostic prognostic assays for any disorder mediated directly or indirectly by defective or insufficient amounts of DR3. DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptides agonists or antagonists may be administered to a patient e.g. mammal preferably human afflicted with such a disorder. Alternatively a gene therapy approach may be applied to treat and or prevent such disorders. Disclosure herein of DR3 V1 or DR3 nucleotide sequences permits the detection of defective DR3 genes and the replacement thereof with normal DR3 encoding genes. Defective genes may be detected in in vitro diagnostic assays and by comparison of the DR3 V1 or DR3 nucleotide sequence disclosed herein with that of a DR3 gene derived from a patient suspected of harboring a defect in this gene.

Diseases associated with increased cell survival or the inhibition of apoptosis include cancers such as follicular lymphomas carcinomas with p53 mutations and hormone dependent tumors such as breast cancer prostrate cancer Kaposi sarcoma and ovarian cancer autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis Sjogren s syndrome Hashimoto s thyroiditis biliary cirrhosis Behcet s disease Crohn s disease polymyositis systemic lupus erythematosus immune related glomerulonephritis and rheumatoid arthritis and viral infections such as herpes viruses pox viruses and adenoviruses information graft versus host disease acute graft rejection and chronic graft rejection. Diseases associated with increased apoptosis include AIDS neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer s disease Parkinson s disease Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Retinitis pigmentosa Cerebellar degeneration myelodysplastic syndromes such as aplastic anemia ischemic injury such as that caused by myocardial infarction stroke and reperfusion injury toxin induced liver disease such as that caused by alcohol septic shock cachexia and anorexia.

Additional diseases or conditions associated with increased cell survival include but are not limited to progression and or metastases of malignancies and related disorders such as leukemia including acute leukemias e.g. acute lymphocytic leukemia acute myelocytic leukemia including myeloblastic promyelocytic myelomonocytic monocytic and erythroleukemia and chronic leukemias e.g. chronic myelocytic granulocytic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia polycythemia vera lymphomas e.g. Hodgkin s disease and non Hodgkin s disease multiple myeloma Waldenstrom s macroglobulinemia heavy chain disease and solid tumors including but not limited to sarcomas and carcinomas such as fibrosarcoma myxosarcoma liposarcoma chondrosarcoma osteogenic sarcoma chordoma angiosarcoma endotheliosarcoma lymphangiosarcoma lymphangioendotheliosarcoma synovioma mesothelioma Ewing s tumor leiomyosarcoma rhabdomyosarcoma colon carcinoma pancreatic cancer breast cancer ovarian cancer prostate cancer squamous cell carcinoma basal cell carcinoma adenocarcinoma sweat gland carcinoma sebaceous gland carcinoma papillary carcinoma papillary adenocarcinomas cystadenocarcinoma medullary carcinoma bronchogenic carcinoma renal cell carcinoma hepatoma bile duct carcinoma choriocarcinoma seminoma embryonal carcinoma Wilm s tumor cervical cancer testicular tumor lung carcinoma small cell lung carcinoma bladder carcinoma epithelial carcinoma glioma astrocytoma medulloblastoma craniopharyngioma ependymoma pinealoma hemangioblastoma acoustic neuroma oligodendroglioma menangioma melanoma neuroblastoma and retinoblastoma.

Diseases associated with increased apoptosis include AIDS neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer s disease Parkinson s disease Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Retinitis pigmentosa Cerebellar degeneration and brain tumor or prior associated disease autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis Sjogren s syndrome Grave s disease Hashimoto s thyroiditis autoimmune diabetes biliary cirrhosis Behcet s disease Crohn s disease polymyositis systemic lupus erythematosus immune related glomerulonephritis autoimmune gastritis thrombocytopenic purpura and rheumatoid arthritis myelodysplastic syndromes such as aplastic anemia graft vs. host disease acute and or chronic ischemic injury such as that caused by myocardial infarction stroke and reperfusion injury liver injury or disease e.g. hepatitis related liver injury cirrhosis ischemia reperfusion injury cholestosis bile duct injury and liver cancer toxin induced liver disease such as that caused by alcohol septic shock ulcerative colitis cachexia and anorexia. In preferred embodiments DR3 polynucleotides polypeptides agonists and or antagonists are used to treat prevent diagnose and or prognose the diseases and disorders listed above.

Thus in one aspect the present invention is directed to a method for enhancing apoptosis induced by a TNF family ligand which involves administering to a cell which expresses the DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptide an effective amount of DR3 V1 or DR3 ligand analog or an agonist capable of increasing DR3 V1 or DR3 mediated signaling. Preferably DR3 V1 or DR3 mediated signaling is increased to treat and or prevent a disease wherein decreased apoptosis or decreased cytokine and adhesion molecule expression is exhibited. An agonist can include soluble forms of DR3 V1 or DR3 and monoclonal antibodies directed against the DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptide.

In a further aspect the present invention is directed to a method for inhibiting apoptosis induced by a TNF family ligand which involves administering to a cell that expresses the DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptide an effective amount of an antagonist capable of decreasing DR3 V1 or DR3 mediated signaling. Preferably DR3 V1 or DR3 mediated signaling is decreased to treat and or prevent a disease wherein increased apoptosis or NF kB expression is exhibited. An antagonist can include soluble forms of DR3 V1 or DR3 and monoclonal antibodies directed against the DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptide.

In one more particular aspect the present invention is directed to compositions and methods useful for treating preventing and or diagnosing diseases wherein decreased apoptosis of T cells is exhibited. Examples of such diseases include but are not limited to graft vs. host disease acute and or chronic multiple sclerosis Sjogren s syndrome Grave s disease Hashimoto s thyroiditis autoimmune diabetes biliary cirrhosis Behcet s disease Crohn s disease polymyositis systemic lupus erythematosus immune related glomerulonephritis autoimmune gastritis thrombocytopenic purpura rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis.

In a further particular aspect the present invention is directed to compositions and methods useful for treating preventing and or diagnosing diseases wherein increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines e.g. IFN is exhibited. Examples of such diseases include but are not limited to graft vs. host disease acute and or chronic multiple sclerosis Sjogren s syndrome Grave s disease Hashimoto s thyroiditis autoimmune diabetes biliary cirrhosis Behcet s disease Crohn s disease polymyositis systemic lupus erythematosus immune related glomerulonephritis autoimmune gastritis thrombocytopenic purpura rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis.

In another aspect DR3 V1 Fc and DR3 Fc proteins and soluble portions of the extracellular domains of DR3 V1 and DR3 proteins are useful in stimulating neovascularization and angiogenesis. Thus these polypeptides are useful for example for the treatment and or prevention of diseases and conditions associated with hypovascularization e.g. Turner s syndrome cardiovascular aging bronchial stenosis depression .

Specifically included within the scope of the invention are DR3 V1 Fc and DR3 Fc proteins receptor Fc fusion proteins and nucleic acid molecules that encode such proteins. These fusion proteins include those having amino acid sequences of the extracellular domains of the DR3 proteins of the invention. Examples of portions of DR3 extracellular domains which are useful in the preparation of DR3 receptor Fc fusion proteins include amino acids 1 to 199 in SEQ ID NO 4 and amino acids 1 to 210 37 to 210 50 to 210 and 100 to 210 in SEQ ID NO 2.

In one more particular aspect DR3 V1 Fc and DR3 Fc proteins and soluble portions of the extracellular domains of DR3 V1 and DR3 proteins are useful for treating preventing and or diagnosing diseases wherein decreased apoptosis of T cells is exhibited. Examples of such diseases include but are not limited to graft vs. host disease acute and or chronic multiple sclerosis Sjogren s syndrome Grave s disease Hashimoto s thyroiditis autoimmune diabetes biliary cirrhosis Behcet s disease Crohn s disease polymyositis systemic lupus erythematosus immune related glomerulonephritis autoimmune gastritis thrombocytopenic purpura rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis.

In another aspect DR3 V1 Fc and DR3 Fc proteins and soluble portions of the extracellular domains of DR3 V1 and DR3 proteins are useful for treating preventing and or diagnosing diseases wherein increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines e.g. IFN is exhibited. Examples of such diseases include but are not limited to graft vs. host disease acute and or chronic multiple sclerosis Sjogren s syndrome Grave s disease Hashimoto s thyroiditis autoimmune diabetes biliary cirrhosis Behcet s disease Crohn s disease polymyositis systemic lupus erythematosus immune related glomerulonephritis autoimmune gastritis thrombocytopenic purpura rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis.

Further afflictions which can be treated and or prevented by DR3 V1 and DR3 mediated stimulation of angiogenesis include soft tissue traumas e.g. cuts and bruises ulcers e.g. peptic skin and venous and sclerodermas.

By agonist is intended naturally occurring and synthetic compounds capable of enhancing or potentiating apoptosis. By antagonist is intended naturally occurring and synthetic compounds capable of inhibiting apoptosis. Whether any candidate agonist or antagonist of the present invention can enhance or inhibit apoptosis can be determined using art known TNF family ligand receptor cellular response assays including those described in more detail below.

One such screening procedure involves the use of melanophores which are transfected to express the receptor of the present invention. Such a screening technique is described in PCT WO 92 01810 published Feb. 6 1992. Such an assay may be employed for example for screening for a compound that inhibits or enhances activation of the receptor polypeptide of the present invention by contacting the melanophore cells which encode the receptor with both a TNF family ligand and the candidate antagonist or agonist . Inhibition or enhancement of the signal generated by the ligand indicates that the compound is an antagonist or agonist of the ligand receptor signaling pathway.

Other screening techniques include the use of cells which express the receptor for example transfected CHO cells in a system which measures extracellular pH changes caused by receptor activation for example as described in 246 181 296 October 1989 . For example compounds may be contacted with a cell which expresses the receptor polypeptide of the present invention and a second messenger response e.g. signal transduction or pH changes may be measured to determine whether the potential compound activates or inhibits the receptor.

Another such screening technique involves introducing RNA encoding the receptor into oocytes to transiently express the receptor. The receptor oocytes may then be contacted with the receptor ligand and a compound to be screened followed by detection of inhibition or activation of a calcium signal in the case of screening for compounds that are thought to inhibit activation of the receptor.

Another screening technique involves expressing in cells a construct wherein the receptor is linked to a phospholipase C or D. Such cells include endothelial cells smooth muscle cells embryonic kidney cells etc. The screening may be accomplished as herein above described by detecting activation of the receptor or inhibition of activation of the receptor from the phospholipase signal.

Another method involves screening for compounds that inhibit activation of the receptor polypeptide of the present invention antagonists by determining inhibition of binding of labeled ligand to cells that have the receptor on the surface thereof. Such a method involves transfecting a eukaryotic cell with DNA encoding the receptor such that the cell expresses the receptor on its surface and contacting the cell with a compound in the presence of a labeled form of a known ligand. The ligand can be labeled e.g. by radioactivity. The amount of labeled ligand bound to the receptors is measured e.g. by measuring radioactivity of the receptors. If the compound binds to the receptor as determined by a reduction of labeled ligand that binds to the receptors the binding of labeled ligand to the receptor is inhibited.

Further screening assays for agonist and antagonist of the present invention are described in L. A. Tartaglia and D. V. Goeddel 267 4304 4307 1992 .

Thus in a further aspect a screening method is provided for determining whether a candidate agonist or antagonist is capable of enhancing or inhibiting a cellular response to a TNF family ligand. The method involves contacting cells which express the DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptide with a candidate compound and a TNF family ligand assaying a cellular response and comparing the cellular response to a standard cellular response the standard being assayed when contact is made with the ligand in absence of the candidate compound whereby an increased cellular response over the standard indicates that the candidate compound is an agonist of the ligand receptor signaling pathway and a decreased cellular response compared to the standard indicates that the candidate compound is an antagonist of the ligand receptor signaling pathway. By assaying a cellular response is intended qualitatively or quantitatively measuring a cellular response to a candidate compound and or a TNF family ligand e.g. determining or estimating an increase or decrease in T cell proliferation or tritiated thymidine labeling . By the invention a cell expressing the DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptide can be contacted with either an endogenous or exogenously administered TNF family ligand.

Agonist according to the present invention include naturally occurring and synthetic compounds such as for example TNF family ligand peptide fragments transforming growth factor neurotransmitters such as glutamate dopamine N methyl D aspartate tumor suppressors p53 cytolytic T cells and antimetabolites. Preferred agonist include chemotherapeutic drugs such as for example cisplatin doxorubicin bleomycin cytosine arabinoside nitrogen mustard methotrexate and vincristine. Others include ethanol and amyloid peptide 267 1457 1458 1995 . Further preferred agonists include polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies raised against the DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptide or a fragment thereof. Such agonist antibodies raised against a TNF family receptor are disclosed in L. A. Tartaglia et al. 88 9292 9296 1991 and L. A. Tartaglia and D. V. Goeddel supra. See also PCT Application WO 94 09137.

Antagonists according to the present invention include naturally occurring and synthetic compounds such as for example the CD40 ligand neutral amino acids zinc estrogen androgens viral genes such as Adenovirus ElB Baculovirus p35 and IAP Cowpox virus crmA Epstein Barr virus BHRF1 LMP 1 African swine fever virus LMW5 HL and Herpes virus yl 34.5 calpain inhibitors cysteine protease inhibitors and tumor promoters such as PMA Phenobarbital and Hexachlorocyclohexane .

Other potential antagonists include antisense molecules. Thus in specific embodiments antagonists according to the present invention are nucleic acids corresponding to the sequences contained in DR3 V1 or DR3 or the complementary strand thereof and or to nucleotide sequences contained in the deposited cDNAs having ATCC Deposit No. 97456 and 97757. In one embodiment antisense sequence is generated internally by the organism in another embodiment the antisense sequence is separately administered see for example O Connor J. 56 560 1991 and Oligodeoxynucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression CRC Press Boca Raton Fla. 1988 . Antisense technology can be used to control gene expression through antisense DNA or RNA or through triple helix formation. Antisense techniques are discussed for example in Okano J. 56 560 1991 Oligodeoxynucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression CRC Press Boca Raton Fla. 1988 . Triple helix formation is discussed in for instance Lee et al. Nucleic Acids Research 6 3073 1979 Cooney et al. 241 456 1988 and Dervan et al. 251 1300 1991 . The methods are based on binding of a polynucleotide to a complementary DNA or RNA.

For example the 5 coding portion of a polynucleotide that encodes the mature polypeptide of the present invention may be used to design an antisense RNA oligonucleotide of from about 10 to 40 base pairs in length. A DNA oligonucleotide is designed to be complementary to a region of the gene involved in transcription thereby preventing transcription and the production of the receptor. The antisense RNA oligonucleotide hybridizes to the mRNA in vivo and blocks translation of the mRNA molecule into receptor polypeptide.

In one embodiment the DR3 V1 or DR3 antisense nucleic acid of the invention is produced intracellularly by transcription from an exogenous sequence. For example a vector or a portion thereof is transcribed producing an antisense nucleic acid RNA of the invention. Such a vector would contain a sequence encoding the DR3 V1 or DR3 antisense nucleic acid. Such a vector can remain episomal or become chromosomally integrated as long as it can be transcribed to produce the desired antisense RNA. Such vectors can be constructed by recombinant DNA technology methods standard in the art. Vectors can be plasmid viral or others know in the art used for replication and expression invertebrate cells. Expression of the sequence encoding DR3 V1 or DR3 or fragments thereof can be by any promoter known in the art to act in vertebrate preferably human cells. Such promoters can be inducible or constitutive. Such promoters include but are not limited to the SV40 early promoter region Bernoist and Chambon Nature 29 304 310 1981 the promoter contained in the 3 long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus Yamamoto et al. 22 787 797 1980 the herpes thymidine promoter Wagner et al. 78 1441 1445 1981 the regulatory sequences of the metallothionein gene Brinster et al. 296 39 42 1982 etc.

The antisense nucleic acids of the invention comprise or alternatively consist of a sequence complementary to at least a portion of an RNA transcript of a DR3 gene. However absolute complementarity although preferred is not required. A sequence complementary to at least a portion of an RNA referred to herein means a sequence having sufficient complementarity to be able to hybridize with the RNA forming a stable duplex in the case of double stranded DR3 V1 or DR3 antisense nucleic acids a single strand of the duplex DNA may thus be tested or triplex formation may be assayed. The ability to hybridize will depend on both the degree of complementarity and the length of the antisense nucleic acid Generally the larger the hybridizing nucleic acid the more base mismatches with a DR3 V1 or DR3 RNA it may contain and still form a stable duplex or triplex as the case may be . One skilled in the art can ascertain a tolerable degree of mismatch by use of standard procedures to determine the melting point of the hybridized complex.

Oligonucleotides that are complementary to the 5 end of the message e.g. the 5 untranslated sequence up to and including the AUG initiation codon should work most efficiently at inhibiting translation. However sequences complementary to the 3 untranslated sequences of mRNAs have been shown to be effective at inhibiting translation of mRNAs as well. See generally Wagner R. 372 333 335 1994 . Thus oligonucleotides complementary to either the 5 or 3 non translated non coding regions of the DR3 V1 or DR3 shown in SEQ ID NO 2 and SEQ ID NO 4 could be used in an antisense approach to inhibit translation of endogenous DR3 V1 or DR3 mRNA. Oligonucleotides complementary to the 5 untranslated region of the mRNA should include the complement of the AUG start codon. Antisense oligonucleotides complementary to mRNA coding regions are less efficient inhibitors of translation but could be used in accordance with the invention. Whether designed to hybridize to the 5 3 or coding region of DR3 V1 or DR3 mRNA antisense nucleic acids should be at least six nucleotides in length and are preferably oligonucleotides ranging from 6 to about 50 nucleotides in length. In specific aspects the oligonucleotide is at least about 10 nucleotides at least about 17 nucleotides at least about 25 nucleotides or at least about 50 nucleotides. In this context about includes the particularly recited value and values larger or smaller by several 5 4 3 2 or 1 nucleotides.

The polynucleotides of the invention can be DNA or RNA or chimeric mixtures or derivatives or modified versions thereof single stranded or double stranded. The oligonucleotide can be modified at the base moiety sugar moiety or phosphate backbone for example to improve stability of the molecule hybridization etc. The oligonucleotide may include other appended groups such as peptides e.g. for targeting host cell receptors in vivo or agents facilitating transport across the cell membrane see e.g. Letsinger et al. 86 6553 6556 1989 Lemaitre et al. 84 648 652 1987 PCT Publication No. WO88 09810 published Dec. 15 1988 or the blood brain barrier see e.g. PCT Publication No. WO89 10134 published Apr. 25 1988 hybridization triggered cleavage agents See e.g. Krol et al. 6 958 976 1988 or intercalating agents See e.g. Zon 5 539 549 1988 . To this end the oligonucleotide may be conjugated to another molecule e.g. a peptide hybridization triggered cross linking agent transport agent hybridization triggered cleavage agent etc.

The antisense oligonucleotide may comprise at least one modified base moiety which is selected from the group including but not limited to 5 fluorouracil 5 bromouracil 5 chlorouracil 5 iodouracil hypoxanthine xanthine 4 acetylcytosine 5 carboxyhydroxylmethyl uracil 5 carboxymethylaminomethyl 2 thiouridine 5 carboxymethylaminomethyluracil dihydrouracil D galactosylqueosine inosine N6 isopentenyladenine 1 methylguanine 1 methylinosine 2 2 dimethylguanine 2 methyladenine 2 methylguanine 3 methylcytosine 5 methylcytosine N6 adenine 7 methylguanine 5 methylaminomethyluracil 5 methoxyaminomethyl 2 thiouracil D mannosylqueosine 5 methoxycarboxymethyluracil 5 methoxyuracil 2 methylthio N 6 isopentenyladenine uracil 5 oxyacetic acid v wybutoxosine pseudouracil queosine 2 thiocytosine 5 methyl 2 thiouracil 2 thiouracil 4 thiouracil 5 methyluracil uracil 5 oxyacetic acid methylester uracil 5 oxyacetic acid v 5 methyl 2 thiouracil 3 3 amino 3 N 2 carboxypropyl uracil acp3 w and 2 6 diaminopurine.

The antisense oligonucleotide may also comprise at least one modified sugar moiety selected from the group including but not limited to arabinose 2 fluoroarabinose xylulose and hexose.

In yet another embodiment the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified phosphate backbone selected from the group including but not limited to a phosphorothioate a phosphorodithioate a phosphoramidothioate a phosphoramidate a phosphordiamidate a methylphosphonate an alkyl phosphotriester and a formacetal or analog thereof.

In yet another embodiment the antisense oligonucleotide is an anomeric oligonucleotide. An anomeric oligonucleotide forms specific double stranded hybrids with complementary RNA in which contrary to the usual units the strands run parallel to each other Gautier et al. 15 6625 6641 1987 . The oligonucleotide is a 2 0 methylribonucleotide Inoue et al. 15 6131 6148 1987 or a chimeric RNA DNA analogue Inoue et al. 215 327 330 1987 .

Polynucleotides of the invention may be synthesized by standard methods known in the art e.g. by use of an automated DNA synthesizer such as are commercially available from Biosearch Applied Biosystems etc. . As examples phosphorothioate oligonucleotides may be synthesized by the method of Stein et al. 16 3209 1988 methylphosphonate oligonucleotides can be prepared by use of controlled pore glass polymer supports Sarin et al. 85 7448 7451 1988 etc.

While antisense nucleotides complementary to the DR3 V1 or DR3 coding region sequence could be used those complementary to the transcribed untranslated region are most preferred.

Potential antagonists according to the invention also include catalytic RNA or a ribozyme See e.g. PCT International Publication WO 90 11364 published Oct. 4 1990 Sarver et al. 247 1222 1225 1990 . While ribozymes that cleave mRNA at site specific recognition sequences can be used to destroy DR3 V1 or DR3 mRNAs the use of hammerhead ribozymes is preferred. Hammerhead ribozymes cleave mRNAs at locations dictated by flanking regions that form complementary base pairs with the target mRNA. The sole requirement is that the target mRNA have the following sequence of two bases 5 UG 3 . The construction and production of hammerhead ribozymes is well known in the art and is described more fully in Haseloff and Gerlach Nature 334 585 591 1988 . There are numerous potential hammerhead ribozyme cleavage sites within the nucleotide sequence of DR3 V1 SEQ ID NO 2 or DR3 SEQ ID NO 4 . Preferably the ribozyme is engineered so that the cleavage recognition site is located near the 5 end of the DR3 V1 or DR3 mRNA i.e. to increase efficiency and minimize the intracellular accumulation of non functional mRNA transcripts.

As in the antisense approach the ribozymes of the invention can be composed of modified oligonucleotides e.g. for improved stability targeting etc. and should be delivered to cells that express DR3 V1 or DR3 in vivo. DNA constructs encoding the ribozyme may be introduced into the cell in the same manner as described above for the introduction of antisense encoding DNA. A preferred method of delivery involves using a DNA construct encoding the ribozyme under the control of a strong constitutive promoter such as for example pol III or pol II promoter so that transfected cells will produce sufficient quantities of the ribozyme to destroy endogenous DR3 V1 or DR3 messages and inhibit translation. Since ribozymes unlike antisense molecules are catalytic a lower intracellular concentration is required for efficiency.

Endogenous gene expression can also be reduced by inactivating or knocking out the DR3 gene and or its promoter using targeted homologous recombination. See e.g. Smithies et al. 317 230 234 1985 Thomas Capecchi 51 503 512 1987 Thompson et al. 5 313 321 1989 each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . For example a mutant non functional polynucleotide of the invention or a completely unrelated DNA sequence flanked by DNA homologous to the endogenous polynucleotide sequence either the coding regions or regulatory regions of the gene can be used with or without a selectable marker and or a negative selectable marker to transfect cells that express polypeptides of the invention in vivo. In another embodiment techniques known in the art are used to generate knockouts in cells that contain but do not express the gene of interest. Insertion of the DNA construct via targeted homologous recombination results in inactivation of the targeted gene. Such approaches are particularly suited in research and agricultural fields where modifications to embryonic stem cells can be used to generate animal offspring with an inactive targeted gene see e.g. Thomas Capecchi 1987 and Thompson 1989 supra . However this approach can be routinely adapted for use in humans provided the recombinant DNA constructs are directly administered or targeted to the required site in vivo using appropriate viral vectors that will be apparent to those of skill in the art. The contents of each of the documents recited in this paragraph are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.

In other embodiments antagonists according to the present invention include soluble forms of DR3 V1 or DR3 e.g. fragments of the DR3 V1 shown in SEQ ID NO 2 and DR3 shown in SEQ ID NO 4 that include the ligand binding domain from the extracellular region of the full length receptor. Such soluble forms of the DR3 V1 or DR3 which may be naturally occurring or synthetic antagonize DR3 V1 or DR3 mediated signaling by competing with the cell surface bound forms of the receptor for binding to TNF family ligands. Antagonists of the present invention also include antibodies specific for TNF family ligands and both DR3 V1 Fc and DR3 Fc fusion proteins.

In one particular aspect soluble forms of DR3 V1 or DR3 e.g. fragments of the DR3 V1 shown in SEQ ID NO 2 and DR3 shown in SEQ ID NO 4 that include the ligand binding domain from the extracellular region of the full length receptor are useful for treating preventing and or diagnosing diseases wherein decreased apoptosis of T cells is exhibited. Examples of such diseases include but are not limited to graft vs. host disease acute and or chronic multiple sclerosis Sjogren s syndrome Grave s disease Hashimoto s thyroiditis autoimmune diabetes biliary cirrhosis Behcet s disease Crohn s disease polymyositis systemic lupus erythematosus immune related glomerulonephritis autoimmune gastritis thrombocytopenic purpura rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis.

In another aspect soluble forms of DR3 V1 or DR3 e.g. fragments of the DR3 V1 shown in SEQ ID NO 2 and DR3 shown in SEQ ID NO 4 that include the ligand binding domain from the extracellular region of the full length receptor are useful for treating preventing and or diagnosing diseases wherein increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines e.g. IFN is exhibited. Examples of such diseases include but are not limited to graft vs. host disease acute and or chronic multiple sclerosis Sjogren s syndrome Grave s disease Hashimoto s thyroiditis autoimmune diabetes biliary cirrhosis Behcet s disease Crohn s disease polymyositis systemic lupus erythematosus immune related glomerulonephritis autoimmune gastritis thrombocytopenic purpura rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis.

By a TNF family ligand is intended naturally occurring recombinant and synthetic ligands that are capable of binding to a member of the TNF receptor family and inducing and or blocking the ligand receptor signaling pathway. Members of the TNF ligand family include but are not limited to TNF lymphotoxin LT also known as TNF LT found in complex heterotrimer LT 2 FasL TNF International Publication No. WO 96 14328 TNF TNF International Publication No. WO 00 08139 AIM I International Publication No. WO 97 33899 AIM II International Publication No. WO 97 34911 APRIL 188 6 1185 1190 endokine International Publication No. WO 98 07880 neutrokine International Publication No. WO 98 18921 CD40L CD27L CD30L 4 1BBL OX40L and nerve growth factor NGF .

Antibodies according to the present invention may be prepared by any of a variety of standard methods using DR3 V1 or DR3 receptor immunogens of the present invention. Such DR3 V1 or DR3 receptor immunogens include the DR3 V1 protein shown in SEQ ID NO 2 and the DR3 protein shown in SEQ ID NO 4 each of which may or may not include a leader sequence and polypeptide fragments of the receptor comprising or alternatively consisting of the ligand binding extracellular transmembrane the intracellular domains of DR3 V1 or DR3 or any combination thereof.

Polyclonal and monoclonal antibody agonists or antagonists according to the present invention can be raised according to the methods disclosed herein and or known in the art such as for example those methods described in Tartaglia and Goeddel 267 7 4304 4307 1992 Tartaglia et al. 73 213 216 1993 and PCT Application WO 94 09137 the contents of each of these three applications are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties and are preferably specific to polypeptides of the invention having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NOs 2 or 4.

In one particular aspect polyclonal and monoclonal antibody agonists or antagonists according to the present invention are useful for treating preventing and or diagnosing diseases wherein decreased apoptosis of T cells is exhibited. Examples of such diseases include but are not limited to graft vs. host disease acute and or chronic multiple sclerosis Sjogren s syndrome Grave s disease Hashimoto s thyroiditis autoimmune diabetes biliary cirrhosis Behcet s disease Crohn s disease polymyositis systemic lupus erythematosus immune related glomerulonephritis autoimmune gastritis thrombocytopenic purpura rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis.

In another aspect polyclonal and monoclonal antibody agonists or antagonists according to the present invention are useful for treating preventing and or diagnosing diseases wherein increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines e.g. IFN is exhibited. Examples of such diseases include but are not limited to graft vs. host disease acute and or chronic multiple sclerosis Sjogren s syndrome Grave s disease Hashimoto s thyroiditis autoimmune diabetes biliary cirrhosis Behcet s disease Crohn s disease polymyositis systemic lupus erythematosus immune related glomerulonephritis autoimmune gastritis thrombocytopenic purpura rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis.

Further antagonist according to the present invention include soluble forms of DR3 V1 or DR3 i.e. DR3 V1 or DR3 fragments that include the ligand binding domain from the extracellular region of the full length receptor. Such soluble forms of the receptor which may be naturally occurring or synthetic antagonize DR3 V1 or DR3 mediated signaling by competing with the cell surface DR3 V1 or DR3 for binding to TNF family ligands. Thus soluble forms of the receptor that include the ligand binding domain are novel cytokines capable of inhibiting apoptosis induced by TNF family ligands. These are preferably expressed as dimers or trimers since these have been shown to be superior to monomeric forms of soluble receptor as antagonists e.g. IgG Fc TNF receptor family fusions. Other such cytokines are known in the art and include Fas B a soluble form of the mouse Fas receptor that acts physiologically to limit apoptosis induced by Fas ligand D. P. Hughes and I. N. Crispe 182 1395 1401 1995 .

The experiments set forth in Examples 6 and 7 demonstrate that DR3 is a death domain containing molecule capable of triggering both apoptosis and NF kB activation two pathways dominant in the regulation of the immune system. The experiments also demonstrate the internal signal transduction machinery of this novel cell death receptor. In addition the experiments set forth below demonstrate that DR3 induced apoptosis was blocked by the inhibitors of ICE like proteases CrmA and z VAD fmk. Importantly apoptosis induced by DR3 was also blocked by dominant negative versions of FADD FADD DN or FLICE FLICE DN MACHa1C360S which were previously shown to inhibit death signaling by Fas APO 1 and TNFR 1. Thus inhibitors of ICE like proteases FADD DN and FLICE DN MACHa1C360S could also be used as antagonists for DR3 activity.

The term antibody Ab or monoclonal antibody mnAb as used herein is meant to include intact molecules as well as fragments thereof such as for example Fab and F ab fragments which are capable of binding an antigen. Fab and F ab fragments lack the Fc fragment of intact antibody clear more rapidly from the circulation and may have less non specific tissue binding of an intact antibody Wahl et al. 24 316 325 1983 .

Antibodies according to the present invention may be prepared by any of a variety of methods using DR3 V1 or DR3 immunogens of the present invention. As indicated such DR3 V1 or DR3 immunogens include the full length DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptide which may or may not include the leader sequence and DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptide fragments such as the ligand binding domain the transmembrane domain the intracellular domain and the death domain.

Proteins and other compounds that bind the DR3 V1 or DR3 domains are also candidate agonist and antagonist according to the present invention. Such binding compounds can be captured using the yeast two hybrid system Fields and Song 340 245 246 1989 . A modified version of the yeast two hybrid system has been described by Roger Brent and his colleagues J. Gyuris et al. 75 791 803 1993 A. S. Zervos et al. 72 223 232 1993 . Preferably the yeast two hybrid system is used according to the present invention to capture compounds that bind to either the DR3 V1 or DR3 ligand binding domain or to the DR3 V1 or DR3 intracellular domain. Such compounds are good candidate agonist and antagonist of the present invention.

By a TNF family ligand is intended naturally occurring recombinant and synthetic ligands that are capable of binding to a member of the TNF receptor family and inducing the ligand receptor signaling pathway. Members of the TNF ligand family include but are not limited to the DR3 V1 or DR3 ligand TNF lymphotoxin LT also known as TNF International Publication No. WO 96 14328 TNF PCT Publication No. WO 00 08139 TNF PCT ion No. WO 00 08139 LT found in complex heterotrimer LT 2 FasL CD40 CD27 CD30 4 1BB OX40 and nerve growth factor NGF .

Representative therapeutic applications of the present invention are discussed in more detail below. The state of immunodeficiency that defines AIDS is secondary to a decrease in the number and function of CD4T lymphocytes. Recent reports estimate the daily loss of CD4T cells to be between 3.5 10and 2 10cells X. Wei et al. 373 117 122 1995 . One cause of CD4T cell depletion in the setting of HIV infection is believed to be HIV induced apoptosis. Indeed HIV induced apoptotic cell death has been demonstrated not only in vitro but also more importantly in infected individuals J. C. Ameisen 8 1197 1213 1994 T. H. Finkel and N. K. Banda 6 605 615 1995 C. A. Muro Cacho et al. 154 5555 5566 1995 . Furthermore apoptosis and CD4 T lymphocyte depletion are tightly correlated in different animal models of AIDS T. Brunner et al. 373 441 444 1995 M. L. Gougeon et al. 9 553 563 1993 and apoptosis is not observed in those animal models in which viral replication does not result in AIDS. Id. Further data indicates that uninfected but primed or activated T lymphocytes from HIV infected individuals undergo apoptosis after encountering the TNF family ligand FasL. Using monocytic cell lines that result in death following HIV infection it has been demonstrated that infection of U937 cells with HIV results in the de novo expression of FasL and that FasL mediates HIV induced apoptosis A. D. Badley et al. 70 199 206 1996 . Further the TNF family ligand was detectable in uninfected macrophages and its expression was upregulated following HIV infection resulting in selective killing of uninfected CD4 T lymphocytes. Id. Thus by the invention a method for treating HIV individuals is provided which involves administering an antagonist of the present invention to reduce selective killing of CD4 T lymphocytes. Modes of administration and dosages are discussed in detail below.

In rejection of an allograft the immune system of the recipient animal has not previously been primed to respond because the immune system for the most part is only primed by environmental antigens. Tissues from other members of the same species have not been presented in the same way that for example viruses and bacteria have been presented. In the case of allograft rejection immunosuppressive regimens are designed to prevent the immune system from reaching the effector stage. However the immune profile of xenograft rejection may resemble disease recurrence more that allograft rejection. In the case of disease recurrence the immune system has already been activated as evidenced by destruction of the native islet cells. Therefore in disease recurrence the immune system is already at the effector stage. Agonist of the present invention are able to suppress the immune response to both allografts and xenografts because lymphocytes activated and differentiated into effector cells will express the DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptide and thereby are susceptible to compounds which enhance apoptosis. Thus the present invention further provides a method for creating immune privileged tissues. Antagonist of the invention can further be used in the treatment and or prevention of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

DR3 like TNFR1 also activates the NF kB transcription factor which is very closely associated with the stimulation of cytokine e.g. IL 8 and adhesion molecule e.g. ELAM transcription. Hence like TNF the ligand or agonist for DR3 and DR3 V1 may in some circumstances be proinflammatory and antagonists may be useful reagents for blocking this response. Thus DR3 and DR3 V1 antagonists may be useful for treating preventing diagnosing and or prognosing inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis psoriasis septicemia and inflammatory bowel disease.

In addition due to lymphoblast expression of DR3 soluble DR3 agonist or antagonist mABs may be used to diagnose prognose treat and or prevent this form of cancer. Further soluble DR3 or neutralizing mABs may be used to treat and or prevent various chronic and acute forms of inflammation such as rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis psoriasis septicemia and inflammatory bowel disease.

In one embodiment a DR3 polynucleotide polypeptide agonist or antagonist of the invention is used to diagnose prognose treat and or prevent thrombotic microangiopathies. One such disorder is thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura TTP Kwaan H. C. 24 71 1987 Thompson et al. 80 1890 1992 . Increasing TTP associated mortality rates have been reported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control Torok et al. 50 84 1995 . Plasma from patients afflicted with TTP including HIV and HIV patients induces apoptosis of human endothelial cells of dermal microvascular origin but not large vessel origin Laurence et al. 87 3245 1996 . Plasma of TTP patients thus is thought to contain one or more factors that directly or indirectly induce apoptosis. Another thrombotic microangiopathy is hemolytic uremic syndrome HUS Moake J. L. 343 393 1994 Melnyk et al. 155 2077 1995 Thompson et al. supra . Thus in one embodiment the invention is directed to use of DR3 to diagnose prognose treat and or prevent the condition that is often referred to as adult HUS even though it can strike children as well . A disorder known as childhood diarrhea associated HUS differs in etiology from adult HUS. In another embodiment conditions characterized by clotting of small blood vessels may be diagnosed prognosed treated and or prevented using DR3. Such conditions include but are not limited to those described herein. For example cardiac problems seen in about 5 10 of pediatric AIDS patients are believed to involve clotting of small blood vessels. Breakdown of the microvasculature in the heart has been reported in multiple sclerosis patients. As a further example treatment prevention diagnosis and or prognosis of systemic lupus erythematosus SLE is contemplated.

DR3 polynucleotides polypeptides agonists or antagonists of the invention may be employed in combination with other agents useful in treating preventing diagnosing and or prognosing a particular disorder. For example in an in vitro study reported by Laurence et al. 87 3245 1996 some reduction of TTP plasma mediated apoptosis of microvascular endothelial cells was achieved by using an anti Fas blocking antibody aurintricarboxylic acid or normal plasma depleted of cryoprecipitate. Thus a patient may be treated with a polynucleotide and or polypeptide of the invention in combination with an agent that inhibits Fas ligand mediated apoptosis of endothelial cells such as for example an agent described above. In one embodiment a DR3 polynucleotide polypeptide agonist or antagonist and an anti FAS blocking antibody are both administered to a patient afflicted with a disorder characterized by thrombotic microangiopathy such as TTP or HUS. Examples of blocking monoclonal antibodies directed against Fas antigen CD95 are described in International patent application publication number WO 95 10540 hereby incorporated by reference.

The naturally occurring balance between endogenous stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis is one in which inhibitory influences predominate. Rastinejad et al. 56 345 355 1989 . In those rare instances in which neovascularization occurs under normal physiological conditions such as wound healing organ regeneration embryonic development and female reproductive processes angiogenesis is stringently regulated and spatially and temporally delimited. Under conditions of pathological angiogenesis such as that characterizing solid tumor growth these regulatory controls fail.

Unregulated angiogenesis becomes pathologic and sustains progression of many neoplastic and non neoplastic diseases. A number of serious diseases are dominated by abnormal neovascularization including solid tumor growth and metastases arthritis some types of eye disorders and psoriasis. See e.g. reviews by Moses et al. 9 630 634 1991 Folkman et al. 333 1757 1763 1995 Auerbach et al. 29 401 411 1985 Folkman Advances in Cancer Research eds. Klein and Weinhouse Academic Press New York pp. 175 203 1985 Patz 94 715 743 1982 and Folkman et al. 221 719 725 1983 . In a number of pathological conditions the process of angiogenesis contributes to the disease state. For example significant data have accumulated which suggest that the growth of solid tumors is dependent on angiogenesis. Folkman and Klagsbrun 235 442 447 1987 .

See e.g. reviews by Waltman et al. 85 704 710 1978 and Gartner et al. 22 291 312 1978 .

Additionally disorders which can be diagnosed prognosed treated and or prevented with the DR3 polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention including DR3 agonists and DR3 antagonists include but are not limited to hemangioma arthritis psoriasis angiofibroma atherosclerotic plaques delayed wound healing granulations hemophilic joints hypertrophic scars nonunion fractures Osler Weber syndrome pyogenic granuloma scleroderma trachoma and vascular adhesions.

Polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention and or agonists and or antagonists thereof are useful in the prognosis diagnosis treatment and or prevention of a wide range of diseases and or conditions. Such diseases and conditions include but are not limited to cancer e.g. immune cell related cancers breast cancer prostate cancer ovarian cancer follicular lymphoma glioblastoma cancer associated with mutation or alteration of p53 brain tumor bladder cancer uterocervical cancer colon cancer colorectal cancer non small cell carcinoma of the lung small cell carcinoma of the lung stomach cancer etc. lymphoproliferative disorders e.g. lymphadenopathy and lymphomas e.g. EBV induced lymphoproliferations and Hodgkin s disease microbial e.g. viral bacterial etc. infection e.g. HIV 1 infection HIV 2 infection herpesvirus infection including but not limited to HSV 1 HSV 2 CMV VZV HHV 6 HHV 7 EBV adenovirus infection poxvirus infection human papilloma virus infection hepatitis infection e.g. HAV HBV HCV etc. infection invasive etc. parasitic infection nephritis bone disease e.g. osteoporosis atherosclerosis pain cardiovascular disorders e.g. neovascularization hypovascularization or reduced circulation e.g. ischemic disease e.g. myocardial infarction stroke etc. AIDS allergy inflammation neurodegenerative disease e.g. Alzheimer s disease Parkinson s disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pigmentary retinitis cerebellar degeneration etc. graft rejection acute and chronic graft vs. host disease diseases due to osteomyelodysplasia e.g. aplastic anemia etc. joint tissue destruction in rheumatism liver disease e.g. acute and chronic hepatitis liver injury and cirrhosis autoimmune disease e.g. multiple sclerosis myasthenia gravis rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus immune complex glomerulonephritis autoimmune diabetes autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura Grave s disease Hashimoto s thyroiditis inflammatory autoimmune diseases etc. cardiomyopathy e.g. dilated cardiomyopathy diabetes diabetic complications e.g. diabetic nephropathy diabetic neuropathy diabetic retinopathy influenza asthma psoriasis glomerulonephritis septic shock and ulcerative colitis.

Polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention and or agonists and or antagonists thereof are useful in promoting angiogenesis wound healing e.g. wounds burns and bone fractures and regulating bone formation and treating and or preventing osteoporosis.

Polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention and or agonists and or antagonists thereof are also useful as an adjuvant to enhance immune responsiveness to specific antigen and or anti viral immune responses.

More generally polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention and or agonists and or antagonists thereof are useful in regulating i.e. elevating or reducing immune response. For example polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention may be useful in preparation or recovery from surgery trauma radiation therapy chemotherapy and transplantation or may be used to boost immune response and or recovery in the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Alternatively polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention and or agonists and or antagonists thereof are useful as immunosuppressive agents for example in the treatment and or prevention of autoimmune disorders or in the prevention of transplant rejection. In specific embodiments polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention are used to diagnose prognose treat and or prevent chronic inflammatory allergic or autoimmune conditions such as those described herein or are otherwise known in the art.

In additional embodiments DR3 and or DR3 V1 polynucleotides polynucleotides and or other compositions of the invention e.g. DR3 and or DR3 V1 Fc or albumin fusion proteins are used to diagnose treat or prevent diseases or conditions associated with allergy and or inflammation. As demonstrated in Example 15 below it has been shown that DR3 interacts with TNF gamma beta a TNF ligand family member described in detail in International Publication Numbers WO96 14328 WO00 66608 and WO00 08139. TNF gamma beta is a proinflammatory molecule as evidenced by its ability to induce T cell proliferation and secretion of Interferon gamma and GM CSF by T cells. TNF gamma beta is also able to enhance an in vivo mixed lymphocyte reaction MLR as measured by the parent into F1 model of acute graft vs. host disease in which C57BL 6 splenic T cells are transferred into BALB c x C57BL 6 F1 mice. Thus the ability of DR3 to bind TNF gamma beta and to prevent TNF gamma beta induced activities see Example 15 suggests that DR3 and or DR3 V1 polynucleotides and polypeptides are useful as inhibitors of TNF gamma beta function.

In a specific embodiment nucleic acids comprising sequences encoding antibodies or functional derivatives thereof are administered to treat inhibit and or prevent a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression and or activity of a polypeptide of the invention by way of gene therapy. Gene therapy refers to therapy performed by the administration to a subject of an expressed or expressible nucleic acid. In this embodiment of the invention the nucleic acids produce their encoded protein that mediates a therapeutic effect.

Any of the methods for gene therapy available in the art can be used according to the present invention. Exemplary methods are described below.

For general reviews of the methods of gene therapy see Goldspiel et al. 12 488 505 1993 Wu and Wu 3 87 95 1991 Tolstoshev 32 573 596 1993 Mulligan 260 926 932 1993 and Morgan and Anderson 62 191 217 1993 May 1993 TIBTECH 11 5 155 215. Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can be used are described in Ausubel et al. eds. 1993 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons NY and Kriegler 1990 Gene Transfer and Expression A Laboratory Manual Stockton Press NY.

In a preferred aspect the compound comprises nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody said nucleic acid sequences being part of expression vectors that express the antibody or fragments or chimeric proteins or heavy or light chains thereof in a suitable host. In particular such nucleic acid sequences have promoters operably linked to the antibody coding region said promoter being inducible or constitutive and optionally tissue specific. In another particular embodiment nucleic acid molecules are used in which the antibody coding sequences and any other desired sequences are flanked by regions that promote homologous recombination at a desired site in the genome thus providing for intrachromosomal expression of the antibody nucleic acids Koller and Smithies 1989 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 8932 8935 Zijlstra et al. 1989 Nature 342 435 438 . In specific embodiments the expressed antibody molecule is a single chain antibody alternatively the nucleic acid sequences include sequences encoding both heavy and light chains or fragments thereof of the antibody.

Delivery of the nucleic acids into a patient may be either direct in which case the patient is directly exposed to the nucleic acid or nucleic acid carrying vectors or indirect in which case cells are first transformed with the nucleic acids in vitro then transplanted into the patient. These two approaches are known respectively as in vivo or ex vivo gene therapy.

In a specific embodiment the nucleic acid sequences are directly administered in vivo where it is expressed to produce the encoded product. This can be accomplished by any of numerous methods known in the art e.g. by constructing them as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that they become intracellular e.g. by infection using defective or attenuated retrovirals or other viral vectors see U.S. Pat. No. 4 980 286 or by direct injection of naked DNA or by use of microparticle bombardment e.g. a gene gun BIOLISTIC DUPONT or coating with lipids or cell surface receptors or transfecting agents encapsulation in liposomes microparticles or microcapsules or by administering them in linkage to a peptide which is known to enter the nucleus by administering it in linkage to a ligand subject to receptor mediated endocytosis see e.g. Wu and Wu 1987262 4429 4432 which can be used to target cell types specifically expressing the receptors etc. In another embodiment nucleic acid ligand complexes can be formed in which the ligand comprises a fusogenic viral peptide to disrupt endosomes allowing the nucleic acid to avoid lysosomal degradation. In yet another embodiment the nucleic acid can be targeted in vivo for cell specific uptake and expression by targeting a specific receptor see e.g. PCT Publications WO 92 06180 dated Apr. 16 1992 Wu et al. WO 92 22635 dated Dec. 23 1992 Wilson et al. WO92 20316 dated Nov. 26 1992 Findeis et al. WO93 14188 dated Jul. 22 1993 Clarke et al. WO 93 20221 dated Oct. 14 1993 Young . Alternatively the nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression by homologous recombination Koller and Smithies 86 8932 8935 1989 Zijlstra et al. 342 435 438 1989 .

In a specific embodiment viral vectors that contains nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody of the invention are used. For example a retroviral vector can be used see Miller et al. 217 581 599 1993 . These retroviral vectors have been to delete retroviral sequences that are not necessary for packaging of the viral genome and integration into host cell DNA. The nucleic acid sequences encoding the antibody to be used in gene therapy are cloned into one or more vectors which facilitates delivery of the gene into a patient. More detail about retroviral vectors can be found in Boesen et al. 6 291 302 1994 which describes the use of a retroviral vector to deliver the mdr1 gene to hematopoietic stem cells in order to make the stem cells more resistant to chemotherapy. Other references illustrating the use of retroviral vectors in gene therapy are Clowes et al. 93 644 651 1994 Kiem et al. 83 1467 1473 1994 Salmons and Gunzberg 4 129 141 1993 and Grossman and Wilson 3 110 114 1993 .

Adenoviruses are other viral vectors that can be used in gene therapy. Adenoviruses are especially attractive vehicles for delivering genes to respiratory epithelia. Adenoviruses naturally infect respiratory epithelia where they cause a mild disease. Other targets for adenovirus based delivery systems are liver the central nervous system endothelial cells and muscle. Adenoviruses have the advantage of being capable of infecting non dividing cells. Kozarsky and Wilson 3 499 503 1993 present a review of adenovirus based gene therapy. Bout et al. 5 3 10 1994 demonstrated the use of adenovirus vectors to transfer genes to the respiratory epithelia of rhesus monkeys. Other instances of the use of adenoviruses in gene therapy can be found in Rosenfeld et al. 252 431 434 1991 Rosenfeld et al. 68 143 155 1992 Mastrangeli et al. 91 225 234 1993 PCT Publication WO94 12649 and Wang et al. 2 775 783 1995 . In a preferred embodiment adenovirus vectors are used.

Adeno associated virus AAV has also been proposed for use in gene therapy Walsh et al. 204 289 300 1993 U.S. Pat. No. 5 436 146 .

Another approach to gene therapy involves transferring a gene to cells in tissue culture by such methods as electroporation lipofection calcium phosphate mediated transfection or viral infection. Usually the method of transfer includes the transfer of a selectable marker to the cells. The cells are then placed under selection to isolate those cells that have taken up and are expressing the transferred gene. Those cells are then delivered to a patient.

In this embodiment the nucleic acid is introduced into a cell prior to administration in vivo of the resulting recombinant cell. Such introduction can be carried out by any method known in the art including but not limited to transfection electroporation microinjection infection with a viral or bacteriophage vector containing the nucleic acid sequences cell fusion chromosome mediated gene transfer microcell mediated gene transfer spheroplast fusion etc. Numerous techniques are known in the art for the introduction of foreign genes into cells see e.g. Loeffler and Behr 217 599 618 1993 Cohen et al. 217 618 644 1993 Cline 29 69 92 1985 and may be used in accordance with the present invention provided that the necessary developmental and physiological functions of the recipient cells are not disrupted. The technique should provide for the stable transfer of the nucleic acid to the cell so that the nucleic acid is expressible by the cell and preferably heritable and expressible by its cell progeny.

The resulting recombinant cells can be delivered to a patient by various methods known in the art. Recombinant blood cells e.g. hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells are preferably administered intravenously. The amount of cells envisioned for use depends on the desired effect patient state etc. and can be determined by one skilled in the art.

Cells into which a nucleic acid can be introduced for purposes of gene therapy encompass any desired available cell type and include but are not limited to epithelial cells endothelial cells keratinocytes fibroblasts muscle cells hepatocytes blood cells such as T lymphocytes B lymphocytes monocytes macrophages neutrophils eosinophils megakaryocytes granulocytes various stem or progenitor cells in particular hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells e.g. as obtained from bone marrow umbilical cord blood peripheral blood fetal liver etc.

In an embodiment in which recombinant cells are used in gene therapy nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody are introduced into the cells such that they are expressible by the cells or their progeny and the recombinant cells are then administered in vivo for therapeutic effect. In a specific embodiment stem or progenitor cells are used. Any stem and or progenitor cells which can be isolated and maintained in vitro can potentially be used in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention see e.g. PCT Publication WO 94 08598 dated Apr. 28 1994 Stemple and Anderson 71 973 985 1992 Rheinwald 21A 229 1980 and Pittelkow and Scott 61 771 1986 .

In a specific embodiment the nucleic acid to be introduced for purposes of gene therapy comprises an inducible promoter operably linked to the coding region such that expression of the nucleic acid is controllable by controlling the presence or absence of the appropriate inducer of transcription.

The invention provides methods of treatment inhibition and prophylaxis by administration to a subject of an effective amount of a compound or pharmaceutical composition of the invention. In a preferred aspect the compound is substantially purified e.g. substantially free from substances that limit its effect or produce undesired side effects . The subject is preferably an animal including but not limited to animals such as cows pigs horses chickens cats dogs etc. and is preferably a mammal and most preferably human.

Formulations and methods of administration that can be employed when the compound comprises a nucleic acid or an immunoglobulin are described above additional appropriate formulations and routes of administration can be selected from among those described herein below.

The agonist or antagonists described herein can be administered in vitro ex vivo or in vivo to cells which express the receptor of the present invention.

By administration of an effective amount of an agonist or antagonist is intended an amount of the compound that is sufficient to enhance or inhibit a cellular response to a TNF family ligand and include polypeptides. In particular by administration of an effective amount of an agonist or antagonists is intended an amount effective to enhance or inhibit DR3 V1 or DR3 mediated apoptosis. Of course where apoptosis is to be enhanced an agonist according to the present invention can be co administered with a TNF family ligand. One of ordinary skill will appreciate that effective amounts of an agonist or antagonist can be determined empirically and may be employed in pure form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt ester or prodrug form. The agonist or antagonist may be administered in compositions in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.

It will be understood that when administered to a human patient the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon factors well known in the medical arts.

As a general proposition the total pharmaceutically effective amount of a DR3 polypeptide administered parenterally per dose will be in the range of about 1 g kg day to 10 mg kg day of patient body weight although as noted above this will be subject to therapeutic discretion. More preferably this dose is at least 0.01 mg kg day and most preferably for humans between about 0.01 and 1 mg kg day for the hormone. If given continuously the DR3 agonists or antagonists is typically administered at a dose rate of about 1 g kg hour to about 50 g kg hour either by 1 4 injections per day or by continuous subcutaneous infusions for example using a mini pump. An intravenous bag solution may also be employed.

Dosing may also be arranged in a patient specific manner to provide a predetermined concentration of an agonist or antagonist in the blood as determined by the RIA technique. Thus patient dosing may be adjusted to achieve regular on going trough blood levels as measured by RIA on the order of from 50 to 1000 ng ml preferably 150 to 500 ng ml.

Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer a compound of the invention e.g. encapsulation in liposomes microparticles microcapsules recombinant cells capable of expressing the compound receptor mediated endocytosis see e.g. Wu and Wu 262 4429 4432 1987 construction of a nucleic acid as part of a retroviral or other vector etc. Methods of introduction include but are not limited to intradermal intramuscular intraperitoneal intravenous subcutaneous intranasal epidural and oral routes. The compounds or compositions may be administered by any convenient route for example by infusion or bolus injection by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings e.g. oral mucosa rectal and intestinal mucosa etc. and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local. In addition it may be desirable to introduce the pharmaceutical compounds or compositions of the invention into the central nervous system by any suitable route including intraventricular and intrathecal injection intraventricular injection may be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter for example attached to a reservoir such as an Ommaya reservoir. Pulmonary administration can also be employed e.g. by use of an inhaler or nebulizer and formulation with an aerosolizing agent.

Pharmaceutical compositions are provided comprising an agonist or antagonist and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient which may be administered orally rectally parenterally intracistemally intravaginally intraperitoneally topically as by powders ointments drops or transdermal patch bucally or as an oral or nasal spray. Importantly by co administering an agonist and a TNF family ligand clinical side effects can be reduced by using lower doses of both the ligand and the agonist. It will be understood that the agonist can be co administered either before after or simultaneously with the TNF family ligand depending on the exigencies of a particular therapeutic application. By pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is meant a non toxic solid semisolid or liquid filler diluent encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. The term parenteral as used herein refers to modes of administration which include intravenous intramuscular intraperitoneal intrasternal subcutaneous and intraarticular injection and infusion.

Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention for parenteral injection can comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions dispersions suspensions or emulsions as well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use.

In addition to soluble DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptides DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptide containing the transmembrane region can also be used when appropriately solubilized by including detergents such as CHAPS or NP 40 with buffer.

In a specific embodiment it may be desirable to administer the pharmaceutical compounds or compositions of the invention locally to the area in need of treatment this may be achieved by for example and not by way of limitation local infusion during surgery topical application e.g. in conjunction with a wound dressing after surgery by injection by means of a catheter by means of a suppository or by means of an implant said implant being of a porous non porous or gelatinous material including membranes such as sialastic membranes or fibers. Preferably when administering a protein including an antibody of the invention care must be taken to use materials to which the protein does not absorb.

In another embodiment the compound or composition can be delivered in a vesicle in particular a liposome see Langer 249 1527 1533 1990 Treat et al. in Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer Lopez Berestein and Fidler eds.

In yet another embodiment the compound or composition can be delivered in a controlled release system. In one embodiment a pump may be used see Langer supra Sefton 198714 201 Buchwald et al. 1980 Surgery 88 507 Saudek et al. 1989321 574 .

In yet another embodiment a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the therapeutic target i.e. the brain thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose see e.g. Goodson in Medical Applications of Controlled Release supra vol. 2 pp. 115 138 1984 .

In a specific embodiment where the compound of the invention is a nucleic acid encoding a protein the nucleic acid can be administered in vivo to promote expression of its encoded protein by constructing it as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that it becomes intracellular e.g. by use of a retroviral vector see U.S. Pat. No. 4 980 286 or by direct injection or by use of microparticle bombardment e.g. a gene gun BIOLISTIC DUPONT or coating with lipids or cell surface receptors or transfecting agents or by administering it in linkage to a homeobox like peptide which is known to enter the nucleus see e.g. Joliot et al. 88 1864 1868 1991 etc. Alternatively a nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression by homologous recombination.

The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions. Such compositions comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In a specific embodiment the term pharmaceutically acceptable means approved by a regulatory of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals and more particularly in humans. The term carrier refers to a diluent adjuvant excipient or vehicle with which the therapeutic is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids such as water and oils including those of petroleum animal vegetable or synthetic origin such as peanut oil soybean oil mineral oil sesame oil and the like. Water is a preferred carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch glucose lactose sucrose gelatin malt rice flour chalk silica gel sodium stearate glycerol monostearate talc sodium chloride dried skim milk glycerol propylene glycol water ethanol and the like. The composition if desired can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents or pH buffering agents. These compositions can take the form of solutions suspensions emulsion tablets pills capsules powders sustained release formulations and the like. The composition can be formulated as a suppository with traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides. Oral formulation can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol lactose starch magnesium stearate sodium saccharine cellulose magnesium carbonate etc. Examples of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences by E. W. Martin. Such compositions will contain a therapeutically effective amount of the compound preferably in purified form together with a suitable amount of carrier so as to provide the form for proper administration to the patient. The formulation should suit the mode of administration.

The compounds of the invention can be formulated as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those formed with anions such as those derived from hydrochloric phosphoric acetic oxalic tartaric acids etc. and those formed with cations such as those derived from sodium potassium ammonium calcium ferric hydroxides isopropylamine triethylamine 2 ethylamino ethanol histidine procaine etc.

The amount of the compound of the invention which will be effective in the treatment inhibition and or prevention of a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression and or activity of a polypeptide of the invention can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition in vitro assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration and the seriousness of the disease or disorder and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient s circumstances. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.

For antibodies the dosage administered to a patient is typically 0.1 mg kg to 100 mg kg of the patient s body weight. Preferably the dosage administered to a patient is between 0.1 mg kg and 20 mg kg of the patient s body weight more preferably 1 mg kg to 10 mg kg of the patient s body weight. Generally human antibodies have a longer half life within the human body than antibodies from other species due to the immune response to the foreign polypeptides. Thus lower dosages of human antibodies and less frequent administration is often possible. Further the dosage and frequency of administration of antibodies of the invention may be reduced by enhancing uptake and tissue penetration e.g. into the brain of the antibodies by modifications such as for example lipidation.

In a preferred embodiment the composition is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous administration to human beings. Typically compositions for intravenous administration are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer.

Generally the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form for example as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the composition is administered by injection an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.

The compounds or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are preferably tested in vitro and then in vivo for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity prior to use in humans. For example in vitro assays to demonstrate the therapeutic or prophylactic utility of a compound or pharmaceutical composition include the effect of a compound on a cell line or a patient tissue sample. The effect of the compound or composition on the cell line and or tissue sample can be determined utilizing techniques known to those of skill in the art including but not limited to rosette formation assays and cell lysis assays.

Labeled antibodies and derivatives and analogs thereof which specifically bind to a polypeptide of interest can be used for diagnostic purposes to detect diagnose or monitor diseases and or disorders associated with the aberrant expression and or activity of a polypeptide of the invention. The invention provides for the detection of aberrant expression of a polypeptide of interest comprising a assaying the expression of the polypeptide of interest in cells or body fluid of an individual using one or more antibodies specific to the polypeptide interest and b comparing the level of gene expression with a standard gene expression level whereby an increase or decrease in the assayed polypeptide gene expression level compared to the standard expression level is indicative of aberrant expression.

The invention provides a diagnostic assay for diagnosing a disorder comprising a assaying the expression of the polypeptide of interest in cells or body fluid of an individual using one or more antibodies specific to the polypeptide interest and b comparing the level of gene expression with a standard gene expression level whereby an increase or decrease in the assayed polypeptide gene expression level compared to the standard expression level is indicative of a particular disorder. With respect to cancer the presence of a relatively high amount of transcript in biopsied tissue from an individual may indicate a predisposition for the development of the disease or may provide a means for detecting the disease prior to the appearance of actual clinical symptoms. A more definitive diagnosis of this type may allow health professionals to employ preventative measures or aggressive treatment earlier thereby preventing the development or further progression of the cancer.

Antibodies of the invention can be used to assay protein levels in a biological sample using classical immunohistological methods known to those of skill in the art e.g. see Jalkanen M. et al. 101 976 985 1985 Jalkanen M. et al. 105 3087 3096 1987 . Other antibody based methods useful for detecting protein gene expression include immunoassays such as the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA and the radioimmunoassay RIA . Suitable antibody assay labels are known in the art and include enzyme labels such as glucose oxidase radioisotopes such as iodine I I carbon C sulfur S tritium H indium In and technetium Tc luminescent labels such as luminol and fluorescent labels such as fluorescein and rhodamine and biotin.

One aspect of the invention is the detection and diagnosis of a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression of a polypeptide of the interest in an animal preferably a mammal and most preferably a human. In one embodiment diagnosis comprises a administering for example parenterally subcutaneously or intraperitoneally to a subject an effective amount of a labeled molecule which specifically binds to the polypeptide of interest b waiting for a time interval following the administering for permitting the labeled molecule to preferentially concentrate at sites in the subject where the polypeptide is expressed and for unbound labeled molecule to be cleared to background level c determining background level and d detecting the labeled molecule in the subject such that detection of labeled molecule above the background level indicates that the subject has a particular disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression of the polypeptide of interest. Background level can be determined by various methods including comparing the amount of labeled molecule detected to a standard value previously determined for a particular system.

It will be understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging system used will determine the quantity of imaging moiety needed to produce diagnostic images. In the case of a radioisotope moiety for a human subject the quantity of radioactivity injected will normally range from about 5 to 20 millicuries of 99 mTc. The labeled antibody or antibody fragment will then preferentially accumulate at the location of cells that contain the specific protein. In vivo tumor imaging is described in S. W. Burchiel et al. Immunopharmacokinetics of Radiolabeled Antibodies and Their Fragments. Chapter 13 in Tumor Imaging The Radiochemical Detection of Cancer S. W. Burchiel and B. A. Rhodes eds. Masson Publishing Inc. 1982 .

Depending on several variables including the type of label used and the mode of administration the time interval following the administration for permitting the labeled molecule to preferentially concentrate at sites in the subject and for unbound labeled molecule to be cleared to background level is 6 to 48 hours or 6 to 24 hours or 6 to 12 hours. In another embodiment the time interval following administration is 5 to 20 days or 5 to 10 days.

In an embodiment monitoring of the disease or disorder is carried out by repeating the method for diagnosing the disease or disease for example one month after initial diagnosis six months after initial diagnosis one year after initial diagnosis etc.

Presence of the labeled molecule can be detected in the patient using methods known in the art for in vivo scanning. These methods depend upon the type of label used. Skilled artisans will be able to determine the appropriate method for detecting a particular label. Methods and devices that may be used in the diagnostic methods of the invention include but are not limited to computed tomography CT whole body scan such as position emission tomography PET magnetic resonance imaging MRI and sonography.

After binding with specific antigen antibody to the reagent and removing unbound serum components by washing the reagent is reacted with reporter labeled anti human antibody to bind reporter to the reagent in proportion to the amount of bound anti antigen antibody on the solid support. The reagent is again washed to remove unbound labeled antibody and the amount of reporter associated with the reagent is determined. Typically the reporter is an enzyme which is detected by incubating the solid phase in the presence of a suitable fluorometric luminescent or colorimetric substrate Sigma St. Louis Mo. .

The solid surface reagent in the above assay is prepared by known techniques for attaching protein material to solid support material such as polymeric beads dip sticks 96 well plate or filter material. These attachment methods generally include non specific adsorption of the protein to the support or covalent attachment of the protein typically through a free amine group to a chemically reactive group on the solid support such as an activated carboxyl hydroxyl or aldehyde group. Alternatively streptavidin coated plates can be used in conjunction with biotinylated antigen s .

Thus the invention provides an assay system or kit for carrying out this diagnostic method. The kit generally includes a support with surface bound recombinant antigens and a reporter labeled anti human antibody for detecting surface bound anti antigen antibody.

The DNA sequence encoding the mature DR3 V1 protein in the cDNA contained in ATCC No. 97456 is amplified using PCR oligonucleotide primers specific to the amino terminal sequences of the DR3 V1 protein and to vector sequences 3 to the gene. Additional nucleotides containing restriction sites to facilitate cloning are added to the 5 and 3 sequences respectively.

The following primers are used for expression of DR3 extracellular domain in . The 5 primer 5 GCGCCATGGGGGCCCGGCGGCAG 3 SEQ ID NO 7 contains an NcoI site and 15 nucleotide starting from 290 nucleotide to 304 in SEQ ID NO 1. The 3 primer 5 GCGAAGCTTCTAGGACCCAGAACATCTGCC 3 SEQ ID NO 8 contains a HindIII site a stop codon and 18 nucleotides complimentary to nucleotides from 822 to 840 in SEQ ID NO 1. Vector is pQE60. The protein is not tagged.

The restriction sites are convenient to restriction enzyme sites in the bacterial expression vector pQE60 which are used for bacterial expression in these examples. Qiagen Inc. 9259 Eton Avenue Chatsworth Calif. 91311 . pQE60 encodes ampicillin antibiotic resistance Amp and contains a bacterial origin of replication ori an IPTG inducible promoter a ribosome binding site RBS .

The amplified DR3 V1 DNA and the vector pQE60 both are digested with NcoI and HindIII and the digested DNAs are then ligated together. Insertion of the DDCR protein DNA into the restricted pQE60 vector places the DR3 V1 protein coding region downstream of and operably linked to the vector s IPTG inducible promoter and in frame with an initiating AUG appropriately positioned for translation of DR3 V1 protein.

The ligation mixture is transformed into competent cells using standard procedures. Such procedures are described in Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning a Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. 1989 . strain M15 rep4 containing multiple copies of the plasmid pREP4 which expresses lac repressor and confers kanamycin resistance Kan is used in carrying out the illustrative example described herein. This strain which is only one of many that are suitable for expressing DR3 V1 protein is available commercially from Qiagen.

Transformants are identified by their ability to grow on LB plates in the presence of ampicillin and kanamycin. Plasmid DNA is isolated from resistant colonies and the identity of the cloned DNA confirmed by restriction analysis.

Clones containing the desired constructs are grown overnight O N in liquid culture in LB media supplemented with both ampicillin 100 g ml and kanamycin 25 g ml .

The O N culture is used to inoculate a large culture at a dilution of approximately 1 100 to 1 250. The cells are grown to an optical density at 600 nm OD600 of between 0.4 and 0.6. Isopropyl D thiogalactopyranoside IPTG is then added to a final concentration of 1 mM to induce transcription from lac repressor sensitive promoters by inactivating the lacI repressor. Cells subsequently are incubated further for 3 to 4 hours. Cells then are harvested by centrifugation and disrupted by standard methods. Inclusion bodies are purified from the disrupted cells using routine collection techniques and protein is solubilized from the inclusion bodies into 8M Urea. The 8M Urea solution containing the solubilized protein is passed over a PD 10 column in 2 phosphate buffered saline PBS thereby removing the urea exchanging the buffer and refolding the protein. The protein is purified by a further step of chromatography to remove endotoxin. Then it is sterile filtered. The sterile filtered protein preparation is stored in 2 PBS at a concentration of 95 ml.

Most of the vectors used for the transient expression of a given gene sequence in mammalian cells carry the SV40 origin of replication. This allows the replication of the vector to high copy numbers in cells e.g. COS cells that express the T antigen required for the initiation of viral DNA synthesis. Any other mammalian cell line can also be utilized for this purpose.

A typical mammalian expression vector contains the promoter element which mediates the initiation of transcription of mRNA the protein coding sequence and signals required for the termination of transcription and polyadenylation of the transcript. Additional elements include enhancers Kozak sequences and intervening sequences flanked by donor and acceptor sites for RNA splicing. Highly efficient transcription can be achieved with the early and late promoters from SV40 the long terminal repeats LTRs from Retroviruses e.g. RSV HTLVI HIVI and the early promoter of the cytomegalovirus CMV . However also cellular signals can be used e.g. human actin promoter . Suitable expression vectors for use in practicing the present invention include for example vectors such as pSVL and pMSG Pharmacia Uppsala Sweden pRSVcat ATCC 37152 pSV2dhfr ATCC 37146 and pBC12MI ATCC 67109 . Mammalian host cells that could be used include human HeLa 283 H9 and Jurkat cells mouse NIH3T3 and C127 cells Cos 1 Cos 7 and CV1 African green monkey cells quail QC1 3 cells mouse L cells and Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells.

Alternatively a gene of interest can be expressed in stable cell lines that contain the gene integrated into a chromosome. The co transfection with a selectable marker such as dhfr gpt neomycin hygromycin allows the identification and isolation of the transfected cells.

The transfected gene can also be amplified to express large amounts of the encoded protein. The DHFR dihydrofolate reductase is a useful marker to develop cell lines that carry several hundred or even several thousand copies of the gene of interest. Using this marker the mammalian cells are grown in increasing amounts of methotrexate for selection and the cells with the highest resistance are selected. These cell lines contain the amplified gene s integrated into a chromosome. Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells are often used for the production of proteins.

The expression vectors pC1 and pC4 contain the strong promoter LTR of the Rous Sarcoma Virus Cullen et al. 438 44701 March 1985 plus a fragment of the CMV enhancer Boshart et al. 41 521 530 1985 . Multiple cloning sites e.g. with the restriction enzyme cleavage sites BamHI XhaI and Asp718 facilitate the cloning of the gene of interest. The vectors contain in addition the 3 intron the polyadenylation and termination signal of the rat preproinsulin gene.

The expression plasmid pDR3 V1 HA is made by cloning a cDNA encoding DR3 V1 ATCC No. 97456 into the expression vector pcDNAI Amp which can be obtained from Invitrogen Inc. . Expression plasmid DR3HA is made by cloning a cDNA encoding DR3 ATCC No. 97757 into the expression vector pcDNAI Amp.

The expression vector pcDNAI amp contains 1 an origin of replication effective for propagation in and other prokaryotic cell 2 an ampicillin resistance gene for selection of plasmid containing prokaryotic cells 3 an SV40 origin of replication for propagation in eukaryotic cells 4 a CMV promoter a polylinker an SV40 intron and a polyadenylation signal arranged so that a cDNA conveniently can be placed under expression control of the CMV promoter and operably linked to the SV40 intron and the polyadenylation signal by means of restriction sites in the polylinker.

A DNA fragment encoding the entire DR3 V1 or Dr3 precursor and a HA tag fused in frame to its 3 end is cloned into the polylinker region of the vector so that recombinant protein expression is directed by the CMV promoter. The HA tag corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein described by Wilson et al. 37 767 1984 . The fusion of the HA tag to the target protein allows easy detection of the recombinant protein with an antibody that recognizes the HA epitope.

The DR3 V1 or DR3 cDNA of the deposit cDNA is amplified using primers that contained convenient restriction sites much as described above regarding the construction of expression vectors for expression of DR3 V1 or DR3 in and

To facilitate detection purification and characterization of the expressed DR3 V1 or DR3 one of the primers contains a hemagglutinin tag HA tag as described above.

Suitable primers for DR3 V1 include the following which are used in this example the 5 primer 5 CGCGCCATCATGGAGGAGACGCAGCAG 3 SEQ ID NO 9 contains the underlined BamHI site an ATG start codon and 5 codons thereafter.

Suitable primers for DR3 include the following which are used in this example the 5 primer 5 CGCGCCATCATGGAGCAGCGGCCGCGG 3 SEQ ID NO 10 contains the underlined BamHI site an ATG start codon and 5 codons thereafter.

The 3 primer for both DR3 and DR3 V1 containing the underlined XbaI site stop codon hemagglutinin tag and last 14 nucleotide of 3 coding sequence at the 3 end has the following sequence 5 GCGTCAAAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGG TACGGGCCGCGCTGCA 3 SEQ ID NO 11 .

The PCR amplified DNA fragment and the vector pcDNAI Amp are digested with BamHI and XbaI and then ligated. The ligation mixture is transformed into strain SURE available from Stratagene Cloning Systems 11099 North Torrey Pines Road La Jolla Calif. 92037 the transformed culture is plated on ampicillin media plates which then are incubated to allow growth of ampicillin resistant colonies. Plasmid DNA is isolated from resistant colonies and examined by restriction analysis and gel sizing for the presence of the DR3 V1 or DR3 encoding fragment.

For expression of recombinant DR3 V1 or DR3 COS cells are transfected with an expression vector as described above using DEAE DEXTRAN as described for instance in Sambrook et al. Cold Spring Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. 1989 .

Expression of the DR3 V1 HA fusion protein or the DR3HA fusion protein is detected by radiolabelling and immunoprecipitation using methods described in for example Harlow et al. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. 1988 . To this end two days after transfection the cells are labeled by incubation in media containing S cysteine for 8 hours. The cells and the media are collected and the cells are washed and then lysed with detergent containing RIPA buffer 150 mM NaCl 1 NP 40 0.1 SDS 1 NP 40 0.5 DOC 50 mM TRIS pH 7.5 as described by Wilson et al. cited above. Proteins are precipitated from the cell lysate and from the culture media using an HA specific monoclonal antibody. The precipitated proteins are analyzed by SDS PAGE gels and autoradiography. An expression product of the expected size is seen in the cell lysate which is not seen in negative controls.

The vector pC1 is used for the expression of DR3 V1 or DR3 ATCC No. 97456 or ATCC No. 97757 respectively protein. Plasmid pC1 is a derivative of the plasmid pSV2 dhfr ATCC Accession No. 37146 . Both plasmids contain the mouse DHFR gene under control of the SV40 early promoter. Chinese hamster ovary or other cells lacking dihydrofolate activity that are transfected with these plasmids can be selected by growing the cells in a selective medium alpha minus MEM LIFE TECHNOLOGIES supplemented with the chemotherapeutic agent methotrexate. The amplification of the DHFR genes in cells resistant to methotrexate MTX has been well documented see e.g. F. W. Alt et al. 253 1357 1370 1978 J. L. Hamlin and C. Ma 1097 107 143 1990 M. J. Page and M. A. Sydenham 9 64 68 1991 . Cells grown in increasing concentrations of MTX develop resistance to the drug by overproducing the target enzyme DHFR as a result of amplification of the DHFR gene. If a second gene is linked to the DHFR gene it is usually co amplified and over expressed. It is state of the art to develop cell lines carrying more than 1 000 copies of the genes. Subsequently when the methotrexate is withdrawn cell lines contain the amplified gene integrated into the chromosome s .

Plasmid pC1 contains for the expression of the gene of interest a strong promoter of the long terminal repeat LTR of the Rous Sarcoma Virus Cullen et al. 5 438 447 March 1985 plus a fragment isolated from the enhancer of the immediate early gene of human cytomegalovirus CMV Boshart et al. 41 521 530 1985 . Downstream from the promoter are the following single restriction enzyme cleavage sites that allow the integration of the genes BamHI followed by the 3 intron and the polyadenylation site of the rat preproinsulin gene. Other high efficient promoters can also be used for the expression e.g. the human actin promoter the SV40 early or late promoters or the long terminal repeats from other retroviruses e.g. HIV and HTLVI. For the polyadenylation of the mRNA other signals e.g. from the human growth hormone or globin genes can be used as well.

Stable cell lines carrying a gene of interest integrated into the chromosomes can also be selected upon co transfection with a selectable marker such as gpt G418 or hygromycin. It is advantageous to use more than one selectable marker in the beginning e.g. G418 plus methotrexate.

The plasmid pC1 is digested with the restriction enzyme BamHI and then dephosphorylated using calf intestinal phosphates by procedures known in the art. The vector is then isolated from a 1 agarose gel.

The DNA sequence encoding DR3 V1 or DR3 in the deposited cDNA is amplified using PCR oligonucleotide primers specific to the amino acid carboxyl terminal sequence of the DR3 V1 or DR3 protein and to vector sequences 3 to the gene. Additional nucleotides containing restriction sites to facilitate cloning are added to the 5 and 3 sequences respectively.

The 5 oligonucleotide primer for DR3 V1 has the sequence 5 CGCGCCATCATGGAGGAGACGCAGCAG 3 SEQ ID NO 12 containing the underlined BamHI restriction site which encodes a start AUG followed by the Kozak sequence and 18 nucleotides of the DR3 V1 coding sequence set out in SEQ ID NO 1 beginning with the first base of the ATG codon.

The 5 oligonucleotide primer for DR3 has the sequence 5 CGCGCC ATCATGGAGCAGCGGCCGCGG 3 SEQ ID NO 13 containing the underlined BamHI restriction site which encodes a start AUG followed by the Kozak sequence and 18 nucleotides of the DR3 coding sequence set out in SEQ ID NO 3 beginning with the first base of the ATG codon.

The 3 primer for both DR3 and DR3 V1 has the sequence 5 CGCTCACGGGCCGCGCTGCA 3 SEQ ID NO 14 containing the underlined BamHI restriction site followed by 17 nucleotides complementary to the last 14 nucleotides of the DR3 V1 or DR3 coding sequence set out in SEQ ID NO 1 or SEQ ID NO 3 respectively plus the stop codon.

The amplified DR3 or DR3 V1 DNA and the vector pC1 both are digested with BamHI and the digested DNAs then ligated together. Insertion of the DR3 V1 or DR3 DNA into the BamHI restricted vector placed the DR3 V1 or DR3 coding region downstream of and operably linked to the vector s promoter. The sequence of the inserted gene is confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Chinese hamster ovary cells lacking an active DHFR enzyme are used for transfection. 5 g of the expression plasmid C1 are cotransfected with 0.5 g of the plasmid pSVneo using the lipofection method Felgner et al. supra . The plasmid pSV2 neo contains a dominant selectable marker the gene neo from Tn5 encoding an enzyme that confers resistance to a group of antibiotics including G418. The cells are seeded in alpha minus MEM supplemented with 1 mg ml G418. After 2 days the cells are trypsinized and seeded in hybridoma cloning plates Greiner Germany and cultivated from 10 14 days. After this period single clones are trypsinized and then seeded in 6 well petri dishes using different concentrations of methotrexate 25 nM 50 nM 100 nM 200 nM 400 nM . Clones growing at the highest concentrations of methotrexate are then transferred to new 6 well plates containing even higher concentrations of methotrexate 500 nM 1 M 2 M 5 M . The same procedure is repeated until clones grow at a concentration of 100 M.

The vector pA2 is used to express the DR3 V1 or DR3 protein in the baculovirus expression system using standard methods such as those described in Summers et al. Texas Agricultural Experimental Station Bulletin No. 1555 1987 . This expression vector contains the strong polyhedron promoter of the Autograph californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus ACMNPV followed by convenient restriction sites. For an easy selection of recombinant virus the galactosidase gene from is inserted in the same orientation as the polyhedron promoter and is followed by the polyadenylation signal of the polyhedron gene. The polyhedron sequences are flanked at both sides by viral sequences for cell mediated homologous recombination with wild type viral DNA to generate viable virus that express the cloned polynucleotide.

Many other baculovirus vectors could be used in place of pA2 such as pAc373 pVL941 and pAcIM1 provided as those of skill readily will appreciate that construction provides appropriately located signals for transcription translation trafficking and the like such as an in frame AUG and a signal peptide as required. Such vectors are described in Luckow et al. 170 31 39 1989 among others.

The plasmid is digested with the restriction enzymes BamHI and XhaI and then is dephosphorylated using calf intestinal phosphatase using routine procedures known in the art. The DNA is then isolated from a 1 agarose gel using a commercially available kit GENECLEAN BIO 101 Inc. La Jolla Calif. . This vector DNA is designated herein V2 .

Fragment F2 and the dephosphorylated plasmid V2 are ligated together with T4 DNA ligase. HB101 cells are transformed with ligation mix and spread on culture plates. Bacteria are identified that contain the plasmid with the human DDCR gene by digesting DNA from individual colonies using BamHI and XhaI and then analyzing the digestion product by gel electrophoresis. The sequence of the cloned fragment is confirmed by DNA sequencing. This plasmid is designated herein pBac DR3 V1 or pBac DR3.

5 g of the plasmid pBac DR3 V1 or pBac DR3 is co transfected with 1.0 g of a commercially available linearized baculovirus DNA BaculoGold baculovirus DNA Pharmingen San Diego Calif. using the lipofection method described by Felgner et al. 84 7413 7417 1987 . 1 g of BaculoGold virus DNA and 5 g of the plasmid pBac DR3 V1 are mixed in a sterile well of a microliter plate containing 50 l of serum free Grace s medium Life Technologies Inc. Gaithersburg Md. . Afterwards 10 l LIPOFECTIN plus 90 l Grace s medium are added mixed and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Then the transfection mixture is added drop wise to Sf9 insect cells ATCC CRL 1711 seeded in a 35 mm tissue culture plate with 1 ml Grace s medium without serum. The plate is rocked back and forth to mix the newly added solution. The plate is then incubated for 5 hours at 27 C. After 5 hours the transfection solution is removed from the plate and 1 ml of Grace s insect medium supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum is added. The plate is put back into an incubator and cultivation is continued at 27 C. for four days.

After four days the supernatant is collected and a plaque assay is performed as described by Summers and Smith cited above. An agarose gel with Blue Gal Life Technologies Inc. Gaithersburg is used to allow easy identification and isolation of gal expressing clones which produce blue stained plaques. A detailed description of a plaque assay of this type can also be found in the user s guide for insect cell culture and baculovirology distributed by Life Technologies Inc. Gaithersburg page 9 10 .

Four days after serial dilution the virus is added to the cells. After appropriate incubation blue stained plaques are picked with the tip of an Eppendorf pipette. The agar containing the recombinant viruses is then resuspended in an Eppendorf tube containing 200 l of Grace s medium. The agar is removed by a brief centrifugation and the supernatant containing the recombinant baculovirus is used to infect Sf9 cells seeded in 35 mm dishes. Four days later the supernatants of these culture dishes are harvested and then they are stored at 4 C. A clone containing properly inserted DR3 V1 or DR3 is identified by DNA analysis including restriction mapping and sequencing. This is designated herein as V DR3 V1 or V DR3.

Gaithersburg . 42 hours later 5 Ci of S methionine and 5 Ci S cysteine available from Amersham are added. The cells are further incubated for 16 hours and then they are harvested by centrifugation lysed and the labeled proteins are visualized by SDS PAGE and autoradiography.

TF274 a stromal cell line exhibiting osteoblastic features was generated from the bone marrow of a healthy male donor Z. Jonak and K. B. Tan unpublished . Primary carotid artery endothelial cells were purchased from Clonetics Corp. San Diego Calif. and monocytes were prepared by differential centrifugation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and adhesion to tissue culture dish. CD19 CD4 and CD8 cells 90 pure were isolated with cell type specific immunomagnetic beads Drynal Lake Success N.Y. .

Total RNA of adult tissues were purchased from Clonetech Palo Alto Calif. . Total RNA was extracted from cell lines in exponential growth phase and primary cells with TriReagent Molecular Research Center Inc. Cincinnati Ohio . 5 to 7.5 g of total RNA was fractionated in a 1 agarose gel containing formaldehyde cast in a Wide Mini Sub Cell gel tray Bio Rad Hercules Calif. as described Sambrook et al with slight modifications. The formaldehyde concentration was reduced to 0.5M and the RNA was stained prior to electrophoresis with 100 g ml of ethidium bromide that was added to the loading buffer. After electrophoresis with continuous buffer recirculation 60 volts 90 min the gel was photographed and the RNA was transferred quantitatively to Zeta probe nylon membrane Biorad Hercules Calif. by vacuum blotting with 25 mM NaOH for 90 min. After neutralization for 5 10 min with 1M Tris HCl pH 7.5 containing 3M NaCl the blots were prehybridized with 50 formamide 8 dextran sulfate 6 SSPE 0.1 SDS and 100 g ml of sheared and denatured salmon sperm DNA for at least 30 min at 42 C. cDNA inserts labeled with P dCTP by random priming Stratagene La Jolla Calif. were denatured with 0.25M NaOH 10 min at 37 C. and added to the prehybridization solution. After 24 65 hr at 42 C. the blots were washed under high stringency conditions Sambrook et al. and exposed to X ray films.

Expression of DR3 was assessed by Northern blot in the following cell lines TF274 bone marrow stromal MG63 TE85 osteosarcoma K562 erythroid KG1a KG1 PLB985 HL60 U937 TNHP 1 myeloid REH BJAB Raji IM 9 B cell Sup Ti Jurkat H9 Molt 3 T cell RL95 2 endometrial carcinoma MCF 7 breast cancer BE HT29 colon cancer IMR32 neuroblastoma and could only be detected in KG1a cells. DR3 expression was detected in several lymphoblast cell lines. In the purified human hematopoietic cell populations DR3 was weakly expressed in CD19 cells and more highly expressed in monocytes. However the highest levels were observed in T cells CD4 or CD8 upon stimulation with PMA and PHA indicating that DR3 probably plays a role in the regulation of T cell activation.

In vitro and in vivo binding studies were undertaken to investigate DR3 signaling pathways. Since DR3 contains a death domain the inventors postulated that DR3 like TNFR 1 and Fas APO 1 may transduce signals by recruiting death domain containing adapter molecules DAMs such as FADD TRADD and RIP.

In vitro binding experiments were performed as described previously A. M. Chinnaiyan et al. 81 505 12 1995 M. P. Boldin et al. 270 7795 8 1995 F. C. Kischkel et al. 14 5579 5588 1995 .

Briefly the cytoplasmic domains of DR3 amino acid residues 215 393 SEQ ID NO 4 and the death domain mutant DR3 amino acid residues 215 321 SEQ ID NO 4 were amplified by PCR using appropriate templates and primers into pGSTag. pGSTag and pGSTag TNFR 1 were described previously A. M. Chinnaiyan et al. 81 505 12 1995 M. P. Boldin et al. 270 7795 8 1995 F. C. Kischkel et al. 14 5579 5588 1995 . GST and GST fusion proteins were prepared from strain BL21 DE3 pLysS using standard published procedures and the recombinant proteins immobilized onto glutathione agarose beads.

Hsu et al. 4 387 396 1996 as template. Following translation equal amounts of total S labeled reticulocyte lysate were diluted into 150 l GST binding buffer 50 mM Tris pH 7.6 120 mM NaCl 1 NP 40 and incubated for 2 hrs. at 4 C. with the various GST fusion proteins complexed to beads following the beads were pelleted by plus centrifugation washed three times in GST buffer boiled in SDS sample buffer and resolved on a 12.5 SDS PAGE. Bound proteins were visualized following autoradioraphy at 80 C. In vitro translated S labeled RIP TRADD and FADD were incubated with glutathione beads containing GST alone or GST fusions of the cytoplasmic domain of Fas TNFR 1 DR3 215 393 or DDR3 215 321 . After the beads were washed retained proteins were analyzed by SDS PAGE and autoradiography. The gel was Coomassie stained to monitor equivalency of loading.

To demonstrate the association of DR3 and TRADD in vivo constructs encoding Flag TNFR 1 and Flag TNFR 1 were used. The Flag TNFR 1 and Flag TNFR 1 constructs were described elsewhere A. M. Chinnaiyan et al. 271 4961 4965 1996 . The constructs encoding Flag TNFR 1 and Flag TNFR 1 were described elsewhere A. M. Chinnaiyan et al. 271 4961 4965 1996 . To facilitate epitope tagging DR3 and DR3 1 321 were cloned into the IBI Kodak FLAG plasmid pCMV1FLAG utilizing the signal peptide provided by the vector. 293 cells 2 10 100 mm plate were grown in DMEM media containing 10 heat inactivated fetal bovine serum containing penicillin G streptomycin glutamine and non essential amino acids. Cells were transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation with the constructs encoding the indicated proteins in combination with pcDNA3 CrmA M. Tewari et al. 270 3255 60 1995 to prevent cell death and thus maintain protein expression. Cells were lysed in 1 ml lysis buffer 50 mM Hepes 150 mM NaCl 1 mM EDTA 1 NP 40 and a protease inhibitor cocktail . Lysates were immunoprecipitated with a control monoclonal antibody or anti Flag antibody for at least 4 hrs at 4 C. as previously described A. M. Chinnaiyan et al. 271 4961 4965 1996 . The beads were washed with lysis buffer 3 but in the case of TRADD binding the NaCl concentration was adjusted to 1M. The precipitates were fractioned on 12.5 SDS PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Subsequent Western blotting was performed as described elsewhere H. Hsu et al. 84 299 308 1996 A. M. Chinnaiyan et al. 271 4961 4965 1996 . After 24 32 hours extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitated with a control monoclonal antibody or anti Flag monoclonal antibody IBI Kodak . Western analysis indicated that myc TRADD and death receptor expression levels were similar in all samples. Coprecipitating myc TRADD was detected by immunoblotting using an anti myc HRP conjugated antibody Boehringer Mannheim .

As an initial screen in vitro translated radiolabeled DAMs were precipitated with various glutathione S transferase GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione Sepharose beads. As predicted from previous studies A. M. Chinnaiyan et al. 81 505 12 1995 M. P. Boldin et al. 270 7795 8 1995 F. C. Kischkel et al. EMBO 14 5579 5588 1995 H. Hsu et al. 81 495 504 1995 FADD associated with the GST Fas cytoplasmic domain while TRADD associated with the GST TNFR 1 cytoplasmic domain. In addition there was a direct albeit weak interaction between RIP and GST TNFR 1. Interestingly GST DDCR associated specifically with TRADD but not FADD or RIP. Furthermore a truncated death domain mutant of DR3 GST DDR3 failed to interact with TRADD. To demonstrate the association of DR3 and TRADD in vivo 293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids that direct the synthesis of myc epitope tagged TRADD myc TRADD and Flag epitope tagged DR3 Flag DR3 Flag TNFR 1 or mutants. Consistent with the in vitro binding study TRADD specifically coprecipitated with DR3 and TNFR 1 but not with the death domain mutants DDR3 and DTNFR 1. Thus it appears that DR3 like TNFR 1 may activate downstream signaling cascades by virtue of its ability to recruit the adapter molecule TRADD.

Overexpression of TRADD induces apoptosis and NF kB activation two of the most important activities signaled by TNFR 1 H. Hsu et al. supra . Upon oligomerization of TNFR 1 by trimeric TNF TRADD is recruited to the receptor signaling complex H. Hsu et al. 84 299 308 1996 . TRADD can then recruit the following signal transducing molecules 1 TRAF2 a TNFR 2 and CD40 associated molecule M. Rothe et al. 78 681 92 1994 M. Rothe et al. 269 1424 1427 1995 that mediates NF kB activation 2 RIP originally identified as a Fas APO 1 interacting protein by two hybrid analysis B. Z. Stanger et al. 81 513 23 1995 that mediates NF kB activation and apoptosis H. Hsu et al. 4 387 396 1996 and 3 FADD a Fas APO 1 associated molecule that mediates apoptosis A. M. Chinnaiyan et al. 81 505 12 1995 M. P. Boldin et al. 270 7795 8 1995 F. C. Kischkel et al. 14 5579 5588 1995 . Thus the inventors demonstrate that RIP TRAF2 and FADD could be co immunoprecipitated with DR3. In 293 cells expressing DR3 and RIP only a weak association could be detected between the two molecules. However in the presence of TRADD RIP association with DR3 was significantly enhanced. Likewise very little TRAF2 directly co precipitated with DR3 in 293 cells. However when DR3 and TRAF2 were expressed in the presence of TRADD and RIP both of which can bind TRAF2 an enhanced binding of TRAF2 to DR3 could be detected. A similar association between FADD and DR3 was also observed. In the presence of TRADD FADD efficiently co precipitated with DR3.

Previous studies demonstrated that FADD could recruit the ICE CED 3 like protease FLICE to the Fas APO 1 death inducing signaling complex M. Muzio et al. 85 817 827 1996 M. P. Boldin et al. 85 803 815 1996 . To demonstrate that FLICE can associate with TNFR 1 and DR3 co precipitation experiments in 293 cells were carried out. Interestingly FLICE was found complexed to TNFR 1 and DR3. Co transfection of TRADD and or FADD failed to enhance the FLICE TNFR 1 DR3 interaction suggesting that endogenous amounts of these adapter molecules were sufficient to maintain this association.

Overexpression of Fas APO 1 and TNFR 1 in mammalian cells mimics receptor activation M. Muzio et al. 85 817 827 1996 M. P. Boldin et al. 85 803 815 1996 . Thus this system was utilized to study the functional role of DDCR. Ectopic expression of DR3 in MCF7 breast carcinoma cells and 293 human embryonic kidney cells induced rapid apoptosis.

Cell death assays were performed essentially as previously described A. M. Chinnaiyan et al. 81 505 12 1995 M. P. Boldin et al. 270 7795 8 1995 F. C. Kischkel et al. 14 5579 5588 1995 A. M. Chinnaiyan et al. 271 4961 4965 1996 . Briefly MCF 7 human breast carcinoma clonal cell lines stably transfected with either vector alone a CrmA expression construct M. Tewari et al. 270 3255 60 1995 or FADD DN expression construct A. M. Chinnaiyan et al. 271 4961 4965 1996 were transiently transfected with pCMV galatosidase in the presence of a ten fold excess of pcDNA3 expression constructs encoding the indicated proteins using lipofectamine GIBCO BRL . 293 cells were likewise transfected using the CaPOmethod. The ICE family inhibitor z VAD fmk Enzyme Systems Products Dublin Calif. was added to the cells at a concentration of 10 M 5 hrs after transfection. 32 hours following transfection cells were fixed and stained with X Gal as previously described A. M. Chinnaiyan et al. 81 505 12 1995 M. P. Boldin et al. 270 7795 8 1995 F. C. Kischkel et al. 14 5579 5588 1995 . The data mean SD shown are the percentage of round blue cells among the total number of blue cells counted. Data were obtained from at least three independent experiments.

NF kB luciferase assays were performed as described elsewhere H. Hsu et al. 4 387 396 1996 M. D. Adams et al. 377 3 174 1995 G. S. Feng et al. 271 12129 32 1996 M. Rothe et al. 78 681 92 1994 M. Rothe et al. 269 1424 1427 1995 A. M. Chinnaiyan et al. 271 4961 4965 1996 . Briefly 293 cells were co transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation with pCMV galactosidase E selectin luciferase reporter gene M. Rothe et al. 78 681 92 1994 M. Rothe et al. 269 1424 1427 1995 the indicated death receptors and the indicated dominant negative inhibitors. In addition DR3 or DDR3 was cotransfected with the pLantem expression construct GIBCO BRL which encodes green fluorescent protein photographic inset . Cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy using a FITC range barrier filter cube. Nuclei of transfected cells were visualized by DAPI staining and the image overlaid. Cell death assays were performed essentially as previously described Chinnaiyan et al. 81 505 12 1995 Boldin et al. 270 7795 8 1995 Kischkel et al. 14 5579 5588 1995 Chinnaiyan et al. 271 4961 4965 1996 . The dominant negative inhibitors were used at a 4 fold higher quantity than the death receptors. Total DNA was kept constant.

To show that DR3 induces NF kB activation which may be inhibited by RIP DN Stanger et al. 81 513 23 1995 and TRAF2 DN Hsu et al. 81 495 504 1995 Rothe et al. 78 681 92 1994 Rothe et al. 269 1424 1427 1995 293 cells were co transfected with the indicated molecules and an NF kB luciferase reporter plasmid Rothe et al. 78 681 92 1994 Rothe et al. 269 1424 1427 1995 and luciferase activities subsequently determined. NF B luciferase assays were performed as described elsewhere Hsu et al. 4 387 396 1996 Adams et al. 377 3 174 1995 Feng et al. 271 12129 32 1996 Rothe et al. 78 681 92 1994 Rothe et al. 269 1424 1427 1995 Chinnaiyan et al. 271 4961 4965 1996 . Briefly 293 cells were co transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation with pCMB galactosidase E selectin luciferase reporter gene Rothe et al. 78 681 92 1994 Rothe et al. 269 1424 1427 1995 the indicated death receptors and the indicated dominant negative inhibitors. The dominant negative inhibitors were used at a 4 fold higher quantity than the death receptors. Total DNA was kept constant. Representative experiment performed in duplicate three independent times mean SD .

The cells displayed morphological alterations typical of cells undergoing apoptosis becoming rounded condensed and detaching from the dish. In MCF7 cells plasmids encoding full length DR3 or DDR3 were co transfected with the pLantem reporter construct encoding green fluorescent protein. Nuclei of cells transfected with DR3 but not DDR3 exhibited apoptotic morphology as assessed by DAPI staining. Similar to TNFR 1 and Fas APO 1 M. Muzio et al. 85 817 827 1996 M. P. Boldin et al. 85 803 815 1996 M. Tewari et al. 270 3255 60 1995 DR3 induced apoptosis was blocked by the inhibitors of ICE like proteases CrmA and z VAD fmk. Importantly apoptosis induced by DR3 was also blocked by dominant negative versions of FADD FADD DN or FLICE FLICE DN MACHa1C360S which were previously shown to inhibit death signaling by Fas APO 1 and TNFR 1 M. Muzio et al. 85 817 827 1996 M. P. Boldin et al. 85 803 815 1996 H. Hsu et al. 84 299 398 1996 A. M. Chinnaiyan et al. 271 4961 4965 1996 . Thus FADD and the ICE like protease FLICE are likely necessary components of DR3 induced apoptosis.

As DR3 activation recruits three molecules implicated in TNF induced NF kB activation we examined whether DR3 could activate NF kB. Transfection of a control vector or expression of Fas APO 1 failed to induce NF kB activation. By contrast NF kB was activated by ectopic expression of DR3 or TNFR 1 but not by the inactive signaling mutants DDR3 or DTNFR 1. Importantly DR3 induced NF kB activation was blocked by dominant negative derivatives of RIP RIP DN and TRAF2 TRAF2 DN which were previously shown to abrogate TNF induced NF kB activation H. Hsu et al. 84 299 398 1996 H. Hsu et al. 4 387 396 1996 . As expected FADD DN did not interfere with DR3 mediated NF kB activation H. Hsu et al. 84 299 398 1996 A. M. Chinnaiyan et al. 271 4961 4965 1996 .

Thus the experiments set forth in Examples 6 and 7 demonstrate that DR3 is a death domain containing molecule capable of triggering both apoptosis and NF kB activation two pathways dominant in the regulation of the immune system. The experiments also demonstrate the internal signal transduction machinery of this novel cell death receptor. The DR3 signaling complex assembles in a hierarchical manner with the recruitment of the multivalent adapter molecule TRADD from which two distinct signaling cascades emanate 1 NF kB activation mediated by TRAF2 and RIP and 2 cell death mediated by FADD FLICE and RIP.

Another method of gene therapy according to the present invention involves operably associating the endogenous DR3 sequence with a promoter via homologous recombination as described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 670 issued Jun. 24 1997 International Publication Number WO 96 29411 published Sep. 26 1996 International Publication Number WO 94 12650 published Aug. 4 1994 Koller et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 8932 8935 1989 and Zijlstra et al. Nature 342 435 438 1989 . This method involves the activation of a gene which is present in the target cells but which is not expressed in the cells or is expressed at a lower level than desired. Polynucleotide constructs are made which contain a promoter and targeting sequences which are homologous to the 5 non coding sequence of endogenous DR3 flanking the promoter. The targeting sequence will be sufficiently near the 5 end of DR3 so the promoter will be operably linked to the endogenous sequence upon homologous recombination. The promoter and the targeting sequences can be amplified using PCR. Preferably the amplified promoter contains distinct restriction enzyme sites on the 5 and 3 ends. Preferably the 3 end of the first targeting sequence contains the same restriction enzyme site as the 5 end of the amplified promoter and the 5 end of the second targeting sequence contains the same restriction site as the 3 end of the amplified promoter.

The amplified promoter and the amplified targeting sequences are digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and subsequently treated with calf intestinal phosphatase. The digested promoter and digested targeting sequences are added together in the presence of T4 DNA ligase. The resulting mixture is maintained under conditions appropriate for ligation of the two fragments. The construct is size fractionated on an agarose gel then purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation.

In this Example the polynucleotide constructs are administered as naked polynucleotides via electroporation. However the polynucleotide constructs may also be administered with transfection facilitating agents such as liposomes viral sequences viral particles precipitating agents etc. Such methods of delivery are known in the art.

Once the cells are transfected homologous recombination will take place resulting in the promoter being operably linked to the endogenous DR3 sequence. This results in the expression of DR3 V1 or DR3 in the cell. Expression may be detected by immunological staining or any other method known in the art.

Fibroblasts are obtained from a subject by skin biopsy. The resulting tissue is placed in DMEM 10 fetal calf serum. Exponentially growing or early stationary phase fibroblasts are trypsinized and rinsed from the plastic surface with nutrient medium. An aliquot of the cell suspension is removed for counting and the remaining cells are subjected to centrifugation. The supernatant is aspirated and the pellet is resuspended in 5 ml of electroporation buffer 20 mM HEPES pH 7.3 137 mM NaCl 5 mM KCl 0.7 mM Na2 HPO4 6 mM dextrose . The cells are recentrifuged the supernatant aspirated and the cells resuspended in electroporation buffer containing 1 mg ml acetylated bovine serum albumin. The final cell suspension contains approximately 3 10cells ml. Electroporation should be performed immediately following resuspension.

Plasmid DNA is prepared according to standard techniques. For example to construct a plasmid for targeting to the DR3 locus plasmid pUC18 MBI Fermentas Amherst N.Y. is digested with HindIII. The CMV promoter is amplified by PCR with an XhaI site on the 5 end and a BamHI site on the 3 end. Two DR3 non coding sequences are amplified via PCR one DR3 non coding sequence DR3 fragment 1 is amplified with a HindIII site at the 5 end and an XhaI site at the 3 end the other DR3 non coding sequence DR3 fragment 2 is amplified with a BamHI site at the 5 end and a HindIII site at the 3 end. The CMV promoter and DR3 fragments are digested with the appropriate enzymes CMV promoter XhaI and BamHI DR3 fragment 1 XhaI DR3 fragment 2 BamHI and ligated together. The resulting ligation product is digested with HindIII and ligated with the HindIII digested pUC18 plasmid.

Plasmid DNA is added to a sterile cuvette with a 0.4 cm electrode gap Bio Rad . The final DNA concentration is generally at least 120 g ml. 0.5 ml of the cell suspension containing approximately 1.5 10cells is then added to the cuvette and the cell suspension and DNA solutions are gently mixed. Electroporation is performed with a Gene Pulser apparatus Bio Rad . Capacitance and voltage are set at 960 F and 250 300 V respectively. As voltage increases cell survival decreases but the percentage of surviving cells that stably incorporate the introduced DNA into their genome increases dramatically. Given these parameters a pulse time of approximately 14 20 mSec should be observed.

Electroporated cells are maintained at room temperature for approximately 5 minutes and the contents of the cuvette are then gently removed with a sterile transfer pipette. The cells are added directly to 10 ml of prewarmed nutrient media DMEM with 15 calf serum in a 10 cm dish and incubated at 37 C. The following day the media is aspirated and replaced with 10 ml of fresh media and incubated for a further 16 24 hours.

The engineered fibroblasts are then injected into the host either alone or after having been grown to confluence on cytodex 3 microcarrier beads. The fibroblasts now produce the protein product. The fibroblasts can then be introduced into a patient as described above.

The antibodies of the present invention can be prepared by a variety of methods. See Ausubel et al. eds. 1998 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons NY Chapter 2. As one example of such methods cells expressing DR3 V1 or DR3 are administered to an animal to induce the production of sera containing polyclonal antibodies. In a preferred method a preparation of DR3 V1 or DR3 protein is prepared and purified to render it substantially free of natural contaminants. Such a preparation is then introduced into an animal in order to produce polyclonal antisera of greater specific activity.

Monoclonal antibodies specific for protein DR3 V1 or DR3 are prepared using hybridoma technology. Kohler et al. Nature 256 495 1975 Kohler et al. 6 511 1976 Kohler et al. 6 292 1976 Hammerling et al. in Monoclonal Antibodies and T Cell Hybridomas Elsevier N.Y. pp. 563 681 1981 . In general an animal preferably a mouse is immunized with DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptide or more preferably with a secreted DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptide expressing cell. Such polypeptide expressing cells are cultured in any suitable tissue culture medium preferably in Earle s modified Eagle s medium supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum inactivated at about 56 C. and supplemented with about 10 g l of nonessential amino acids about 1 000 U ml of penicillin and about 100 g ml of streptomycin.

The splenocytes of such mice are extracted and fused with a suitable myeloma cell line. Any suitable myeloma cell line may be employed in accordance with the present invention however it is preferable to employ the parent myeloma cell line SP20 available from the ATCC . After fusion the resulting hybridoma cells are selectively maintained in HAT medium and then cloned by limiting dilution as described by Wands et al. Gastroenterology 80 225 232 1981 . The hybridoma cells obtained through such a selection are then assayed to identify clones which secrete antibodies capable of binding the DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptide.

Alternatively additional antibodies capable of binding to DR3 V1 or DR3 polypeptide can be produced in a two step procedure using anti idiotypic antibodies. Such a method makes use of the fact that antibodies are themselves antigens and therefore it is possible to obtain an antibody which binds to a second antibody. In accordance with this method protein specific antibodies are used to immunize an animal preferably a mouse. The splenocytes of such an animal are then used to produce hybridoma cells and the hybridoma cells are screened to identify clones which produce an antibody whose ability to bind to the DR3 V1 or DR3 protein specific antibody can be blocked by DR3 V1 or DR3. Such antibodies comprise anti idiotypic antibodies to the DR3 V1 or DR3 protein specific antibody and are used to immunize an animal to induce formation of further DR3 V1 or DR3 protein specific antibodies.

For in vivo use of antibodies in humans an antibody is humanized . Such antibodies can be produced using genetic constructs derived from hybridoma cells producing the monoclonal antibodies described above. Methods for producing chimeric and humanized antibodies are known in the art and are discussed infra. See for review Morrison 229 1202 1985 Oi et al. 4 214 1986 Cabilly et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 Taniguchi et al. EP 171496 Morrison et al. EP 173494 Neuberger et al. WO 8601533 Robinson et al. WO 8702671 Boulianne et al. 312 643 1984 Neuberger et al. 314 268 1985 .

Naturally occurring V genes isolated from human PBLs are constructed into a large library of antibody fragments which contain reactivities against polypeptides of the present invention to which the donor may or may not have been exposed see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 885 793 incorporated herein in its entirety by reference .

A library of scFvs is constructed from the RNA of human PBLs as described in WO92 01047. To rescue phage displaying antibody fragments approximately 10harboring the phagemid are used to inoculate 50 ml of 2 TY containing 1 glucose and 100 g ml of ampicillin 2 TY AMP GLU and grown to an O.D. of 0.8 with shaking. Five ml of this culture is used to innoculate 50 ml of 2 TY AMP GLU 2 10TU of delta gene 3 helper phage M13 delta gene III see WO92 01047 are added and the culture incubated at 37 C. for 45 minutes without shaking and then at 37 C. for 45 minutes with shaking. The culture is centrifuged at 4000 r.p.m. for 10 minutes and the pellet resuspended in 2 liters of 2 TY containing 100 g ml ampicillin and 50 g ml kanamycin and grown overnight. Phages are prepared as described in WO92 01047.

M13 delta gene III is prepared as follows M13 delta gene III helper phage does not encode gene III protein hence the phage mid s displaying antibody fragments have a greater avidity of binding to antigen. Infectious M13 delta gene III particles are made by growing the helper phage in cells harboring a pUC19 derivative supplying the wild type gene III protein during phage morphogenesis. The culture is incubated for 1 hour at 37 C. without shaking and then for a further hour at 37 C. with shaking. Cells are pelleted IEC Centra 8 4000 revs min for 10 min resuspended in 300 ml 2 TY broth containing 100 g ampicillin ml and 25 g kanamycin ml 2 TY AMP KAN and grown overnight shaking at 37 C. Phage particles are purified and concentrated from the culture medium by two PEG precipitations Sambrook et al. 1990 resuspended in 2 ml PBS and passed through a 0.45 m filter Minisart NML Sartorius to give a final concentration of approximately 10transducing units ml ampicillin resistant clones .

Immunotubes Nunc are coated overnight in PBS with 4 ml of either 100 mg ml or 10 mg ml of a polypeptide of the present invention. Tubes are blocked with 2 Marvel PBS for 2 hours at 37 C. and then washed 3 times in PBS. Approximately 10TU of phage are applied to the tube and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature tumbling on an over and under turntable and then left to stand for another 1.5 hours. Tubes are washed 10 times with PBS 0.1 Tween 20 and 10 times with PBS. Phage are eluted by adding 1 ml of 100 mM triethylamine and rotating 15 minutes on an under and over turntable after which the solution is immediately neutralized with 0.5 ml of 1.0M Tris HCl pH 7.4. Phages are then used to infect 10 ml of mid log TG1 by incubating eluted phage with bacteria for 30 minutes at 37 C. The are then plated on TYE plates containing 1 glucose and 100 g ml ampicillin. The resulting bacterial library is then rescued with delta gene 3 helper phage as described above to prepare phage for a subsequent round of selection. This process is then repeated for a total of 4 rounds of affinity purification with tube washing increased to 20 times with PBS 0.1 Tween 20 and 20 times with PBS for rounds 3 and 4.

Eluted phage from the 3rd and 4th rounds of selection are used to infect HB 2151 and soluble scFv is produced Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 from single colonies for assay. ELISAs are performed with microtitre plates coated with either 10 pg ml of the polypeptide of the present invention in 50 mM bicarbonate pH 9.6. Clones positive in ELISA are further characterized by PCR fingerprinting see e.g. WO92 01047 and then by sequencing.

RNA is isolated from entire families or individual patients presenting with a phenotype of interest such as a disease . cDNA is then generated from these RNA samples using protocols known in the art. See Sambrook et al. 1990 The cDNA is then used as a template for PCR employing primers surrounding regions of interest in SEQ ID NO 1. Suggested PCR conditions consist of 35 cycles at 95 C. for 30 seconds 60 120 seconds at 52 58 C. and 60 120 seconds at 70 C. using buffer solutions described in Sidransky D. et al. 252 706 1991 .

PCR products are then sequenced using primers labeled at their 5 end with T4 polynucleotide kinase employing SequiTherm Polymerase. Epicentre Technologies . The intron exon borders of selected exons of DR3 are also determined and genomic PCR products analyzed to confirm the results. PCR products harboring suspected mutations in DR3 are then cloned and sequenced to validate the results of the direct sequencing.

PCR products of DR3 are cloned into T tailed vectors as described in Holton T. A. and Graham M. W. 19 1156 1991 and sequenced with T7 polymerase United States Biochemical . Affected individuals are identified by mutations in DR3 not present in unaffected individuals.

Genomic rearrangements are also observed as a method of determining alterations in the DR3 gene. Genomic clones isolated using techniques known in the art are nick translated with digoxigenindeoxy uridine 5 triphosphate Boehringer Manheim and FISH performed as described in Johnson C. et al. 35 73 99 1991 . Hybridization with the labeled probe is carried out using a vast excess of human cot 1 DNA for specific hybridization to the DR3 genomic locus.

Chromosomes are counterstained with 4 6 diamino 2 phenylindole and propidium iodide producing a combination of C and R bands. Aligned images for precise mapping are obtained using a triple band filter set Chroma Technology Brattleboro Vt. in combination with a cooled charge coupled device camera Photometrics Tucson Ariz. and variable excitation wavelength filters. Johnson C. et al. 8 75 1991 . Image collection analysis and chromosomal fractional length measurements are performed using the ISee Graphical Program System. Inovision Corporation Durham N.C. Chromosome alterations of the genomic region of DR3 hybridized by the probe are identified as insertions deletions and translocations. These DR3 alterations are used as a diagnostic marker for an associated disease.

DR3 polypeptides can be detected in a biological sample and if an increased or decreased level of DR3 is detected this polypeptide is a marker for a particular phenotype. Methods of detection are numerous and thus it is understood that one skilled in the art can modify the following assay to fit their particular needs.

For example antibody sandwich ELISAs are used to detect DR3 in a sample preferably a biological sample. Wells of a microtiter plate are coated with specific antibodies to DR3 at a final concentration of 0.2 to 10 g ml. The antibodies are either monoclonal or polyclonal and are produced using technique known in the art. The wells are blocked so that non specific binding of DR3 to the well is reduced.

The coated wells are then incubated for 2 hours at RT with a sample containing DR3. Preferably serial dilutions of the sample should be used to validate results. The plates are then washed three times with deionized or distilled water to remove unbounded DR3.

Next 50 l of specific antibody alkaline phosphatase conjugate at a concentration of 25 400 ng is added and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. The plates are again washed three times with deionized or distilled water to remove unbounded conjugate.

75 l of 4 methylumbelliferyl phosphate MUP or p nitrophenyl phosphate NPP substrate solution is then added to each well and incubated 1 hour at room temperature to allow cleavage of the substrate and fluorescence. Fluorescence is measured using a microtiter plate reader. A standard curve is prepared using the experimental results from serial dilutions of a control sample with the sample concentration plotted on the X axis log scale and fluorescence or absorbance on the Y axis linear scale . The DR3 polypeptide concentration in a sample is then interpolated using the standard curve based on the measured fluorescence of that sample.

The present invention relates to a method for treating an individual in need of a decreased level of DR3 biological activity in the body comprising administering to such an individual a composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of DR3 antagonist. Preferred antagonists for use in the present invention are DR3 specific antibodies.

Moreover it will be appreciated that conditions caused by a decrease in the standard or normal expression level of DR3 in an individual can be treated by administering DR3 preferably in a soluble and or secreted form. Thus the invention also provides a method of treatment of an individual in need of an increased level of DR3 polypeptide comprising administering to such an individual a pharmaceutical composition comprising an amount of DR3 to increase the biological activity level of DR3 in such an individual.

For example a patient with decreased levels of DR3 polypeptide receives a daily dose 0.1 100 g kg of the polypeptide for six consecutive days. Preferably the polypeptide is in a soluble and or secreted form.

The present invention also relates to a method for treating an individual in need of an increased level of DR3 biological activity in the body comprising administering to such an individual a composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of DR3 or an agonist thereof.

Antisense technology is used to inhibit production of DR3. This technology is one example of a method of decreasing levels of DR3 polypeptide preferably a soluble and or secreted form due to a variety of etiologies such as cancer.

For example a patient diagnosed with abnormally increased levels of DR3 is administered intravenously antisense polynucleotides at 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 and 3.0 mg kg day for 21 days. This treatment is repeated after a 7 day rest period if it is determined to be well tolerated.

One method of gene therapy transplants fibroblasts which are capable of expressing soluble and or mature DR3 polypeptides onto a patient. Generally fibroblasts are obtained from a subject by skin biopsy. The resulting tissue is placed in tissue culture medium and separated into small pieces. Small chunks of the tissue are placed on a wet surface of a tissue culture flask approximately ten pieces being placed in each flask. The flask is turned upside down closed tight and left at room temperature over night. After 24 hours at room temperature the flask is inverted and the chunks of tissue remain fixed to the bottom of the flask and fresh media e.g. Ham s F12 media with 10 FBS penicillin and streptomycin is added. The flasks are then incubated at 37 C. for approximately one week.

At this time fresh media is added and subsequently changed every several days. After an additional two weeks in culture a monolayer of fibroblasts emerge. The monolayer is trypsinized and scaled into larger flasks.

pMV 7 Kirschmeier P. T. et al. 7 219 25 1988 flanked by the long terminal repeats of the Moloney murine sarcoma virus is digested with EcoRI and HindIII and subsequently treated with calf intestinal phosphatase. The linear vector is fractionated on agarose gel and purified using glass beads.

The cDNA encoding DR3 can be amplified using PCR primers which correspond to the 5 and 3 end encoding sequences respectively. Preferably the 5 primer contains an EcoRI site and the 3 primer includes a HindIII site. Equal quantities of the Moloney murine sarcoma virus linear backbone and the amplified EcoRI and HindIII fragment are added together in the presence of T4 DNA ligase. The resulting mixture is maintained under conditions appropriate for ligation of the two fragments. The ligation mixture is then used to transform HB101 which are then plated onto agar containing kanamycin for the purpose of confirming that the vector contains properly inserted DR3.

The amphotropic pA317 or GP am12 packaging cells are grown in tissue culture to confluent density in Dulbecco s Modified Eagles Medium DMEM with 10 calf serum CS penicillin and streptomycin. The MSV vector containing the DR3 gene is then added to the media and the packaging cells transduced with the vector. The packaging cells now produce infectious viral particles containing the DR3 gene the packaging cells are now referred to as producer cells .

Fresh media is added to the transduced producer cells and subsequently the media is harvested from a 10 cm plate of confluent producer cells. The spent media containing the infectious viral particles is filtered through a Millipore filter to remove detached producer cells and this media is then used to infect fibroblast cells. Media is removed from a sub confluent plate of fibroblasts and quickly replaced with the media from the producer cells. This media is removed and replaced with fresh media. If the titer of virus is high then virtually all fibroblasts will be infected and no selection is required. If the titer is very low then it is necessary to use a retroviral vector that has a selectable marker such as neo or his. Once the fibroblasts have been efficiently infected the fibroblasts are analyzed to determine whether DR3 protein is produced.

The engineered fibroblasts are then transplanted onto the host either alone or after having been grown to confluence on cytodex 3 microcarrier beads.

Another aspect of the present invention is using in vivo gene therapy methods to treat disorders diseases and conditions. The gene therapy method relates to the introduction of naked nucleic acid DNA RNA and antisense DNA or RNA DR3 sequences into an animal to increase or decrease the expression of the DR3 polypeptide. The DR3 polynucleotide may be operatively linked to a promoter or any other genetic elements necessary for the expression of the DR3 polypeptide by the target tissue. Such gene therapy and delivery techniques and methods are known in the art see for example WO90 11092 WO98 11779 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 693 622 5 705 151 5 580 859 Tabata H. et al. 35 470 479 1997 Chao J. et al. 35 517 522 1997 Wolff J. A. 7 314 318 1997 Schwartz B. et al. 3 405 411 1996 Tsunmi Y. et al. 94 3281 3290 1996 incorporated herein by reference .

The DR3 polynucleotide constructs may be delivered by any method that delivers injectable materials to the cells of an animal such as injection into the interstitial space of tissues heart muscle skin lung liver intestine and the like . The DR3 polynucleotide constructs can be delivered in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid or aqueous carrier.

The term naked polynucleotide DNA or RNA refers to sequences that are free from any delivery vehicle that acts to assist promote or facilitate entry into the cell including viral sequences viral particles liposome formulations LIPOFECTIN or precipitating agents and the like. However the DR3 polynucleotides may also be delivered in liposome formulations such as those taught in Felgner P. et al. 772 126 139 1995 and Abdallah B. et al. 85 1 7 1995 which can be prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art.

The DR3 polynucleotide vector constructs used in the gene therapy method are preferably constructs that will not integrate into the host genome nor will they contain sequences that allow for replication. Any strong promoter known to those skilled in the art can be used for driving the expression of DNA. Unlike other gene therapy techniques one major advantage of introducing naked nucleic acid sequences into target cells is the transitory nature of the polynucleotide synthesis in the cells. Studies have shown that non replicating DNA sequences can be introduced into cells to provide production of the desired polypeptide for periods of up to six months.

The DR3 polynucleotide construct can be delivered to the interstitial space of tissues within an animal including of muscle skin brain lung liver spleen bone marrow thymus heart lymph blood bone cartilage pancreas kidney gall bladder stomach intestine testis ovary uterus rectum nervous system eye gland and connective tissue. Interstitial space of the tissues comprises the intercellular fluid mucopolysaccharide matrix among the reticular fibers of organ tissues elastic fibers in the walls of vessels or chambers collagen fibers of fibrous tissues or that same matrix within connective tissue ensheathing muscle cells or in the lacunae of bone. It is similarly the space occupied by the plasma of the circulation and the lymph fluid of the lymphatic channels. Delivery to the interstitial space of muscle tissue is preferred for the reasons discussed below. They may be conveniently delivered by injection into the tissues comprising these cells. They are preferably delivered to and expressed in persistent non dividing cells which are differentiated although delivery and expression may be achieved in non differentiated or less completely differentiated cells such as for example stem cells of blood or skin fibroblasts. In vivo muscle cells are particularly competent in their ability to take up and express polynucleotides.

For the naked DR3 polynucleotide injection an effective dosage amount of DNA or RNA will be in the range of from about 0.05 g kg body weight to about 50 mg kg body weight. Preferably the dosage will be from about 0.005 mg kg to about 20 mg kg and more preferably from about 0.05 mg kg to about 5 mg kg. Of course as the artisan of ordinary skill will appreciate this dosage will vary according to the tissue site of injection. The appropriate and effective dosage of nucleic acid sequence can readily be determined by those of ordinary skill in the art and may depend on the condition being treated and the route of administration. The preferred route of administration is by the parenteral route of injection into the interstitial space of tissues. However other parenteral routes may also be used such as inhalation of an aerosol formulation particularly for delivery to lungs or bronchial tissues throat or mucous membranes of the nose. In addition naked DR3 polynucleotide constructs can be delivered to arteries during angioplasty by the catheter used in the procedure.

The dose response effects of injected DR3 polynucleotide in muscle in vivo are determined as follows. Suitable DR3 template DNA for production of mRNA coding for DR3 polypeptide is prepared in accordance with a standard recombinant DNA methodology. The template DNA which may be either circular or linear is either used as naked DNA or complexed with liposomes. The quadriceps muscles of mice are then injected with various amounts of the template DNA.

Five to six week old female and male Balb C mice are anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with 0.3 ml of 2.5 Avertin. A 1.5 cm incision is made on the anterior thigh and the quadriceps muscle is directly visualized. The DR3 template DNA is injected in 0.1 ml of carrier in a 1 cc syringe through a 27 gauge needle over one minute approximately 0.5 cm from the distal insertion site of the muscle into the knee and about 0.2 cm deep. A suture is placed over the injection site for future localization and the skin is closed with stainless steel clips.

After an appropriate incubation time e.g. 7 days muscle extracts are prepared by excising the entire quadriceps. Every fifth 15 m cross section of the individual quadriceps muscles is histochemically stained for DR3 protein expression. A time course for DR3 protein expression may be done in a similar fashion except that quadriceps from different mice are harvested at different times. Persistence of DR3 DNA in muscle following injection may be determined by Southern blot analysis after preparing total cellular DNA and HIRT supernatants from injected and control mice. The results of the above experimentation in mice can be use to extrapolate proper dosages and other treatment parameters in humans and other animals using DR3 naked DNA.

The premyeloid cell line TF 1 was stably transfected with SRE SEAP ignal esponse lement ecreted lkaline hosphatase reporter plasmid that responds to the SRE signal transduction pathway. The TF 1 SRE reporter cells were treated with TNF gamma beta International Publication Numbers WO96 14328 WO00 66608 and WO00 08139 at 200 ng ml and showed activation response as recorded by the SEAP activity. This activity can be neutralized by A TNFR6 alpha Fc fusion protein hereinafter TR6.Fc in this example in a dose dependent manner. The TR6.Fc by itself in contrast showed no activity on the TF 1 SRE reporter cells. The results demonstrate that 1 TF 1 is a target cell for TNF gamma beta ligand activity and 2 TR6 interacts with TNF gamma beta and inhibits its activity on TF 1 cells.

Similarly the interaction of DR3 International Publication Numbers WO97 33904 and WO 0064465 and TNF gamma beta can be demonstrated using TF 1 SRE reporter cells. The results indicate that DR3.Fc interacts with TNF gamma beta either by competing naturally expressed DR3 on TF 1 cells or forming inactive TNF gamma beta DR3.fc complex or both. At least three additional pieces of evidence demonstrate an interaction between TNF gamma beta and DR3 and TR6. First both TR6.Fc and DR3.Fc are able to inhibit TNF gamma beta activation of NF B in 293T cells whereas in the same experiment TNFRI.Fc was not able to inhibit TNF gamma beta activation of NF B in 293T cells. Secondly both TR6.Fc and DR3.Fc can be used to immunoprecipitate TNF gamma beta. Thirdly TR6.Fc proteins can be detected by FACS analysis to specifically bind cells transfected with TNF gamma beta.

Members of the TNF and TNFR superfamilies of proteins are involved in the regulation of many important biological processes including development organogenesis innate and adaptive immunity Locksley et al. 104 487 501 2001 . Interaction of TNF ligands such as TNF Fas LIGHT and BLyS with their cognate receptor or receptors has been shown to affect the immune responses as they are able to activate signaling pathways that link them to the regulation of inflammation apoptosis homeostasis host defense and autoimmunity. The TNFR superfamily can be divided into two groups based on the presence of different domains in the intracellular portion of the receptor. One group contains a TRAF binding domain that enables them to couple to TRAFs TNFR associated factor these in turn activate a signaling cascade that results in the activation of NF B and initiation of transcription. The other group of receptors is characterized by a 60 amino acid globular structure named Death Domain DD . Historically death domain containing receptors have been described as inducers of apoptosis via the activation of caspases. These receptors include TNFR1 DR3 DR4 DR5 DR6 and Fas. More recent evidence Siegel et al. 1 469 474 2000 and references within has shown that some members of this subgroup of receptors such as Fas also have the ability to positively affect T cell activation. A third group of receptors has also been described. The members of this group that include DcR1 DcR2 OPG and TNFR 6 alpha also called DcR3 and hereinafter in this example referred to as TR6 have been named decoy receptors as they lack a cytoplasmic domain and may act as inhibitors by competing with the signal transducing receptor for the ligand Ashkenazi et al. 11 255 260 1999 . TR6 which exhibits closest homology to OPG associates with high affinity to FasL and LIGHT and inhibits FasL induced apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo Pitti et al. 396 699 703 1998 Yu et al. 274 13733 6 1999 Connolly et al. 298 25 33 2001 . Its role in down regulating immune responses was strongly suggested by the observation that TR6 supresses T cell responses against alloantigen Zhang et al. 107 1459 68 2001 and certain tumors overexpress TR6 Pitti et al. supra Bai et al. 97 1230 1235 2000 .

DR3 is a DD containing receptor that shows highest homology to TNFR1 Chinnaiyan et al. 274 990 2 1996 Kitson et al. 384 372 5 1996 Marsters et al. 6 1669 76 1996 Bodmer et al. 6 79 88 1997 Screaton et al. 94 4615 19 1997 Tan et al. 204 35 46 1997 . In contrast to TNFR1 which is ubiquitously expressed DR3 appears to be mostly expressed by lymphocytes and is efficiently induced following T cell activation. TWEAK Apo3L was previously shown to bind DR3 in vitro Marsters et al. 8 525 528 1998 . However more recent work raised doubt about this interaction and showed that TWEAK was able to induce NF B and caspase activation in cells lacking DR3 Schneider et al. 29 1785 92 1999 Kaptein et al. 485 135 141 2000 .

In this Example the characterization of the ligand TNF gamma beta also known as TL1 described in International Publication Numbers WO00 08139 and WO00 66608 which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties for both DR3 and TR6 DcR3 is described. TNF gamma beta is a longer variant of TNF gamma alpha also known as VEGI and TL1 described in International Publication Numbers WO96 14328 WO99 23105 WO00 08139 and WO00 66608 which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties which was previously identified as an endothelial derived factor that inhibited endothelial cell growth in vitro and tumor progression in vivo Tan et al. 204 35 46 1997 Zhai et al. 13 181 9 1999 Zhai et al. 82 131 6 1999 Yue et al. 274 1479 86 1999 . It was found that TNF gamma beta is the more abundant form than TNF gamma alpha and is upregulated by TNF and IL 1 . U.S. Pat. No. 5 876 969.

As shown herein the interaction between TNF gamma beta and DR3 in 293T cells and in the erythroleukemic line TF 1 results in activation of NF B and induction of caspase activity respectively. TR6 is able to inhibit these activities by competing with DR3 for TNF gamma beta. More importantly it was found that in vitro TNF gamma beta functions specifically on activated T cells to promote survival and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines IFN and GMCSF and it markedly enhances acute graft versus host reactions in mice.

To identify novel TNF like molecules a database of over three million human expressed sequence tag EST sequences was analyzed using the BLAST algorithm. Several EST clones with high homology to TNF like molecule 1 TNF gamma alpha Tan et al. 204 35 46 1997 Zhai et al. 13 181 9 1999 Yue et al. 274 1479 86 1999 were identified from endothelial cell cDNA libraries. Sequence analysis of these cDNA clones revealed a 2080 base pair bp insert encoding an open reading frame of 251 amino acids aa with two upstream in frame stop codons. The predicted protein lacks a leader sequence but contains a hydrophobic transmembrane domain near the N terminus and a carboxyl domain that shares 20 30 sequence similarity with other TNF family members. Interestingly the C terminal 151 aa of this protein residues 101 251 is identical to residues 24 to 174 of TNF gamma alpha whereas the amino terminal region shares no sequence similarity. The predicted extracellular receptor interaction domain of TNF gamma beta contains two potential N linked glycosylation sites and shows highest amino acid sequence identity to TNF 24.6 followed by FasL 22.9 and LT 22.2 . A 337 bp stretch of the TNF gamma beta cDNA containing most of the 5 untranslated region and the sequences encoding the first 70 amino acids of the TNF gamma beta protein matches a genomic clone on human chromosome 9 Genbank Accession AL390240 clone RP11 428F18 . Further analysis of the human genomic sequences reveals that TNF gamma alpha and TNF gamma beta are likely derived from the same gene. While TNF gamma beta is encoded by four putative exons similar to most TNF like molecules TNF gamma alpha is encoded by only the last exon and the extended N terminal intron region and therefore lacks a putative transmembrane domain and the first conserved sheet. Mouse and rat TNF gamma beta cDNAs isolated from normal kidney cDNAs each encode a 252 aa protein. The overall amino acid sequence homology between human and mouse and human and rat TNF gamma beta proteins is 63.7 and 66.1 respectively. Higher sequence homology was found in the predicted extracellular receptor interaction domains of which human and mouse share 71.8 and human and rat share 75.1 sequence identity. An 84.2 sequence identity is seen between the mouse and rat TNF gamma beta proteins.

Like most TNF ligands TNF gamma beta exists as a membrane bound protein and can also be processed into a soluble form when ectopically expressed. The N terminal sequence of soluble TNF gamma beta protein purified from full length TNF gamma beta transfected 293T cells was determined to be Leu 72.

TNF gamma beta is Predominantly Expressed by Endothelial Cells a More Abundant Form than TNF gamma alpha and is Inducible by TNF and IL 1 

To determine the expression pattern of TNF gamma beta TNF gamma beta specific primer and fluorescent probe were used for quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction TaqMan and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction RT PCR see Experimental Procedures below . TNF gamma beta is expressed predominantly by human endothelial cells including umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVEC adult dermal microvascular endothelial cells HMVEC Ad and uterus myometrial endothelial cells UtMEC Myo with highest expression seen in HUVEC. A 750 bp DNA fragment was readily amplified from these endothelial cells by RT PCR indicating the presence of full length TNF gamma beta transcripts. Very little expression was seen in human aortic endothelial cells HAEC or other human primary cells including adult dermal fibroblast NHDF Ad and HFL 1 aortic smooth muscle cells AoSMC skeletal muscle cells SkMC adult keratinocytes NHEK Ad tonsillar B cells T cells NK cells monocytes or dendritic cells. Consistent with these results TNF gamma beta RNA was detected in human kidney prostate stomach and low levels were seen in intestine lung and thymus but not in heart brain liver spleen or adrenal gland. No significant levels of TNF gamma beta mRNA in any of the cancer cell lines tested including 293T HeLa Jurkat Molt4 Raji IM9 U937 Caco 2 SK N MC HepG2 KS4 1 and GH4C were detected.

As the expression pattern of TNF gamma beta is very similar to that of TNF gamma alpha Tan et al. 204 35 46 1997 Zhai et al. 13 181 9 1999 the relative abundance of the two RNA species was analyzed using TNF gamma alpha and TNF gamma beta specific primers and fluorescence probes for conventional and quantitative RT PCR. More TNF gamma beta mRNA was detected than that of TNF gamma alpha using both methods. The amount of TNF gamma beta mRNA is at least 15 fold higher than that of TNF gamma alpha in the same RNA samples. To determine if TNF gamma beta mRNA levels were inducible HUVEC cells were stimulated with either TNF IL 1 PMA bFGF or IFN . PMA and IL 1 rapidly induced high levels of TNF gamma beta mRNA with a peak in expression reached at 6 hours after treatment. TNF was also able to induce TNF gamma beta mRNA but the time course of induction appeared to be delayed compared to PMA and IL 1 . In contrast bFGF and IFN did not significantly affect the expression of TNF gamma beta. TNF gamma beta protein levels in the supernatants of activated HUVEC cells were analyzed by ELISA and a similar profile of induction was observed.

To identify the receptor for TNF gamma beta we generated HEK293F stable transfectants expressing full length TNF gamma beta on the cell surface confirmed by Taqman and flow cytometric analysis using TNF gamma beta monoclonal antibody . These cells were used to screen the Fc fusion form of the extracellular domain of TNFR family members including TNFR1 Fas HveA DR3 DR4 DR5 DR6 DcR1 DcR2 TR6 OPG RANK AITR TACI CD40 and OX40. DR3 Fc and TR6 Fc bound efficiently to cells expressing TNF gamma beta but not to vector control transfected cells. In contrast HveA Fc and all the other receptors tested did not bind to the TNF gamma beta expressing cells. TR6 has been previously described as a decoy receptor Pitti et al. 396 699 703 1998 Yu et al. 274 13733 6 1999 capable of competing with Fas and HveA for binding of FasL and LIGHT respectively. Whether TR6 could compete with DR3 for TNF gamma beta binding was tested. When a 2 1 molar ratio of a non tagged form of TR6 and DR3 Fc were used no binding of DR3 Fc was detected on TNF gamma beta expressing cells. These results demonstrated that both DR3 and TR6 can bind to membrane bound form of the TNF gamma beta protein.

Whether TNF gamma beta protein could bind to membrane bound form of the receptor DR3 was tested. A FLAG tagged soluble form of the TL1 aa 72 251 protein was tested for binding of cells transiently transfected with different members of the TNFR family including TNFR2 LT R 4 1BB CD27 CD30 BCMA DR3 DR4 DR5 DR6 DcR1 DcR2 RANK HveA and AITR. Binding of FLAG TL1 to cells expressing full length or DD deleted DR3 but not to any of the other receptors tested was consistently detected demonstrating that TNF gamma beta interacts with membrane associated DR3. The small shift 30 seen when full length DR3 was used is likely due to the presence of low DR3 expressing cells while DR3 overexpressed cells undergone apoptosis.

Communoprecipitation studies were also performed to confirm that TNF gamma beta could specifically bind DR3 and TR6. Consistent with what we observed in FACS analysis we found that DR3 Fc and TR6 Fc specifically interacted with FLAG TNF gamma beta. In contrast Fas Fc or TACI Fc could not immunoprecipitate FLAG TNF gamma beta but efficiently bound their known ligands FLAG FasL and FLAG BlyS respectively.

To verify that the TNF gamma beta binding to DR3 and TR6 was specific and exhibited characteristics that were similar to those observed with other TNF family members to their cognate receptors a BIAcore analysis using a non tagged TNF gamma beta aa 72 251 protein purified from was performed. The kinetics of TNF gamma beta binding to DR3 Fc was determined using three different batches of the TNF gamma beta protein. The ka and kd values were found to be 6.39E 05 Msand 4.13E 03M respectively. The average Kd value was 6.45 0.2 nM. TNF gamma beta was also examined for its ability to bind to several other TNF related receptors HveA BCMA TACI and TR6 . In addition to DR3 only TR6 was found to have significant and specific binding to TNF gamma beta. The ka and kd values were 1.04E 06 Msand 1.9E 03 M respectively which gives a Kd of 1.8 nM. The specificity of binding of TL1 to DR3 Fc and TR6 Fc were confirmed by the competition of TNF gamma beta binding in the presence of excess soluble receptor Fc. These Kd values for binding of TNF gamma beta to DR3 Fc and TR6 Fc are comparable to those determined for other TNFR ligand interactions.

Previous reports have demonstrated that ectopic expression of DR3 results in the activation of the transcription factor NF B Chinnaiyan et al. 274 990 2 1996 Kitson et al. 384 372 5 1996 Marsters et al. 6 1669 76 1996 Bodmer et al. 6 79 88 1997 . TNF gamma beta induced signaling in a reconstituted system in 293T cells into which DR3 and a NF B SEAP reporter had been introduced by transient transfection was studied. To avoid spontaneous apoptosis or NF B activation accompanied with DR3 overexpression a limited amount of DR3 expression DNA that by itself minimally activated these pathways was used. Under these conditions cotransfection of cDNAs encoding full length or the soluble form of TNF gamma beta resulted in significant NF B activation. This signaling event was dependent on the ectopic expression of DR3 and the intactness of the DR3 death domain as TNF gamma beta alone or in combination with a DD deleted DR3 did not induce NF B activation in these cells. Cotransfection of DR3 with cDNAs encoding TNF gamma alpha full length or N terminal 24 aa truncated failed to induce NF B activation. A similar induction of NF B activity was observed when increasing amounts of recombinant TL1 protein aa 72 251 with or without FLAG tag were added to DR3 expressing cells. This induction of NF B was specifically inhibited by the addition of excess amount of DR3 Fc or TR6 Fc but not by the addition of Fas Fc or TNFR1 Fc. These results demonstrated that TNF gamma beta is a signaling ligand for DR3 that induces NF B activation and TR6 can specifically inhibit this event.

As DR3 expression is mostly restricted to the lymphocytes Chinnaiyan et al. 274 990 2 1996 Kitson et al. 384 372 5 1996 Marsters et al. 6 1669 76 1996 Bodmer et al. 6 79 88 1997 Screaton et al. 94 4615 19 1997 Tan et al. 204 35 46 1997 and is upregulated upon T cell activation we examined the biological activity of TNF gamma beta on T cells. Recombinant TNF gamma beta aa 72 251 protein was tested for its ability to induce proliferation of resting or costimulated T cells treated with amounts of anti CD3 and anti CD28 that are not sufficient to induce proliferation . In resting or costimulated T cells no significant increase in proliferation over background was observed. Interestingly cells that were previously treated with TNF gamma beta for 72 hours were able to proliferate significantly in the presence of IL 2 than cells without TNF gamma beta preincubation indicating that TNF gamma beta increases the IL 2 responsiveness of costimulated T cells.

As enhanced IL 2 responsiveness has been associated with increased IL 2 receptor expression and altered cytokine secretion it was of interest to assess these responses on costimulated T cells treated with TNF gamma beta. TNF gamma beta treatment indeed upregulated IL 2R CD25 and IL 2R CD 122 expression from these cells. The extent of the increase in IL 2 receptor expression is consistent with the moderate increase in IL 2 responsiveness compared with IL 2 itself. We next measured cytokine secretion from these cells and found that both IFN and GMCSF were significantly induced whereas IL 2 IL 4 IL 10 or TNF were not. This effect was mostly dependent on the T cell coactivator CD28 as treatment of the cells with anti CD3 and TNF gamma beta only minimally induced cytokine secretion. The effect that we observed on T cells was specifically mediated by TNF gamma beta as addition of monoclonal neutralizing antibody to TL1 or addition of DR3 Fc or TR6 Fc proteins was able to inhibit TNF gamma beta mediated IFN secretion. TNF gamma beta was also tested on a variety of primary cells including B cells NK cells and monocytes but no significant activity was detected suggesting a specific activity of TNF gamma beta on T cells.

Overexpression of DR3 in cell lines induces caspase activation Chinnaiyan et al. 274 990 2 1996 Kitson et al. 384 372 5 1996 Marsters et al. 6 1669 76 1996 Bodmer et al. 6 79 88 1997 . We tested whether TL1 could induce caspase activation in primary T cells. Purified T cells were activated with PHA and incubated with recombinant TNF gamma beta or FasL in the presence or absence of cycloheximide CHX . No induction of caspase activity was detected in TNF gamma beta treated T cells but was readily measured when cells were triggered with FasL suggesting that under this experimental condition TNF gamma beta does not activate caspases in T cells the assay we used detects activation of caspases 2 3 6 7 8 9 and 10 . Various cell lines for the expression of DR3 and found that the erythroleukimic cell line TF 1 expressed high levels of DR3 were then analyzed. The effect of recombinant TNF gamma beta protein on caspase activation in TF 1 cells was then measured. In the absence of cycloheximide no significant increase in caspase activity was detected following TNF gamma beta treatment while TNF gamma beta was able to efficiently induce caspase activation in the presence of cycloheximide. This effect was inhibited by either DR3 Fc or TR6 Fc protein but not by LIGHT Fc. An anti TNF gamma beta monoclonal antibody was also shown to completely inhibit this activity confirming that the caspase activation was mediated by TNF gamma beta.

To determine if the in vitro activities of TNF gamma beta could be reproduced in vivo a mouse model of acute graft versus host response GVHR was developed in which parental C57BL 6 splenocytes were injected intravenously into BALB c X C57 BL 6 F1 mice CB6 l and the recipient s immune responses were measured. Typical alloactivation results in increased splenic weight of the recipient mice and enhanced proliferation and cytokine production of the splenocytes cultured ex vivo Via 146 2603 9 1991 Zhang et al. 107 1459 68 2001 . The large number of T cells in the spleen and their expected upregulation of DR3 in response to alloactivation makes this an ideal model to assess the effect of TNF gamma beta on a defined in vivo immune response. Five day administration of 3 mg kg of the recombinant TNF gamma beta protein markedly enhanced the graft versus host responses. The mean n 4 weight of normal spleens obtained from naive CB6F1 mice was 0.091 g. Alloactivation resulted in a 2.5 fold increase in splenic weight 0.228 g . Treatment of allografted CB6F1 mice with recombinant TNF gamma beta protein aa 72 251 further increased splenic weight about 50 to a mean value of 0.349 g. TNF gamma beta treatment also significantly enhanced ex vivo splenocyte expansion and secretion of IFN and GMC SF. Thus TNF gamma beta strongly enhances GVHR in vivo and this effect is consistent with TNF gamma beta s in vitro activities.
