title: Method for fabricating selectively coupled optical waveguides on a substrate
abstract: A method for fabricating selectively coupled optical waveguides on a substrate is disclosed. Initially, a first layer of waveguide material is deposited on a substrate. The first layer of waveguide material is then etched to form multiple level one waveguides and fill shapes. A dielectric layer is deposited on top of the level one waveguides and fill shapes. The surface profile of the dielectric layer deposition tracks the pattern density of the fill shapes. After the surface of the dielectric layer has been polished, a second layer of waveguide material is deposited on the substrate. At least one optically coupled waveguide structure, which is formed by a first level one waveguide and a first level two waveguide, is located adjacent to at least one non-optically coupled waveguide structure, which is formed by a second level one waveguide and a second level two waveguide.

The present application claims benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. 365 to the previously filed international patent application number PCT US08 074786 filed on Aug. 29 2008 assigned to the assignee of the present application and having a priority date of Oct. 17 2007 based upon U.S. provisional patent application No. 60 999 235 the contents of both applications are incorporated herein by reference.

The invention claimed in this patent application was made with U.S. Government support under contract No. HR0011 05 C 0027 awarded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA . The U.S. Government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates to optical waveguides in general and in particular to a method for fabricating selectively coupled optical waveguides on a substrate.

Although optical waveguides can be fabricated in different layers of a substrate in a stack structure the difficulties in enabling all those optical waveguides to couple with one another can limit the usefulness of the stacked structure. In order for optical waveguides located in different layers to couple with each other the vertical distance between them must be a fraction of the optical wavelength and this distance is much smaller than the typical dielectric thickness required to isolate two layers.

The entire length of conventionally coupled waveguides are separated by a relatively thin dielectric layer having a uniform thickness. However the usage of one uniform dielectric thickness across the substrate as the coupling layer does not allow for optically isolating the optical waveguides. Thus the conventional method of utilizing a thin coupling layer limits the integration density of coupled waveguides due to the relatively large separation distances required to provide optical isolation from adjacent waveguides.

Consequently it would be desirable to provide an improved method for fabricating coupled optical waveguides such that optical coupling can be achieved within localized areas while adequate optical isolation from other waveguide structures located in close proximity can also be attained.

In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention a first layer of waveguide material is initially deposited on a substrate. The first layer of waveguide material is then etched to form multiple level one waveguides and fill shapes. A dielectric layer is deposited on top of the level one waveguides and fill shapes. The surface profile of the dielectric layer deposition tracks the pattern density of the fill shapes. After the surface of the dielectric layer has been polished a second layer of waveguide material is deposited on the substrate. At least one optically coupled waveguide structure which is formed by a first level one waveguide and a first level two waveguide is located adjacent to at least one non optically coupled waveguide structure which is formed by a second level one waveguide and a second level two waveguide.

All features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent in the following detailed written description.

Referring now to the drawings and in particular to there are illustrated sequential steps of a method for fabricating selectively coupled optical waveguides in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Initially a layer of waveguide material is deposited on a substrate . The waveguide material layer is then etched using conventional lithographic methods to form level one waveguides and fill shapes as shown in . Since waveguides and fill shapes are made of the same waveguide material they are essentially identical from each other even though they are shown in different colors except waveguides will actually be utilized to perform the functions of waveguides while fill shapes will only be served as spacers or fillers.

Next a dielectric layer such as silicon oxide silicon dioxide or cladding material is deposited over substrate covering waveguides and fill shapes as depicted in . The deposition surface profile of dielectric layer is determined by the pattern density of fill shapes . The pattern density of fill shapes is defined by the individual size of fill shapes the distances between fill shapes and the distances between fill shapes and waveguides 

For example in the deposition surface profile of dielectric layer directly above waveguide and fill shapes is relatively flat because of the larger sizes of waveguide and fill shapes as well as the close proximity among waveguide and fill shapes . The deposition surface profile of dielectric layer gradually slopes down from fill shape to waveguide because of the relatively smaller size of fill shape and the relatively longer distance between fill shape and waveguide . Similarly the deposition surface profile of dielectric layer directly above waveguide and fill shapes is relatively flat because of the larger sizes of waveguide and fill shapes as well as the close proximity among waveguide and fill shapes . The deposition surface profile of dielectric layer gradually slopes down from fill shape to waveguide because of the relatively smaller size of fill shape and the relatively longer distance between fill shape and waveguide

A chemical mechanical polishing CMP process is subsequently utilized to shave or thin out an area of dielectric layer located directly above waveguide as shown in . The exact removal amount of dielectric layer is determined by the pattern density of fill shapes and the CMP process.

A second waveguide material layer is deposited over dielectric layer . The second waveguide material layer is then patterned using conventional lithography method to produce level two waveguides as depicted in . In the present example area from of dielectric layer is thin enough to allow waveguide to be optically coupled to waveguide but the other areas of dielectric layer are much thicker such that waveguides are not optically coupled to waveguides . In addition adequate optical isolation are maintained between optically coupled waveguides and other waveguides and located in close proximity to optically coupled waveguides 

With reference now to there are illustrated the optional steps for decreasing the polishing load at the area of dielectric layer located directly over waveguide in . First dielectric layer is etched using a photo resist layer placed on dielectric layer as shown in . Photo resist layer is then stripped leaving a via in dielectric layer for waveguide deposition as depicted in . The optional steps are to be performed after and before .

As has been described the present invention provides an improved method for fabricating selectively coupled optical waveguides such that optical coupling can be achieved within localized areas while adequate optical isolation from other waveguide structures located in close proximity can also be attained.

While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
