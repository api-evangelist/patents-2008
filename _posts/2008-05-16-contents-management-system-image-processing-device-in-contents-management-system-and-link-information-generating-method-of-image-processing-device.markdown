This disclosure relates to a contents management system for managing contents by associating multimedia contents such as audio video information with a document that is viewed and edited by the user on a daily basis.

In recent years and continuing the development of electronic communication technology has facilitated the operation of interfacing consumer electronic products such as audio video equipment and PCs Personal Computers and delivering high volume data to a client PC via a telecommunication line e.g. a network . In such a technical background there are commercialized products and study examples for capturing video data with a camera and recording the video data in a PC and delivering the video data to a client PC via the Internet.

Among these examples there is a system that is attracting attention which is for accumulating the captured multimedia data in a DB database and delivering live data or on demand data according to a user s request. With this type of system it is possible to automatically create accurate meeting minutes including information that is not usually written down such as the decision making process detailed descriptions facial expressions of the attendants and vocal tones of the attendants. Under normal circumstances the person who is taking notes during a meeting may loose concentration which may lead to inaccuracies in the minutes. Furthermore there may be inconsistencies in the understanding and recognition of the contents of the minutes among the people concerned including those absent from the meeting . However this system prevents such disadvantages. As a result it is assumed that the intellectual productivity of the meeting can be enhanced with this proposed system.

However the problem with recorded audio video information is that when the user desires to search for a particular recorded scene there are no search keys other than the time. Thus it is not easy to search for a scene as a list of scenes cannot be provided. For example even when the meeting has been video recorded the user needs to search for a part recorded scene that he desires to view in the recorded data without any search keys. This may require an enormously long time depending on the recorded time considering the number of frames included in a single set of video data.

Patent document 1 discloses an invention for solving the above problem with a device having the following technical feature. That is multimedia information is managed based on time information indicating the association between plural media storage information elements in terms of time. This makes it possible to search for a first media storage information element which is relatively easy to find and then reproduce a second media storage information element corresponding to the time information of the first media storage information element thereby enhancing searching efficiency.

Patent document 2 discloses an invention for solving the above problem with a system having the following technical feature. This system includes a device for recording scenes of a lecture presentation or a meeting as contents data of video audio information. The system also includes a device with which a user can input specify important scenes which the user needs to review later on as key information during the course of recording the scenes. Pattern information is obtained by encoding the key information a time stamp indicating a position in the contents data URL Uniform Resource Locator . The pattern information is printed on a paper medium. The pattern information printed on the paper medium is read with an input device such as a barcode scanner or a digital camera. In this manner it is possible to access the contents data recorded when the key information was input.

However with the conventional technology described in patent document 1 the user is required to find the data in which the meeting is recorded before using the time information to search for a part of the video which the user desires to view. That is the user is required to search on his own the recorded data that includes the scene which he desires to view. Accordingly the user needs to specify search conditions e.g. the date of recording the name of the meeting attendants an agenda keyword in order to search for the recorded data that he desires to view which is time consuming for the user. Furthermore the more data items recorded the more time will be required to search for the desired data item.

As for the conventional technology described in patent document 2 unless the user is using the dedicated tool or application on a daily basis it is difficult to utilize the recorded data. Furthermore in order to transmit the recorded information to a third party or to share the recorded information with a third party it is necessary to deliver the dedicated tool application to the corresponding third party.

Under practical circumstances users organize and share information by creating documents on a daily basis with the use of applications and systems such as a text editor a word processor a blog system and a CMS Contents Management System and storing such documents in a storage device such as a local PC or an HDD Hard Disk Drive in a server. Under such practical circumstances multimedia contents which are recorded to be efficiently utilized later on are stored separately from document data that are viewed edited by the user on a daily basis. Thus the recorded multimedia data are not efficiently utilized by users.

In this example a protocol for delivering real time audio video information via a network such as the Internet or an intranet is referred to as the rtsp Real Time Streaming Protocol .

On the other hand in the case of using on demand delivery the video data of a meeting that have already been recorded are delivered as a stream from the Web video server management server which is the on demand publishing point to the client PC information processing device .

As shown in directly under the folder specified as an on demand publishing point video data items recorder02 0001.wmv and recorder01 1234.wmv shown in of all of the meetings recorded by the recording PC are collectively stored.

The on demand publishing point is set beforehand in the Web video server management server including the video delivery program . The folder used as the on demand publishing point for storing the video data to be delivered on demand can be created in the HDD of the Web video server management server .

As a result in the client PC information processing device the following URL is input to an address space of a reproduction page for video data displayed when the video reproduction program is executed. This makes it possible to view the video data stored in the on demand publishing point.

 Example of Specifying a URL of a Video Which the User Desires to Reproduce from a Reproduction Page for the Video Data 

In the client PC information processing device according to the present embodiment the following program is installed and stored in the HDD of the client PC information processing device .

Next with reference to a description is given on how multimedia contents e.g. video data obtained by recording a currently held meeting and presentation materials used in the meeting such as still image data and text data managed by the Web video server management server are generated in the contents management system according to the present embodiment.

The multimedia contents managed by the Web video server management server are generated by the recording program of the recording PC .

The recording program uses the video encoder of the recording PC to record data obtained by compressing in a Windows Media Video WMV format the video signals and audio signals input to the recording PC from the camera or the microphone and to record page signals sent from the page displaying PC as still images.

When the recording program according to the present embodiment is executed by the recording PC a page as shown in is displayed.

As shown in the display page recording page includes a video display region for displaying video signals acquired from the camera a page display region for displaying page signals sent from the page displaying PC and recording operation control buttons which function as a UI User Interface for controlling recording operations including Start Stop buttons to start stop recording a meeting and a force termination button the x button in the top right corner of for ending the recording program

The statuses the status as to whether each UI function is valid invalid during recording of the three buttons shown in are indicated in .

When recording is not performed stopped the Start button and the force termination button the x button in are valid as the recording operation control buttons which can be used for giving instructions to start recording or to end the recording program . At this time the Stop button is invalid as the recording operation control button and thus will not function even when pressed by a pointing device such as a mouse.

Furthermore when recording is being performed the Stop button is valid as the recording operation control button which can be used for giving an instruction to stop recording. At this time the Start button and the force termination button the x button in are invalid as the recording operation control buttons and thus will not function even when pressed by a pointing device such as a mouse.

The recording program determines whether the force termination button the x button in of the recording operation control buttons has been pressed with a pointing device such as a mouse step S .

When the force termination button the x button in has been pressed Yes in step S the recording program closes the display page recording page and ends the program.

When the force termination button the x button in has not yet been pressed No in step S the recording program determines whether the Start button of the recording operation control buttons has been pressed step S .

When the Start button has been pressed Yes in step S the recording program starts recording in accordance with an instruction to start recording and performs the recording start process described below step S .

The recording program calls an openrec servlet of the Web server program included in the Web video server management server thereby reporting to the Web server program that recording has started. As a result the recording program acquires a newly issued recording ID in response to a process result from the openrec servlet. For example when the recording PC has a host name of recorder01 a request message of GET openrec host recorder01 HTTP 1.1 is sent to the Web server program to report that recording has been started by the recording PC having the host name of recorder01 . In this example the recording ID that is returned from the openrec servlet to the recording program is 1234 .

The recording program instructs the video encoder used in the program to start sending pushing compressed video data video data in WMV format to the video delivery program of the Web video server management server . The recording program determines the name of a broadcast publishing point to be created in the video delivery program according to a rule of name of itself recording ID e.g. 1234 . That is the broadcast publishing point will have a name of recorder01 1234 .

As a result the video delivery program starts writing the video data that have been sent pushed in the on demand publishing point which is a predetermined storage region in the HDD of the Web video server management server . This file is also named according to the same rule as that of the broadcast publishing point. That is the file name will be recorder01 1234.wmv .

The recording program continuously performs compression processes on the video signals and on the audio signals with the video encoder and sends pushes the compressed video data video data in WMV format to the video delivery program of the Web video server management server .

The recording program compresses the page signals sent from the page displaying PC in a JPEG Joint Photographic Experts Group format every five seconds for example and records the compressed signals as still image data. Every time still image data are recorded an uploadscreen servlet of the Web server program included in the Web video server management server is called in a POST format. Accordingly the still image data are uploaded to the Web video server management server . For example when there is an image displayed on the screen of the page displaying PC that is in synchronization with a time point corresponding to ten minutes after the meeting having the recording ID of 1234 has started 600 seconds later recid 1234 sec 600 is specified as a parameter of an uploadscreen servlet. The screen image at this point still image data in JPEG format is uploaded in the multipart form data format.

The recording program extracts a frame from video signals input from the camera every five seconds for example. The recording program compresses the extracted frame in a JPEG format and records the compressed frame as still image data. Every time the still image data are recorded an uploadvideoframe servlet of the Web server program included in the Web video server management server is called in a POST format. Accordingly the still image data are uploaded to the Web video server management server . For example when a video image signal is extracted ten minutes 600 seconds after starting to record a meeting having the recording ID of 1234 recid 1234 sec 600 is specified as the parameter of the uploadvideoframe servlet and the frame image still image data in JPEG format at that time is uploaded in a multipart form data format.

Next the recording program determines whether the Stop button of the recording operation control buttons has been pressed with a pointing device such as a mouse step S .

When the Stop button has not yet been pressed No in step S the process control returns to step S data recording process .

When the Stop button has been pressed Yes in step S the recording program stops recording in accordance with an instruction to stop recording and performs the recording end process described below step S .

The recording program stops the process of compressing the video signals and audio signals continuously performed by the video encoder and the process of sending pushing the compressed video data video data in WMV format to the video delivery program of the Web video server management server . Furthermore the recording program deletes the broadcast publishing point in the present embodiment which is recorder01 1234 created at the time of starting the recording.

The recording program stops the process of compressing recording in a JPEG format the page signals sent from the page displaying PC .

The recording program calls the closerec servlet of the Web server program included in the Web video server management server thereby reporting to the Web server program that recording has ended. For example if the recording PC has a host name of recorder01 and the recording ID for identifying the meeting being recorded is 1234 a request message of GET closerec host recorder01 recid 1234 HTTP 1.1 is sent to the Web server program thereby reporting that the recording PC having the host name of recorder01 has finished recording the meeting indicated by the recording ID of 1234 .

Each of the servlets is called from the recording program with the use of an API Application Programming Interface called WinInet Wininet.dll that is pre installed before shipment in Microsoft Internet Explorer registered trademark 3.0 and onward.

Accordingly in the contents management system according to the present embodiment the recording PC converts the video signals and the audio signals input from the camera and the microphone into multimedia contents of an appropriate data format so that the multimedia contents can be stored in a predetermined storage region a folder at the on demand publishing point in the HDD of the Web video server management server . As a result the stored multimedia contents can be managed.

The contents managing function of the contents management system according to the present embodiment is mainly realized by a contents storing function of the Web video server management server a data recording function of the recording PC and a link information generating function of the client PC information processing device .

In the following a description is given of the configuration of the link information generating function of the client PC information processing device according to an embodiment of the present invention with reference to .

In the client PC information processing device according to the present embodiment the generating unit acquires the storage destination of the video data that are the target of the reproduction request i.e. information regarding the destination to which the video data are supplied when a reproduction request is made.

Next in the client PC information processing device the generating unit attaches to the information regarding the storage destination of the acquired video data the name of the servlet to perform a reproduction process among the group of servlets of the Web server program included in the Web video server management server the recording ID acquired by the display unit and the reproduction starting point information of the video data acquired by the acquiring unit . Accordingly link information is generated which is used for making a reproduction request to the play servlet that performs the reproduction process of the Web server program

In the client PC information processing device according to the present embodiment the storing unit stores in a predetermined storage region clipboard of the SDRAM the link information generated by the generating unit and content information indicating the content of the video data for which the user desires to make a reproduction request video data accessed from link information as the clipboard data CF HTML data in the HTML format.

The client PC information processing device according to the present embodiment sets via the UI page as shown in the content information indicating the content of the video data for which a reproduction request is given to a servlet that performs the reproduction process of the Web server program included in the Web video server management server . The client PC information processing device temporarily stores the clipboard data in which the set content information of the contents is associated with the link information for making the reproduction request in a predetermined storage region clipboard in the SDRAM . Accordingly the link information for making a request to reproduce the video data can be easily pasted onto document data that are being edited with a document creating application which a user uses on a daily basis. Thus the document data and the multimedia contents can be conveniently associated with each other.

By performing the above described procedures 1 through 3 of the link information generating function of the client PC information processing device the contents management system according to the present embodiment realizes the function of efficiently using multimedia contents from document data that are viewed edited by the user on a daily basis .

The above described processing procedures of the link information generating function of the client PC information processing device are described with reference to .

The client PC information processing device according to the present embodiment loads in a memory which is the SDRAM the link information generating program for performing the process of the link information generating function stored in the HDD and executes it with the CPU . At this time the following processing procedures of steps S through S are executed.

The client PC information processing device according to the present embodiment acquires information regarding a presently being recorded meeting from the Web video server management server step S .

In the client PC information processing device according to a command from the application control unit the Web client calls the getcurrec servlet of the Web server program included in the Web video server management server to acquire information regarding a currently being recorded meeting.

At this time in the client PC information processing device the application control unit reads a value of a key e.g. sWebServerPath of the setting file shown in stored in the HDD via the file I F . Accordingly the application control unit acquires a host name e.g. videoserver.abc.com of the Web server program from which the getcurrec servlet is to be called and passes the acquired host name to the Web client .

In the client PC information processing device based on the host message passed from the application control unit the Web client sends a request message such as GET getcurrec HTTP 1.1 to the Web server program included in the Web video server management server .

As a result when a meeting indicated by the recording ID 1234 recorded by the recording PC recorder01 is ongoing since Mar. 27 2006 10 00 00 the getcurrec servlet returns a character string such as host recorder01 recid 1234 start 2006 03 27T10 00 00 as the response to the request to the Web client which is the calling source.

The client PC information processing device determines whether there is a currently being recorded meeting based on the information of the response from the getcurrec servlet of the Web server program included in the Web video server management server step S .

In a case where the above meeting information is received as a response from the getcurrec servlet Yes in step S the Web client receives information of a currently being recorded meeting. Then according to a command from the application control unit the display unit displays the UI page for selecting a currently being recorded meeting as shown in on a display device e.g. CRT LCD step S .

In a case where null characters are received as a response from the getcurrec servlet No in step S according to a command from the application control unit the display unit displays the display page for reporting that there are no meetings currently being recorded as shown in on a display device e.g. CRT LCD step S .

The client PC information processing device determines with the user operations input unit whether the OK button or the end button which are the selection operation control buttons of the UI page shown in has been pressed by a pointing device such as a mouse step S .

When the user operations input unit detects that the end button has been pressed end button in step S the detection result is passed from the user operations input unit to the application control unit and the application control unit ends the link information generating process.

When the user operations input unit detects that the OK button has been pressed OK button in step S the detection result is passed from the user operations input unit to the application control unit and the application control unit temporarily stores in the SDRAM the recording ID and the starting time and date of the meeting selected by the user.

In the client PC information processing device according to a command from the application control unit the display unit displays the UI page including the reproduction starting point information setting region and the content information setting region as shown in on a display device e.g. CRT LCD step S .

The client PC information processing device determines with the user operations input unit whether the force termination button of the UI page shown in x button shown in has been pressed by a pointing device such as a mouse step S .

When the user operations input unit detects that the force termination button x button shown in has been pressed Yes in step S the detection result is passed from the user operations input unit to the application control unit and the application control unit ends the information generating process.

When the user operations input unit has not yet detected that the force termination button x button shown in has been pressed No in step S the user operations input unit receives via the selection setting space of the content information setting region for selecting setting content information content information for indicating the content of the video data of the meeting selected by the user which content information is selected set with the use of a pointing device such as a mouse and a keyboard. The user operations input unit passes the received content information of the contents to the application control unit and the application control unit temporarily stores the content information in the SDRAM .

Next the client PC information processing device determines with the user operations input unit whether the reproduction starting point setting button of the UI page shown in Copy button shown in has been pressed by a pointing device such as a mouse step S .

When the user operations input unit has not yet detected that the reproduction starting point setting button Copy button shown in has been pressed No in step S the process control returns to step S and the user operations input unit waits until it detects that the reproduction starting point setting button Copy button shown in has been pressed. Thus during this time it is possible to select set change via the UI page the information indicating the content of the video data of the meeting selected by the user.

When the client PC information processing device detects with the user operations input unit that the reproduction starting point setting button Copy button shown in has been pressed Yes in step S according to a command from the application control unit that has received the detection result from the user operations input unit the Web client calls a getelapsedtime servlet of the Web server program included in the Web video server management server . Accordingly the Web client acquires the elapsed time from when recording has started for the meeting selected by the user which meeting corresponds to the recording ID that has been temporarily stored in the SDRAM in step S.

The client PC information processing device sends with the Web client a request message such as GET getelapsedtime recid 1234 HTTP 1.1 to the Web server program included in the Web video server management server based on the recording ID temporarily stored in the SDRAM .

As a result for example when the time and date of calling the getelapsedtime servlet is Mar. 27 2006 10 10 00 the getelapsedtime servlet returns a character string such as sec 600 as a response to the request to the Web client which is the calling source.

At this time the client PC information processing device determines whether the meeting selected by the user is currently being recorded based on the information of the response from the getelapsedtime servlet of the Web server program included in the Web video server management server step S .

When the above elapsed time information is received as a response from the getelapsedtime servlet Yes in step S the Web client receives the elapsed time information and the link generating unit performs the following procedure according to a command from the application control unit . That is the link generating unit attaches the following information to the information regarding the storage destination read in step S e.g. http videoserver.abc.com of the recorded video data of the meeting. Specifically the name of the servlet e.g. play for performing a reproduction process among the group of servlets in the Web server program the recording ID acquired in step S and elapsed time information which is the reproduction starting point information of the video data acquired in step S are attached. Then the link generating unit generates link information for making a reproduction request to the servlet for performing the reproduction process of the Web server program included in the Web video server management server and passes the generated link information to the application control unit step S .

In the client PC information processing device the application control unit generates the clipboard data in a HTML clipboard format CF HTML . Specifically the clipboard data associates the link information received from the link generating unit with content information of the contents such as text data or image data set via the selection setting space and or the setting space of the content information setting region in the UI page shown in . Then the application control unit stores the clipboard data in a predetermined storage region clipboard of the SDRAM step S . The process control returns to step S and the processing procedures of the link information generating process from step S onward are repeated.

When null characters are returned from the getelapsedtime servlet No in step S according to a command from the application control unit the display unit displays a display page for reporting that the meeting has ended as shown in on a display device e.g. CRT LCD step S .

In the client PC information processing device when the user confirms the contents displayed in the display page shown in and presses an OK button of the display page with a pointing device such as a mouse the process control returns to step S and the processing procedures of the link information generating process from step S onward are repeated.

In this manner by performing the processing procedures of steps S through S shown in the client PC information processing device according to the present embodiment generates link information for accessing multimedia contents such as audio video data managed as recording data. This link information is generated based on reproduction starting point information indicating the reproduction starting point of the multimedia contents specified by the user e.g. the elapsed time and the number of frames from when recording started . When performing an operation of pasting the generated link information onto document data edited with a document creating application used by the user on a daily basis the link information is first stored in a predetermined region clipboard of a memory for temporarily storing information to be pasted onto document data.

With reference to a description is given of operations performed with the link information generating function of the client PC information processing device according to the present embodiment. Specifically the operation of pasting link information stored in a predetermined storage region clipboard of the SDRAM onto document data being edited with a document creating application used by the user on a daily basis and the operation of displaying the display page reproduction page for reproducing video data from the pasted link information are described.

The client PC information processing device according to the present embodiment includes a document creating application provided with a document editing function to copy cut paste information such as a text editor a word processor or e mail which is used by the user on a daily basis.

In such an application when the user is editing the document data and the link information generating program according to the present embodiment is started up the link information of the multimedia contents which the user desires to reproduce later is stored in a predetermined recording region clipboard of the SDRAM . While the document data are being edited the paste function of edit is selected from a menu of the document creating application or the Ctrl V keys are pressed on the keyboard. Accordingly the link information can be easily pasted onto the document data as shown in .

The elapsed time information in the third row and the screen image in the fourth row of are obtained by pasting the clipboard data shown in onto the document data .

Next with reference to a description is given of processing procedures of the link information generating function of the client PC information processing device according to the present embodiment when reproducing video data of a meeting that has been held in the past .

For example the client PC information processing device according to the present embodiment loads in a memory which is the SDRAM the link information generating program for performing the process of the link information generating function stored in the HDD and executes the link information generating program with the CPU . At this time the following processing procedures of steps S through S are executed.

The client PC information processing device according to the present embodiment acquires from the Web video server management server information pertaining to video data of a presently being reproduced meeting step S .

In the client PC information processing device according to a command from the application control unit the Web page I F identifies the Internet Explorer registered trademark currently being activated in the client PC information processing device with the use of an API of Microsoft based on a window name called IEFrame . Then from the specified Internet Explorer registered trademark the Web page I F finds the display page in which the video data of the meeting are reproduced based on a URL specified in the address space. Accordingly the Web page I F acquires information pertaining to video data of the currently being reproduced meeting. The event sink of Internet Explorer registered trademark and the control values and setting values of the HTML elements are acquired at this stage with the use of DCOM.

The client PC information processing device determines whether there are any currently being reproduced video data based on the information pertaining to the currently being reproduced video data of the meeting acquired by the above method step S .

When information pertaining to the currently being reproduced video data of the meeting has been acquired Yes in step S the Web page I F receives the information of the currently being reproduced video data and according to a command from the application control unit the display unit displays on a display device e.g. CRT LCD a UI page for selecting currently being reproduced video data of a meeting that has been held in the past as shown in step S .

As shown in the UI page displays as information pertaining to the currently being reproduced video data a video data information display region for displaying the recording ID and the starting time and date for identifying video data of a meeting that has been recorded and selection operation control buttons which function as a UI for controlling selection operations including an OK button for entering a selection of a meeting and an end button for ending the selection operation ending the UI page .

When information pertaining to currently being reproduced video data of a meeting has not been acquired No in step S according to a command from the application control unit the display unit displays on a display device e.g. CRT LCD a display page as shown in reporting that there are no meeting data currently being reproduced step S .

As shown in the display page displays a message that there are no meeting data currently being reproduced and an end button for ending the display page . After the user confirms the displayed message the user presses the end button with a pointing device such as a mouse and ends the display page .

The client PC information processing device determines with the user operations input unit whether the OK button or the end button which are the selection operation control buttons of the UI page shown in has been pressed by a pointing device such as a mouse step S .

When the user operations input unit detects that the OK button has been pressed OK button in step S the detection result is passed from the user operations input unit to the application control unit and according to a command from the application control unit the Web page I F starts the event sink and control operations of the reproduction page for reproducing the video data of the meeting selected by the user.

Next in the client PC information processing device according to a command from the application control unit the display unit displays on a display device e.g. CRT LCD the UI page having the reproduction starting point information setting region and the content information setting region as shown in step S .

The client PC information processing device determines with the user operations input unit whether the force termination button the x button in in the UI page shown in has been pressed with a pointing device such as a mouse step S .

When the user operations input unit detects that the force termination button the x button in has been pressed Yes in step S the user operations input unit passes the detection result to the application control unit and the application control unit ends the link information generating process.

When the user operations input unit has not yet detected that the force termination button the x button in has been pressed No in step S the user operations input unit receives via the selection setting space of the content information setting region for selecting setting content information content information for indicating the content of the video data of the meeting selected by the user which content information is selected set with the use of a pointing device such as a mouse and a keyboard. The received content information of the contents is passed to the application control unit and the application control unit temporarily stores the content information in the SDRAM .

Next the client PC information processing device determines with the user operations input unit whether the reproduction starting point setting button Copy button shown in of the UI page shown in has been pressed by a pointing device such as a mouse step S .

When the user operations input unit has not yet detected that the reproduction starting point setting button Copy button shown in has been pressed No in step S the process control returns to step S and the user operations input unit waits until it detects that the reproduction starting point setting button Copy button shown in has been pressed. Thus during this time it is possible to select set change via the UI page the information indicating the content of the video data of the meeting selected by the user.

When the client PC information processing device detects with the user operations input unit that the reproduction starting point setting button Copy button shown in has been pressed Yes in step S the Web page I F performs the following. That is according to a command from the application control unit that has received the detection result from the user operations input unit the Web page I F acquires from the display page reproducing the video data for which the event sink and the control operation are executed the elapsed time from when recording started for the meeting of the recording ID selected by the user.

The client PC information processing device acquires with the Web page I F the currently being reproduced position of the video reproduction program operating in the video data reproduction page by using DCOM.

The client PC information processing device determines whether the video data of the meeting selected by the user is still being reproduced based on the elapsed time information acquired by the Web page I F step S .

When the Web page I F has acquired the elapsed time information by the above method Yes in step S according to a command from the application control unit the link generating unit attaches the following information to the information e.g. http videoserver.abc.com pertaining to the storage destination of video data of a currently reproduced meeting read in step S. Specifically the name of the servlet e.g. play for performing a reproduction process among a group of servlets of the Web server program the recording ID acquired in step S and the elapsed time information which is reproduction starting point information of the video data acquired in step S are attached. Furthermore the link generating unit generates link information for making a reproduction request to the servlet for performing the reproduction process of the Web server program and passes the generated link information to the application control unit step S .

In the client PC information processing device in accordance with a HTML clipboard format CF HTML the application control unit generates the clipboard data . Specifically in the clipboard data the link information received from the link generating unit is associated with content information indicating the content of the contents which content information corresponds to text data or image data set with the selection setting space and the setting space of the content information setting region of the UI page shown in . Then the application control unit stores the clipboard data in a predetermined storage region clipboard of the SDRAM step S . The process control returns to step S and the processing procedures of the link information generating process from step S onward are repeated.

When the Web page I F has not acquired the elapsed time information by the above method No in step S according to a command from the application control unit the display unit displays a display page reporting failed to acquire elapsed time information as shown in on a display device e.g. CRT LCD step S .

In the client PC information processing device after the user confirms the displayed contents of the display page shown in and the user presses an OK button of the display page with a pointing device such as a mouse the process control returns to step S and the processing procedures of the link information generating process from step S onward are repeated.

In this manner by performing the processing procedures of steps S through S shown in the client PC information processing device according to the present embodiment realizes the process in which link information for accessing multimedia contents such as audio video data managed as recorded data is generated based on reproduction starting point information e.g. the elapsed time and the number of frames from when recording started indicating the reproduction starting point of the multimedia contents specified by the user and when pasting the generated link information onto document data being edited with a document creating application used by the user on a daily basis the link information is stored in a predetermined region clipboard in a memory used for temporarily storing information to be pasted onto the document data .

As described above according to the first embodiment of the present invention the contents management system realizes the link information generating function by the following processing procedures.

The client PC information processing device according to the present embodiment acquires with the acquiring unit the reproduction starting point information of the video data selected with the selecting unit which the user desires to reproduce by making a reproduction request to the servlet for performing a reproduction process of the Web server program included in the Web video server management server which request is made with the use of link information. This information is acquired at a timing when the reproduction starting point setting button Copy button shown in in the reproduction starting point information setting region of the UI page shown in is pressed by a pointing device such as a mouse.

The client PC information processing device according to the present embodiment acquires with the generating unit the storage destination of the video data which are the target of the reproduction request i.e. the destination to which the video data are to be supplied when the reproduction request is made.

Next in the client PC information processing device according to the present embodiment the generating unit attaches the following information to the acquired information pertaining to the storage destination of the video data. Specifically the name of the servlet to perform a reproduction process among the group of servlets of the Web server program included in the Web video server management server the recording ID acquired by the display unit and the reproduction starting point information of the video data acquired by the acquiring unit are attached. Accordingly link information is generated which is for making a reproduction request to the servlet for performing the reproduction process of the Web server program

In the client PC information processing device according to the present embodiment the storing unit stores in a predetermined storage region clipboard of the SDRAM the link information generated by the generating unit and content information indicating the content of the video data for which the user desires to make a reproduction request video data accessed from link information as the clipboard data CF HTML data in the HTML format.

The client PC information processing device according to the present embodiment sets via the UI page as shown in the content information indicating the content of the video data for which a reproduction request is given to a play servlet of the Web server program included in the Web video server management server . The client PC information processing device temporarily stores the clipboard data in which the set content information of the contents is associated with the link information for making the reproduction request in a predetermined storage region clipboard in the SDRAM . Accordingly the link information for making a request to reproduce the video data can be easily pasted onto document data that are being edited with a document creating application that a user uses on a daily basis. Thus the document data and the multimedia contents can be conveniently associated with each other.

By performing the above described procedures 1 through 3 the contents management system according to the present embodiment can achieve the following. That is link information for accessing the multimedia contents such as audio video data managed as recorded data is generated based on reproduction starting point information e.g. the elapsed time and the number of frames from when recording started indicating the reproduction starting point of multimedia contents specified by a user. When pasting the generated link information onto the document data being edited the link information is stored in a predetermined region clipboard in a memory used for temporarily storing information to be pasted onto the document data . Accordingly the link information of the multimedia contents including the reproduction starting point information can be easily pasted onto the document data being edited and the user s document data can be conveniently associated with the multimedia contents managed by the Web video server management server .

Thus the contents management system according to the present embodiment makes it possible to efficiently utilize multimedia contents from the document data such as sharing the multimedia contents with a third party via the document data that are viewed edited by a user on a daily basis.

In the present embodiment the link information generating function of the client PC information processing device of the contents management system includes an interface for adjusting the reproduction starting point of video data of a meeting selected by a user. Therefore link information of multimedia contents which information includes reproduction starting point information for reproducing the video from an appropriate scene which the user desires can be easily pasted onto document data that are being edited. Accordingly multimedia contents can be efficiently utilized from document data that are viewed edited by a user on a daily basis.

The difference between the second embodiment and the first embodiment is that in the second embodiment the link information generating function includes an interface for adjusting the reproduction starting point for setting the reproduction starting point of video data of a meeting selected by the user.

Thus in the following description of the present embodiment elements corresponding to those of the first embodiment are denoted by the same reference numbers and are not further described. Only the elements that are different from those of the first embodiment are described with reference to .

Next with reference to a description is given of a unit for realizing link information generating function included in the client PC information processing device according to the present embodiment described with reference to .

To realize the link information generating function according to the present embodiment the client PC information processing device includes the display unit the selecting unit the setting unit the acquiring unit the generating unit the storing unit and a changing unit as shown in .

In the following a description is given of the display unit and the changing unit which are different from the first embodiment.

The display unit displays a page with a GUI function which is used by a user facing the client PC information processing device for using the link information generating function .

When the link information generating function is used in the client PC information processing device according to the present embodiment the display unit displays the UI page for selecting video data of a meeting as shown in on a display device e.g. CRT LCD via the display I F .

The user selects with a pointing device such as a mouse the video data of a meeting for which the user desires to generate link information with the generating unit from the UI page displayed on a display device e.g. CRT LCD .

When the user selects video data the display unit displays the UI page as shown in on a display device e.g. CRT LCD after receiving the video data via the display I F .

As shown in the UI page includes a reproduction starting point information setting region for setting information of a reproduction starting point of video data which the user desires to reproduce by making a reproduction request to the play servlet which request is made with the use of link information video data to be accessed from link information and a reproduction information setting region for setting information to be reproduced when the changing unit adjusts and sets the reproduction starting point as described below.

In the reproduction starting point information setting region the reproduction starting point setting button Copy button shown in for setting a reproduction starting point of video data for making a reproduction request to the play servlet and a reproduction information display region for displaying reproduction information set via the reproduction information setting region are displayed.

Furthermore the reproduction information setting region displays a selection setting space as reproduction information to be reproduced when adjusting and setting the reproduction starting point. Specifically the selection setting space is for selecting setting either one of a frame image in the video data of the meeting an item for selecting setting a video frame in or a screen image displayed on a screen by the page displaying PC during a meeting being held an item for selecting setting a screen in .

The user selects and sets reproduction information frame image or screen image to be reproduced when adjusting and setting the reproduction starting point with the changing unit described below from the selection setting space for reproduction information in the UI page displayed on a display device e.g. CRT LCD by selecting a radio button of the corresponding selection setting item with a pointing device such as a mouse.

When the user selects sets the reproduction information and subsequently presses the reproduction starting point setting button Copy button shown in while viewing the display page of the Web browser the display unit displays the UI page as shown in on a display device e.g. CRT LCD via the display I F .

As shown in the UI page primarily displays a reproduction starting point information changing region for changing the information of the reproduction starting point of video data which the user desires to reproduce by making a reproduction request to the play servlet which request is made with the use of link information video data to be accessed from link information and a content information setting region for setting content information for clearly and directly indicating the content of the video data.

The reproduction starting point information changing region includes the reproduction information display region for displaying the reproduction information that has been selected set with the selection setting space for reproduction information shown in and a reproduction starting point adjusting interface slider control for adjusting the reproduction starting point that has been temporarily set as the user pressed the reproduction starting point setting button shown in Copy button shown in .

In the content information setting region the selection setting space and the setting space are displayed. The selection setting space is for selecting setting content information which clearly and directly indicates a scene in the video data reproduced by accessing link information. The setting space is for appropriately setting the horizontal and vertical size pixels of an image when an image is used as the content information.

In this manner the display unit displays a page functioning as a UI on a display device e.g. CRT LCD connected to the client PC information processing device via the display I F . Therefore the display unit is included in the display unit shown in .

Next a description is given of a unit for adjusting the reproduction starting point via the UI page described with reference to .

The changing unit changes within a predetermined range the reproduction starting point information indicating a reproduction starting point of video data of a meeting selected by a user.

The changing unit uses as a reference the reproduction starting point temporarily set when the user pressed the reproduction starting point setting button Copy button shown in of the UI page shown in . Based on this reference the changing unit adjusts the reproduction starting point with the reproduction starting point adjusting interface slider control of the UI page shown in .

For example the user is viewing on the display page of the Web browser a recorded meeting selected with the selecting unit . When the user comes across a scene which the user desires to reproduce later the user instructs the acquiring unit to acquire the reproduction starting point by pressing the reproduction starting point setting button Copy button shown in of the UI page with a pointing device such as a mouse.

In accordance with the instruction from the user to acquire the reproduction starting point the acquiring unit acquires the reproduction starting point information from the Web video server management server .

The acquiring unit acquires the reproduction starting point information by the following method. The acquiring unit calls the getelapsedtime servlet of the Web server program included in the Web video server management server and based on the information obtained from the response the acquiring unit acquires reproduction starting point information such as the elapsed time sec from when recording of the meeting started.

As a result the following character string indicating the elapsed time sec from when the recording started for the meeting identified with the recording ID is sent from the Web video server management server .

The reproduction starting point information acquired as above is temporarily stored in the SDRAM of the client PC information processing device .

The changing unit described below with reference to uses as a reference the reproduction starting time information e.g. elapsed time information acquired by the acquiring unit to adjust the reproduction starting point with the reproduction starting point adjusting interface slider control .

Adjustment of the reproduction starting point performed by the changing unit is described below with reference to .

The user selects a tab of the reproduction starting point adjusting interface slider control as shown in with a pointing device such as a mouse and slides it sideways while selecting it to change the reproduction starting point that has been temporarily set. The maximum movement amount and the minimum movement amount of sliding this tab is within a certain range as shown in . This range is set beforehand at the stage of implementing the reproduction starting point adjusting interface slider control in consideration of the extent which is adjustable by sliding the tab

Furthermore in the reproduction information display region of the UI page shown in a frame image or a screen image which is selected set as reproduction information is displayed. Based on information such as an attached time stamp the displayed frame image or screen image changes in synchronization with the movement of the reproduction starting point adjusting interface slider control .

The changing unit detects the movement direction movement amount of the tab of the reproduction starting point adjusting interface slider control within a certain amount of time t e.g. 0.5 seconds . Then based on reproduction starting point information reference value which has been temporarily set by the acquiring unit the changing unit calculates the amount of change change amount from the reference value by performing an addition process with the following formula.

 Formula Used when Reproduction Starting Point Information is the Elapsed Time from when Recording Started formula 1 

When the reproduction starting point setting button Copy button shown in included in the UI page is pressed the changing unit sets the initial value of the change amount T from the reference value at 0 seconds.

When the tab of the reproduction starting point adjusting interface slider control slides the changing unit repeatedly performs the following processes A through C for every updating period t sec .

 A The changing unit detects a position coordinates of the tab in a coordinate space of the display page .

 B The changing unit obtains a multiple s of the time change amount corresponding to the detected position coordinates . For example when the position of the tab slides by two scale marks toward the negative side as viewed in the changing unit performs a calculation to obtain 4 seconds as the multiple s of the time change amount with respect to the updating period t sec .

 C The changing unit assigns these values in formula 1 to calculate the change amount T 0 4 0.5 from the reference value thereby obtaining 2 seconds.

Furthermore for example in a case where the tab of the reproduction starting point adjusting interface slider control slides from a position of two scale marks toward the negative side as viewed in to a position of four scale marks toward the positive side as viewed in the changing unit sets the initial value of the change amount T from the reference value at 2 seconds.

 A The changing unit detects a position coordinates of the tab in a coordinate space of the display page .

 B The changing unit obtains a multiple s of the time change amount corresponding to the detected position coordinates . For example when the position of the tab slides by four scale marks toward the positive side as viewed in the changing unit performs a calculation to obtain 4 seconds as the multiple s of the time change amount with respect to the updating period t sec .

 C The changing unit assigns these values in formula 1 to calculate the change amount T 2 4 0.5 from the reference value thereby obtaining 0 seconds.

As described above the changing unit uses a predetermined formula such as formula 1 to calculate the change amount from a reference value when the tab of the reproduction starting point adjusting interface slider control slides.

Next the changing unit adds the change amount from the reference value calculated with the use of formula 1 to the reproduction starting point information which is the reference value to change the reproduction starting point information to the final value.

For example when the tab of the reproduction starting point adjusting interface slider control slides by two scale marks toward the negative side as viewed in the change amount T 2 seconds from the reference value calculated with formula 1 is added to the elapsed time information 600 seconds which is the reproduction starting point information acquired by the acquiring unit thereby changing the reproduction starting point information to the final value i.e. 598 seconds.

In this case the changing unit can use formula 1 to calculate the reproduction starting point information of the reference value as a number of frames. For example assuming that the tab of the reproduction starting point adjusting interface slider control moves by a certain number of screen images n the reproduction starting point information of the reference value can be calculated by the same method as formula 1. As a result with the use of the reproduction starting point adjusting interface slider control the reproduction starting point information can be adjusted to the time of acquiring the T th image from the reference screen image which reference screen image has been set when the reproduction starting point setting button Copy button shown in was pressed.

While the tab of the reproduction starting point adjusting interface slider control is released from a pointing device such as a mouse the changing unit detects the movement amount of the tab and changes the reproduction starting point information by the above described calculation method.

Furthermore the changing unit temporarily stores in the SDRAM of the client PC information processing device the changed reproduction starting point information when the changing unit has detected that the tab has popped up upon being released.

In this manner the changing unit updates the reproduction starting point information based on the movement amount of the tab of the reproduction starting point adjusting interface slider control which movement amount is detected via the input I F . Therefore the changing unit is included in the user operations input unit shown in .

As described above in the client PC information processing device the changing unit changes the reproduction staring point information the generating unit generates new link information with the use of the changed reproduction starting point information and the storing unit stores the generated link information in a predetermined storage region clipboard in the SDRAM .

As a result in a predetermined storage region clipboard in the SDRAM of the client PC information processing device according to the present embodiment the clipboard data in the HTML format as shown in are stored.

The contents management system according to the present embodiment executes the above described units of the client PC information processing device according to the following procedures.

In the client PC information processing device according to the present embodiment the acquiring unit acquires reproduction starting point information of video data selected with the selecting unit which the user desires to reproduce by making a reproduction request to the servlet that performs a reproduction process of the of the Web server program included in the Web video server management server which request is made with the use of link information. Specifically the acquiring unit acquires this information at a timing when a pointing device such as a mouse presses the reproduction starting point setting button Copy button shown in of the reproduction starting point information setting region of the UI page shown in .

 Procedure 2 Change Reproduction Starting Point Information Adjustment of Reproduction Starting Point 

In the client PC information processing device according to the present embodiment the changing unit detects the movement amount of the tab of the reproduction starting point adjusting interface slider control in the UI page shown in . Based on the detected movement amount and the reproduction starting point information reference value temporarily set by the acquiring unit the changing unit calculates the change amount from the reference value with a predetermined formula.

Next the client PC information processing device adds the change amount calculated by the changing unit to the reference value and changes the reproduction starting point information.

In the client PC information processing device according to the present embodiment the generating unit acquires the storage destination of the video data that are the target of the reproduction request i.e. information regarding the destination to which the video data are supplied when a reproduction request is made.

Next in the client PC information processing device the generating unit attaches to the information regarding the storage destination of the acquired video data the name of the servlet to perform a reproduction process among the group of servlets of the Web server program included in the Web video server management server the recording ID acquired by the display unit and the reproduction starting point information of the video data changed by the changing unit . Accordingly link information is generated which is used for making a reproduction request to the servlet that performs the reproduction process of the Web server program

In the client PC information processing device according to the present embodiment the storing unit stores in a predetermined storage region clipboard of the SDRAM the link information generated by the generating unit and content information indicating the content of the video data for which the user desires to make a reproduction request video data accessed from link information as the clipboard data CF HTML data in the HTML format.

The client PC information processing device according to the present embodiment sets via the UI page as shown in the content information indicating the content of the video data for which a reproduction request is given to a play servlet of the Web server program included in the Web video server management server . The client PC information processing device temporarily stores in a predetermined storage region clipboard in the SDRAM the clipboard data in which the set content information of the contents is associated with the link information for making the reproduction request. Accordingly the link information for making a request to reproduce the video data can be easily pasted onto document data that are being edited with a document creating application which a user uses on a daily basis. Thus the document data and the multimedia contents can be conveniently associated with each other.

By performing the above described procedures 1 through 4 of the link information generating function of the client PC information processing device the contents management system according to the present embodiment realizes the function of easily pasting onto document data being edited the link information for multimedia contents which information includes reproduction starting point information for reproducing the video data from an appropriate scene which the user desires and efficiently using multimedia contents from document data that are viewed edited by the user on a daily basis .

Next with reference to a description is given of processing procedures of the link information generating function of the client PC information processing device according to the present embodiment.

In the client PC information processing device according to the present embodiment for example the link information generating program for performing a process of the link information generating function stored in the HDD is loaded in a memory which is the SDRAM and executed by the CPU . At this stage the following processing procedures steps S through S are executed.

The client PC information processing device according to the present embodiment acquires information pertaining to a currently being recorded meeting from the Web video server management server step S .

In the client PC information processing device according to a command from the application control unit the Web client acquires information pertaining to a currently recorded meeting by calling the getcurrrec servlet of the Web server program included in the Web video server management server .

In the client PC information processing device the application control unit reads via the file I F the value of a key e.g. sWebServerPath of the setting file shown in stored in the HDD thereby acquiring the host name e.g. videoserver.abc.com of the Web server program from which the getcurrec servlet is to be called. The application control unit passes the acquired host name to the Web client .

In the client PC information processing device the Web client sends to the Web server program of the Web video server management server a request message such as GET getcurrec HTTP 1.1 based on the received host name.

As a result for example when a meeting indicated by the recording ID corresponding to 1234 which is currently being recorded by the recording PC corresponding to recorder01 is being held since Mar. 27 2006 10 00 00 the getcurrec servlet sends a character string such as host recorder01 recid 1234 start 2006 03 27T10 00 00 in response to a request from the Web client which is the calling source.

Based on the information obtained from the response of the getcurrec servlet of the Web server program included in the Web video server management server the client PC information processing device determines whether there is a currently being recorded meeting step S .

In a case where the above meeting information is received as a response from the getcurrec servlet Yes in step S the Web client receives information of a currently being recorded meeting. Then according to a command from the application control unit the display unit displays the UI page for selecting a currently being recorded meeting as shown in on a display device e.g. CRT LCD .

In a case where null characters are received as a response from the getcurrec servlet No in step S according to a command from the application control unit the display unit displays the display page for reporting that there are no meetings currently being recorded as shown in on a display device e.g. CRT LCD step S .

The client PC information processing device determines with the user operations input unit whether the OK button or the end button which are the selection operation control buttons of the UI page shown in has been pressed by a pointing device such as a mouse step S .

When the user operations input unit detects that the end button has been pressed end button in step S the detection result is passed from the user operations input unit to the application control unit and the application control unit ends the link information generating process.

When the user operations input unit detects that the OK button has been pressed OK button in step S the detection result is passed from the user operations input unit to the application control unit and the application control unit temporarily stores in the SDRAM the recording ID and the starting time and date of the meeting selected by the user.

In the client PC information processing device according to a command from the application control unit the display unit displays the UI page including the reproduction starting point information setting region and the content information setting region as shown in on a display device e.g. CRT LCD step S .

The client PC information processing device determines with the user operations input unit whether the force termination button of the UI page shown in x button shown in has been pressed by a pointing device such as a mouse step S .

When the user operations input unit detects that the force termination button x button shown in has been pressed Yes in step S the detection result is passed from the user operations input unit to the application control unit and the application control unit ends the information generating process.

When the user operations input unit has not yet detected that the force termination button x button shown in has been pressed No in step S the user operations input unit receives via the selection setting space for selecting setting information indicating the contents of the content information setting region information indicating the content of the video data of the meeting selected by the user which has been selected set with the use of a pointing device such as a mouse and a keyboard. The user operations input unit passes the received content information of the contents to the application control unit and the application control unit temporarily stores the content information in the SDRAM .

Next the client PC information processing device determines with the user operations input unit whether the reproduction starting point setting button of the UI page shown in Copy button shown in has been pressed by a pointing device such as a mouse step S .

When the user operations input unit has not yet detected that the reproduction starting point setting button Copy button shown in has been pressed No in step S the process control returns to step S and the user operations input unit waits until it detects that the reproduction starting point setting button Copy button shown in has been pressed. Thus during this time it is possible to select set change via the UI page the information indicating the content of the video data of the meeting selected by the user.

When the client PC information processing device detects with the user operations input unit that the reproduction starting point setting button Copy button shown in has been pressed Yes in step S according to a command from the application control unit that has received the detection result from the user operations input unit the Web client calls a getelapsedtime servlet of the Web server program included in the Web video server management server . Accordingly the Web client acquires the elapsed time from the starting time of recording the meeting selected by the user corresponding to the recording ID that has been temporarily stored in the SDRAM in step S.

The client PC information processing device sends with the Web client a request message such as GET getelapsedtime recid 1234 HTTP 1.1 to the Web server program included in the Web video server management server based on the recording ID temporarily stored in the SDRAM .

As a result for example when the time and date of calling the getelapsedtime servlet is Mar. 27 2006 10 10 00 the getelapsedtime servlet returns a character string such as sec 600 as a response to the request to the Web client which is the calling source.

At this time the client PC information processing device determines whether the meeting selected by the user is currently being recorded based on the information of the response from the getelapsedtime servlet of the Web server program included in the Web video server management server step S .
