title: Process and system for distributing particles for incorporation within a composite structure
abstract: A system and process is disclosed for binding particles to a carrier material in an isolated relationship for use in composite fabrication. A slurry comprising particles dispersed in fluid is created in particle suspension tanks, deposited as a uniform layer and filtered using reduced pressure applied to a filter belt to leave behind isolated particles, the reduced pressure further acting to overcome electrostatic and other forces of attraction between the particles until they can be permanently bound to the carrier with a binder or adhesive and collected on a take-up roll.

It is sometimes desirable to incorporate particles of various kinds into composite structures such that they are isolated from one another. As an example hard particles are often incorporated into soft matrix composites in a dispersed relationship to provide strength to the composite. If such particles are allowed to conglomerate the resulting composite will be less tolerant of stress fracturing under tension. However creating a dispersed relationship of particles in composites can prove difficult when such particles have properties that cause them to attract each other and stick together. For example some aerospace composite structures require the incorporation of electrically conducting high aspect ratio particles such as carbon fibers to be fixed in a spaced relationship so that the particles are electrically isolated from one another. Unfortunately the electrostatic interaction between these particles causes them to stick together before they can be secured in a dispersed electrically isolated relationship within the composite structure to be formed. This problem is particularly present in the dry application of particles to carrier materials supplied in web format for example fabric discontinuous fiber mat or veil which are to be handled in aerospace composite fabrication processes such as autoclave compression and resin transfer molding.

A system and process are disclosed for dispersing particles and stabilizing them in an isolated relationship until they can be bound to a carrier material and retained in that relationship for use in composite fabrication processes.

Described herein is a system and process for dispersing particles and stabilizing them in a spaced isolated relationship until they can be secured to a carrier material in that relationship for easy handling and incorporation into composite structures. To accommodate the typical web format of carrier materials used in composite fabrication processes a continuous method is further disclosed. For polymer ceramic or metal matrix composite applications requiring the incorporation of particles in an evenly spaced dispersed or isolated relationship the dry handling and application of particles can present difficulties as such particles often have the tendency to stick together via electrostatic interactions or other forces of attraction or adhesion. This is particularly true in the manufacture of aircraft composites requiring the incorporation of electrically conductive high aspect ratio carbon fibers in an electrically isolated arrangement and also may apply to the incorporation of particles into composites for the purposes of strengthening such composites. Utilizing the system and process disclosed herein problems of electrostatic interactions and other forces causing particles to conglomerate can successfully be overcome thereby facilitating the manufacture of composite structures comprising evenly dispersed isolated particles. The system and process of the present disclosure further provides an increased level of efficiency for the manufacture of composite structures through the disclosure of a continuous process that yields a rolled carrier material with stably bound isolated particles for easy handling and incorporation into a variety of applications.

As shown in feed roll supplies carrier to first surface A of movable filter belt . Second surface B of filter belt runs over and flush with troughs and . Proceeding generally downstream of feed roll are particle suspension tanks and which deposit particle slurry onto carrier drying station for providing energy in the form of heated air for drying binder application station for providing binder energy station for providing energy release film feed roll for feeding release film consolidation roller and finally take up roll .

The particles of the present disclosure may comprise for example single filament electrically conductive high aspect ratio carbon fibers approximately long and 10 microns in diameter or may comprise any other type of particle small enough to have a tendency of sticking together via electrostatic forces or other forces of attraction. Carrier may comprise fabric veil or mat for example or other carrier materials commonly used for the fabrication of polymer matrix composites and should be fluid permeable. If electrically conductive high aspect ratio carbon fibers are applied to carrier then carrier should be of non conductive or insulative properties such that the fibers may remain electrically insulated from one another when bound in an isolated relationship on carrier .

Carrier is provided by feed roll and ultimately collected in take up roll . Take up roll may be mechanized to advance carrier from feed roll . Carrier is fed onto a first surface A of the movable filter belt the filter belt being of fluid permeable construction. Carrier and filter belt should be controlled to advance at the same rate with carrier lying flush with the filter belt first surface A. Particle suspension tanks and are filled with particles and a fluid the fluid preferably comprising water. Each particle suspension tank and is capable of dispersing the particles via agitation for example by ultrasonic energy or mechanical stirring to create particle slurry . Furthermore each particle suspension tank and is rotatable and geometrically designed such that if rotated at a constant speed a constant flow rate of particle slurry is uniformly poured out onto carrier . By adjusting the rate of rotation of the particle suspension tanks and along with the feed rate of carrier from feed roll the rate of distribution of particle slurry onto carrier can be controlled. To ensure the continual depositing of a layer of particle slurry onto carrier each particle suspension tank and may operate synchronously such that while one tank is being emptied and poured onto carrier the other is being charged with more particle slurry described in more detail with reference to . Further it can be appreciated that any number of particle suspension tanks and may be used as needed.

A vacuum or gas flow applied to troughs and creates a reduced pressure on a second surface B of filter belt to draw the fluid from the deposited particle slurry through fluid permeable carrier and the filter belt . Vacuum filter belts with troughs having a reduced pressure are commercially available and may be purchased from Larox Corporation. As the fluid is drawn from the deposited particle slurry through carrier and filter belt carrier will function like filter belt as a filter that keeps the dispersed particles from passing through carrier thereby leaving behind isolated particles on the carrier surface or embedded in that surface. The particles will be isolated due to the dispersed nature of the particles in particle slurry . Carrier must be tightly woven enough or possess pores small enough so as to prevent the significant pass through of the dispersed particles yet nonetheless allow for fluid permeability. Similarly filter belt must have pores of a size to prevent a significant quantity of particles from passing through the belt or lodging into the pores while allowing for fluid permeability.

The reduced pressure in the troughs and further creates a positive down draft air flow that functions to not only dry residual fluid remaining in carrier and attached to particles but to also stabilize particles in their isolated relationship to the carrier until particles can be permanently bound to the carrier in that relationship by application of binder at binder application station . Optionally if the down draft air flow is not sufficient to dry particles particularly if a water intolerant binder is to be used a drying station may be used to provide energy such as heated air down through carrier filter belt and into trough . In such case particles will then continue to be held in place by the positive down draft heated air flow provided by drying station until reaching the binder application station . Additionally a reduced pressure may be applied to trough to assist in stabilizing particles on carrier surface. It may be appreciated that any number of troughs can be used the amount of reduced pressure or vacuum applied to each trough being independently controllable as needed to stabilize particular particles being handled in an isolated relationship.

At binder application station a vacuum applied to trough will continue to stabilize particles in their isolated position until binder is applied to particles and carrier to permanently stabilize particles in their position on carrier . Binder can be a liquid binder liquid slurry or 100 solid binder and preferably comprises a soluble polymer that is compatible with the final composite to be formed. In case of liquid type binders binder may be sprayed or curtain walled onto particles and carrier . Otherwise techniques such as vibration dispersion may be used to apply solid heat fusible binder powders onto particles and carrier . In addition to stabilizing particles in their isolated relationship until application of binder the positive down draft air flow created by the negative pressure in trough flowing past particles and through carrier may further function to evaporate any solvent or fluid in binder for controlled disposal and may assist in setting binder depending on the type of binder used. Subsequently if necessary for the particular binder used an energy station can provide energy for melting fusing drying or putting a degree of cure into binder to bring the binder particle carrier combination into a more stable state for rolling and subsequent handling. The degree of cure imparted to binder will depend on for example whether making the final composite structure requires binder to mix with resin injected into the polymer composite matrix for later curing of the composite structure to be formed. Energy can include thermal heat hot air radiant heat from electrical sources or electromagnetic energy for example and may either be directly applied to carrier and binder or indirectly via a fluid such as air or nitrogen. If a hard binder is used energy may be provided for the purpose of softening binder to make it compatible with the later formation and curing of the final composite structure.

Once particles are stably bound to carrier in their isolated relationship carrier with bound particles may then be collected on take up roll for convenient handling in the fabrication of polymer composite structures including aerospace composite fabrication processes such as autoclave compression and resin transfer molding. To prevent carrier coated with bound isolated particles from adhering to itself on take up roll release film from release film feed roll may be applied to carrier via consolidation roller . Consolidation roller may be chilled to cool the binder particle carrier combination if still hot from application of energy . Chilling can be performed using methods such as circulated chilled oil chilled water or refrigerant for example.

Proceeding generally downstream of feed roll are particle suspension tanks and which deposit particle slurry onto carrier drying station for providing energy in the form of heated air for drying binder release film feed roll for supplying binder release film coated with binder binder shown in and binder applied via heated consolidation roller and chilled roller for cooling down the temperature of binder release film and binder . Optional equipment for the addition of a second release film include release film feed roll for feeding release film pressure roller for applying pressure to the release film and finally take up roll .

Carrier is provided by feed roll onto first surface A of movable filter belt . Particle suspension tanks and are filled with particles and are operated to create particle slurry via agitation. Particle slurry is deposited onto carrier using the method described with reference to . A vacuum or gas flow applied to troughs and creates a reduced pressure on second surface B of filter belt to draw the fluid from the deposited slurry through fluid permeable carrier and filter belt leaving behind isolated particles on carrier surface or embedded in that surface.

The reduced pressure applied to troughs and furthermore creates a positive down draft air flow that functions to dry residual fluid remaining in carrier and attached to particles and to stabilize particles in their isolated relationship to carrier until they can be permanently bound to carrier in that relationship by application of binder . If necessary drying station may be used to provide energy such as heated air down through carrier filter belt and into trough to provide additional drying prior to application of binder . Additionally a reduced pressure may be applied to trough to assist in stabilizing particles on carrier surface. It may be appreciated that any number of troughs can be used the amount of reduced pressure or vacuum applied to each trough independently controllable as needed to stabilize the particular particles being handled in an isolated relationship.

Binder coated on release film fed from binder release film feed roll is applied to carrier and particles using heated consolidation roller . Roller may be heated using methods such as circulated heated oil heated water or electric heat. It may be appreciated that a hot melt adhesive may alternatively be applied in a similar manner.

Particle suspension tanks and are filled with particles and are operated to create a particle slurry via agitation. Particle suspension tanks and operate synchronously as described with reference to except that in system and process B of particle slurry is deposited directly onto first surface A of filter belt . Filter belt is fluid permeable but possesses pores small enough to prevent the significant pass through of any particles into troughs and . A vacuum or gas flow applied to troughs and creates a reduced pressure on second surface B of filter belt to draw the fluid from deposited slurry through filter belt .

The reduced pressure as it draws fluid from the particle slurry through filter belt leaves behind isolated particles on filter belt first surface A or embedded in that surface. The reduced pressure furthermore creates a positive down draft air flow that functions to dry residual fluid remaining on filter belt and attached to particles and to stabilize particles in their isolated relationship to filter belt until they can be permanently bound to adhesive film . If necessary drying station may be used to provide energy such as heated air down through filter belt and into trough to provide additional drying prior to application of adhesive film . Additionally a reduced pressure may be applied to trough to assist in stabilizing particles on filter belt first surface A.

Adhesive film coated on release film is brought into contact with first surface A of filter belt by heated consolidation roller . Particles stabilized in an isolated relationship on first surface A via negative pressure applied to trough will then be bound to and stabilized in an isolated relationship on adhesive film .

Adhesive film coated on release film with bound particles may then be collected in take up roll for convenient handling in the fabrication of polymer composite structures including aerospace composite fabrication processes such as autoclave compression and resin transfer molding. Furthermore if needed release film may be supplied by release film feed roll and applied by pressure roller to prevent adhesive film with bound isolated particles from adhering to release film in take up roll .
