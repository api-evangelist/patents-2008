This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 041 425 filed Apr. 1 2008 the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

The arrival of Internet has ushered in an era in which computer security is of great importance. Because computers can now easily communicate computer users can now unwittingly download and install software applications that when executed as software processes maliciously steal or destroy sensitive information or otherwise cause computers to behave in unexpected and undesirable ways. For instance a software application embedded in an innocuous email attachment may when clicked on by a user of a computer launch a software process that sends credit card information stored on the computer to another computer. Accordingly various computer security techniques have been developed to control the ability of software processes executing on a computer to perform actions with regard to other resources provided by the computer.

In one such technique each sensitive resource provided by a computer is associated with an access control list. The access control list associated with a resource specifies users who are allowed to perform actions with regard to the resource. For instance an access control list associated with a file that contains a credit card number may specify that processes associated with a user named Harry are allowed to read the file and may specify that processes associated a user named Tom are not allowed to read the file.

In another such technique a computer stores capability lists associated with each user of the computer. The capability list associated with a user lists which sensitive resources the user is allowed to access. For instance a capability list associated with a user named Robert may specify that processes initiated by Robert are allowed to communicate on the Internet and that processes initiated by Robert are allowed to read a file that contains a credit card number.

This disclosure describes techniques of using a centralized rule database to control the abilities of software processes to perform actions with regard to resources provided by a computer. As described herein each software process executing in a computer executes within a chamber and each resource provided by the computer is associated with a canonical name that uniquely identifies the resource. Furthermore the computer stores a set of security rules in a centralized rule database. In addition this disclosure describes techniques of enforcing the rules stored in the centralized rule database.

The techniques of this disclosure may be conceptualized in a variety of ways. For example the techniques of this disclosure may be conceptualized as a method that comprises storing a set of rules in a centralized rule database each rule specifying a set of actions that a subject account has a right to perform with regard to protected resources having canonical names described by a resource name pattern. In addition the method comprises associating each software process of a device with a chamber in a plurality of chambers wherein none of the software processes are associated with more than one of the chambers. Each chamber in the plurality of chambers is associated with at least one of the software processes. The method also comprises providing a set of service providers that performs an action with regard to one of the protected resources in response to a request from one of the software processes when the centralized rule database includes a rule that grants to an account associated with the chamber associated with the software process a right to perform the action with regard to the one of the protected resources. For each of the software processes the software process uses the service providers to perform actions on any of the protected resources that are not associated with the software process. Furthermore the method comprises receiving with a target service provider that is one of the service providers a request from a requesting software process that is one of the software processes. The method also comprises performing with the target service provider in response to the request an action with regard to a target resource when the centralized rule database includes a rule that grants to a subject account a right to perform the action with regard to the target resource wherein the target resource is one of the protected resources wherein the subject account is an account associated with the chamber associated with the requesting software process.

In another example the techniques of this disclosure may be conceptualized as a device that comprises a plurality of protected resources each of which is associated with a distinct canonical name. The device also comprises a centralized rule database that stores a set of rules each rule specifying a set of actions that a subject account has a right to perform with regard to ones of the protected resources having canonical names described by a resource name pattern. In addition the device comprises a set of software processes that includes each software process of the device. Each of the software processes is associated with a chamber in the plurality of chambers and each of the chambers is associated with at least one of the software processes. Furthermore the device comprises a security infrastructure that for any of the software processes associated with any of the chambers prevents the software process from directly or indirectly performing an action on any of the protected resources that are outside the chamber except when one of the rules in the centralized rule database grants to a subject account a right to perform the action on a target resource. The target resource is one of the protected resources that is not associated with the chamber. The subject account is an account associated with the chamber.

In another example the techniques of this disclosure may be conceptualized as a computer readable medium comprising instructions that when executed by a computer cause the computer to extract a set of rules from a document that contains extensible markup language XML elements one or more of which represents one of the rules. Each of the rules includes 1 a resource name attribute that specifies a resource name pattern that describes Internationalized Resource Identifiers IRIs that identify protected resources of the device 2 a speaker attribute that specifies an account identifier that identifies an account associated with a process that created the rule and 3 a priority attribute that specifies a priority of the rule. A first subset of the rules also include an authorize property that includes one or more delegation match attributes wherein each match attribute of a rule in the first subset of the rules includes 1 a delegate account identifier attribute that specifies an account identifier and 2 a delegation action attribute that specifies a set of actions. A second subset of the rules also includes a delegation property that includes one or more match attributes wherein each match attribute of a rule in the first subset of the rules includes 1 an account identifier attribute that specifies an account identifier and 2 an action attribute that specifies a set of actions. The instructions also cause the device to store the set of rules in a centralized database. In addition the instructions cause the device to generate for each software process of the device an access token that specifies a chamber in a plurality of chambers wherein none of the software processes are associated with more than one of the chambers wherein each chamber in the plurality of chambers is associated with at least one of the software processes. The instructions also cause the device to provide a set of service providers that only perform an action with regard to one of the protected resources in response to a request from one of the software processes when the centralized rule database includes a rule that grants to an account associated with the chamber associated with the software process a right to perform the action with regard to the one of the protected resources. For each of the software processes the software process must use the service providers to perform actions on any of the protected resources that are not associated with the software process. In addition the instructions cause the device to launch a client process. The instructions also cause the device to invoke with the requesting process a method of a software interface implemented by a target server provider that is one of the service providers. Furthermore the instructions cause the device to invoke with the method of the target service provider after the method of the target service provider is invoked a rule check method implemented by a rule enforcement engine that is part of a trusted computing base of the device specifying a canonical resource name of a target resource that is one of the protected resources as a resource name parameter of the rule check method specifying the access token for the requesting process as a subject parameter of the rule check method and specifying a set of at least one right as a rights requested parameter of the rule check method. In addition the instructions cause the device to invoke with the rule check method after the rule check method is invoked a query method implemented by a database service provider that is part of the trusted computing base of the device specifying a trusted computing base account as a speaker parameter of the query method specifying the resource name specified by the resource name parameter of the rule check method as a resource name parameter of the query method and specifying the access token specified by the subject parameter of the rule check method as a subject parameter of the query method. The instructions also cause the device to initialize with the query method when the query method is invoked a priority variable to indicate a lowest priority a rights granted variable to an empty set of rights a stop processing flag to false. Furthermore the instructions cause the device to identify with the query method after the priority variable is initialized a matching rule set that includes all rules in the centralized database that include a speaker attribute that specifies the trusted computing base account and that include a resource name attribute that specifies a resource name pattern that describes the resource name specified by the resource name parameter of the query method. The instructions also cause the device to 1 identify with the query method after identifying the matching rule set a current rule set that includes all rules in the matching rule set that include a priority attribute that specifies a priority equal to a priority specified by the priority variable. In addition for each of the rules in the current rule set the instructions cause the device to 2 

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Device may be a wide variety of different types of devices. For instance device may be a handheld computing device such as a mobile telephone a tablet computer a smart phone a personal digital assistant a personal media player a portable gaming system or another type of handheld computing device. In another instance device may be a personal computer a laptop computer a computer kiosk a server an intermediate network device a network appliance a server blade a telephone a television set top box a game console an electronic gambling device a mainframe computer a specialized scientific computer or another type of computing device. In a third instance device may be a device integrated into a vehicle including manned and autonomous civilian and military vehicles trucks trains watercraft aircraft spacecraft and other types of vehicles .

As illustrated in the example of device includes a chipset that facilitates data communication between a processor a graphics chipset an Input Output I O controller a network interface and a data storage medium . Chipset may be many different types of chipsets. For instance chipset may be a chipset in the Advanced Micro Devices chipset series manufactured by Advanced Micro Devices of Sunnyvale Calif. a chipset in the nForce chipset series by Nvidia Corporation of Santa Clara Calif. or another type of chipset. Chipset may exchange information with processor graphics chipset I O controller networking interface and data storage medium using a variety of different types of buses and or interconnects. For instance chipset may use a PCI Express interconnect to exchange data with graphics chipset and may use a Low Pin Count LPC bus to exchange data with I O controller .

It should be appreciated that device may include many other components in addition to processor graphics chipset I O controller network interface and data storage medium . For instance device includes a power distribution system that is not illustrated in the example of . Furthermore it should be appreciated that in other instances devices implementing the techniques of this disclosure may not include all of the components illustrated in the example of . For instance a device that implements the techniques of this invention might not include a network interface a graphics chipset and or an I O controller.

Data storage medium represents a logical collection of one or more volatile and or non volatile data storage media that are capable of storing data including software instructions and application data. For instance data storage medium may represent one or more magnetic disks optical discs flash memory units dynamic random access memory RAM units RamBus RAM units synchronous dynamic RAM units or other types of data storage media.

Processor is an integrated circuit that is capable of executing instructions. For example processor may be a microprocessor an application specific integrated circuit a digital signal processor a graphics processing unit or another type of integrated circuit that is capable of executing instructions. For instance processor may be a Core processor manufactured by Intel Corporation of Santa Clara Calif. or a K10 processor manufactured by Advanced Micro Devices Inc. of Sunnyvale Calif. Although not illustrated in the example of device may include several such processors. Processor may read data stored in data storage medium by retrieving the data via chipset . Moreover processor may write data to data storage medium by sending the data to data storage medium via chipset .

Network interface enables device to send data on a network and to receive data from the network. For instance network interface may be an Ethernet network interface a token ring network interface a fiber optic network interface a WiFi network interface a WiMax network interface or another type of wired or wireless network interface. When network interface receives data from the network network interface may store the data in data storage medium by sending the data to data storage medium via chipset . Furthermore processor may send data via chipset to network interface for transmission on the network.

Graphics chipset may be one or more integrated circuits that render graphics for output on a display device. For instance graphics chipset may perform 2 dimensional and 3 dimensional graphics operations in response to requests from processor .

I O controller enables device to receive input from peripheral input devices such as keyboards mice trackballs touch sensitive screens microphones and other peripheral input devices. In addition I O controller may enable input from and output to devices attached to device via Universal Serial Bus USB ports serial buses parallel buses and other types of devices.

As illustrated in the example of data storage medium stores software applications A N collectively software applications . Software applications may be a wide variety of different types of software applications. For instance software applications may be word processing applications spreadsheet applications multimedia applications game applications network browser applications computer virus applications spyware applications or other types of legitimate or malicious software applications. When executed by processor software applications become one or more software processes. In other words when processor executes instructions in any of software applications the instructions may cause processor to manage one or more software processes. 

As illustrated in the example of data storage medium stores an operating system . For example operating system may be a Microsoft VISTA operating system a Microsoft Windows XP operating system a Microsoft Windows CE operating system a Windows Server operating system a Linux operating system an Apple Macintosh operating system or another type of operating system. When executed by processor operating system manages the sharing of the resources of device . For example operating system controls and allocates random access memory manages a file system sends and receives data via a network manages creation and termination of software processes manages prioritization of software processes manages software process context switching manages thread context switch manages virtual memory manages inter process communication manages a registry and so on. Furthermore operating system provides software interfaces that enable software processes to access resources of device . For example operating system may provide a software interface that enables software processes to read data from and write data to files in the file system a software interface that enables software processes to create other software processes a software interface that enables software processes to receive data from and send data to a network and so on.

When device starts up device automatically begins executing operating system . After launching but before operating system allows any user mode processes to begin executing operating system may require a user of device to log in. For example operating system may require user to provide a username and password and may log in user when user provides a password that corresponds to the entered username. After user logs in operating system may automatically launch one or more of software applications . In addition after user logs in user may instruct operating system to launch one or more of software applications .

As described in detail below when operating system launches one of software applications operating system may create an access token associated the resulting software process. The access token of the software process identifies a chamber within which the software process executes. As used in this disclosure a chamber is a virtual execution environment. A chamber is a virtual execution environment in the sense that a software process executing in the chamber can interact with resources within the chamber but cannot interact with resources in other chambers except when granted the right to do so. For example a first software process operating in a first chamber cannot interact with a second software process operating in a second chamber but the first software process and the second software process can interact with a common set of lower level resources. In some circumstances a software process operating in a first chamber can use a lower level resource to communicate with a software process operating in a second chamber.

Each chamber is associated with an account or a group of accounts recognized by device . Each account is associated with a unique name. In other words in the example shown no two accounts recognized by device can have the same name.

Device may recognize several different types of accounts. For example device may recognize accounts associated with individual people accounts associated with supervisors and an account associated with a Trusted Computing Base TCB . An account associated with an individual person may have limited rights to perform actions on resources. A supervisor account is an account that has greater rights than a user account. The TCB account is a special account that has unlimited rights to all resources of device . Processes in the TCB of device are only permitted to operate in a chamber associated with the TCB account.

As described in detail below each resource of device is associated with a canonical name. In the example shown no two resources of device can have the same canonical name. In one implementation the canonical names of resources are Internationalized Resource Identifiers IRIs as defined in Internet Engineering Task Force IETF Request For Comment RFC 3987. An IRI is a sequence of characters from the Universal Character Set Unicode ISO 10646 that identifies a resource. For example the canonical name of a file in a file system may be Management file Documents and Settings Smith My Documents bookreport.doc . In another example the canonical name of a fax service may be Management Windows System32 Fax . Slash characters i.e. divide canonical names of resources into path segments. For instance in the previous example Window System32 and Fax are each path segments.

A centralized rule database maintained by operating system stores rules each of which specifies one or more actions that a software process associated with an account or group of accounts is permitted to perform on one or more resources. For instance each rule stored in centralized rule database includes an account portion an action portion and a resource name pattern portion. In this instance the account portion of a rule is a string that identifies an account or group of accounts. The action portion of a rule is a string that describes a particular type of action. These actions may include read write execute and or other types of actions. The resource name pattern portion of a rule is a string that describes a set of canonical names of resources. For example Management Windows System32 Fax is a resource name pattern that describes the canonical name of a single resource.

Resource name patterns may include wildcard characters. In one example implementation resource name patterns may include wildcard characters and or wildcard characters. In this implementation the wildcard character represents one or more path segments and is only valid as the last path segment of a resource name pattern. For example Management Windows System32 is a resource name pattern that describes all canonical names that begin with the string Management Windows System32 . In this example Management Windows System32 Fax and Management Windows System32 TCP are canonical names of resources that begin with the string Management Windows System32 . Furthermore in this implementation the wildcard character represents any one path segment and may be used in place of any path segment in a resource name pattern. For example Management dms ext is a resource name pattern that describes all canonical names that begin with the string Management dms specify any single path segment and end with the string ext . In this example Management dms ABC ext and Management dms XYZ ext are canonical names of hypothetical resources described by the resource name pattern Management dms ext .

When a software process executing in a chamber associated with a specific account wants to perform an action that requires the use of a particular resource the software process may invoke a method of a software interface provided by operating system . For example when the software process wants to read information from a particular file the software process may invoke a hypothetical read String filename method provided by operating system . When the software process invokes the method operating system automatically determines whether the invoked method is permitted to perform the requested action on behalf of the software process. Operating system may determine whether the invoked method is permitted to perform the action on behalf of the software process by determining whether a rule in centralized rule database grants to the account the right to perform the requested action with regard to the protected resource. If centralized rule database contains such a rule operating system may permit the invoked method to perform the requested action on behalf of the software process. Otherwise if centralized rule database does not contain such a rule operating system does not permit the invoked method to perform the requested action on behalf of the software process.

When the software process invokes the method operating system uses rules in centralized rule database to determine whether the account has a right to perform the action on the protected resource . In the previous example operating system uses the rules in centralized rule database to determine whether the account has a right to write to the particular file.

If the account has a right to perform the action on the protected resource YES of operating system permits the invoked method to perform the action on the protected resource . In the previous example when the account has a right to perform the action on the protected resource operating system permits the writeToFile method to write the data to the particular file.

On the other hand if the account does not have a right to perform the action on the protected resource NO of operating system does not permit the invoked method to perform the action on the protected resource . In the previous example when the account does not have a right to perform the action on the protected resource operating system does not permit the writeToFile method to write the data to the particular file.

As illustrated in the example of device includes operating system and operating system includes a security infrastructure . Security infrastructure prevents any process operating in a chamber from directly or indirectly performing an action on any protected resources that are outside the chamber except when one of the rules in the centralized rule database explicitly grants to the account associated with the chamber a right to perform the action on one of the protected resources that is outside the chamber. Security infrastructure may be part of a trusted computing base of device . The trusted computing base of device is the software in device that is considered vital to the security of device .

Furthermore in the example of security infrastructure includes a set of one or more account documents . Account documents are files that define accounts. As used in this disclosure an account is a logical group of one or more users. Each account is associated with an account identifier that is usable in rules. For example one of account documents may include the following Extensible Markup Language XML element that defines an account 

Furthermore in the example of security infrastructure includes a set of rule documents . Rule documents are files that contain rules. In one implementation rule documents may contain XML elements that represent the rules.

In one example implementation each rule has a resource name pattern attribute a priority attribute and speaker attribute. The resource name pattern attribute of a rule specifies a resource name pattern that describes a set of canonical names of resources.

The priority of a rule specifies the priority category of the rule. Because the resource name pattern attributes of rules may specify resource name patterns that describe the canonical names of multiple resources multiple rules may be applicable to a single resource. These rules may potentially contradict each other. For instance a first rule may indicate that a particular account only has a right to read a particular resource and a second rule may indicate that the particular account only has a right to execute the particular resource. The priority categories specified by priority attributes of rules may help to resolve such conflicts by indicating which rule to apply when more than one rule is applicable.

The speaker attribute of a rule specifies an account identifier of a speaker of the rule. As used in this disclosure an account that created a rule is the speaker of the rule. Rules may be created by a variety of different accounts. As a result a rule created by a user associated with a low level account could contradict a rule created by a user associated with a high level account. For example a senior information technology IT officer at a company may create rules in rule documents and a junior IT officer may also create rules in rule documents . Consequently the junior IT officer may inadvertently create a rule that contradicts a rule created by the senior IT officer. To prevent this result each rule includes a speaker attribute that specifies an account identifier associated with a user who created the rule. As described below when conflicting rules are evaluated preference may be given to a rule that was created by a user with higher priority.

Furthermore rules in centralized rule database may include one or more authorize properties. Each authorize property of a rule includes one or more match properties. A match property of an authorize property indicates actions that accounts are authorized to i.e. have a right to perform with regard to resources having canonical names described by the resource name pattern specified by the resource name pattern attribute of the rule.

In one implementation each match property has an account identifier attribute an action attribute and a stop attribute. The account identifier attribute of a match property specifies an account identifier that identifies an account or group of accounts. For example the account identifier attribute of a match property may specify the account identifier Supervisor Group . The action attribute of a match property specifies one or more actions. For instance the action attribute of a match property may specify the actions READ and WRITE . The stop attribute of a match property specifies true or false. When the stop attribute of the match property specifies true then no lower priority rule is permitted to grant a right to the account identified by the account identifier attribute of the match property to perform an action on a resource having a canonical name described by the resource name pattern specified by the resource name pattern attribute of the rule. On the other hand if the stop attribute of the match property specifies false then a lower priority rule is permitted to grant a right to the account identified by the account identifier attribute of the match property to perform an action on a resource having a canonical name described by the resource name pattern specified by the resource name pattern attribute of the rule.

In this way each match property of an authorize property of a rule indicates that a process in a chamber associated with an account identified by the account identifier attribute of the authorize property has a right to perform the action specified by the action attribute of the authorize property on resources having canonical names described by a resource name pattern specified by the resource name pattern attribute of the rule.

In an implementation in which rules are represented as XML elements one of rule documents may include the following rule element 

Rule documents may include rules that include delegation properties. In general terms a delegation property specifies that a specific account is allowed to create rules that govern the ability of processes in chambers associated with other accounts to perform actions on the resources covered by the rule. In one implementation a delegation property of a rule indicates an account. Users associated with this account have the right to make rules that authorize other accounts to perform actions with regard to resources having canonical names described by the resource name pattern specified by the resource name pattern attribute of the rule. For example a rule having a speaker attribute that specifies a trusted computing base TCB account may include a delegation property that indicates that a supervisor account is permitted to make rules that authorize other accounts to perform actions with regard to files in a particular directory of a file system.

In one implementation delegation properties are formatted in rule documents as XML properties of rule elements. For instance one of rule documents may include the following XML rule element 

Rules that include delegation properties may form chains of delegation rules. For example a chain of delegation rules may include a first rule that indicates that a first account delegates a right to make rules regarding an action performed on certain resources to a second account. In this example the chain of delegation rules may include a second rule that indicates that the second account delegates a right to make rules regarding the action performed one or more of the certain resource to a third account and so on.

It should be appreciated that the rules may include other types of properties. For example a rule may include a call DLL property that specifies that a particular dynamic link library DLL must be invoke to determine whether an account has a right to perform an action with regard to a particular resource.

As illustrated in the example of security infrastructure includes a rule loader . When security infrastructure is initialized rule loader reads account documents and loads the accounts stored in account documents into an account database . In implementations in which the accounts are represented in account documents as XML elements the accounts may be accessed more quickly when the accounts are stored in account database than when the accounts are represented as XML elements in account documents . In addition rule loader reads rule documents and loads the rules stored in rule documents into centralized rule database . In implementations in which the rules are represented in rule documents as XML elements the rules may be accessed more quickly when the rules are stored in centralized rule database than when the rules are represented as XML elements in rule documents .

Account database and centralized rule database may be a variety of different types of databases. For instance account database and or centralized rule database may be relational databases associative databases files file systems Online Analytic Processing OLAP data cubes object oriented databases hash tables or other data storage structures. It should be appreciated that in some implementations account database and or centralized rule database may be regarded or implemented as a single database or as multiple databases.

Furthermore as illustrated in the example of security infrastructure includes a rule database provider . Rule database provider implements a software interface that includes one or more methods for querying centralized rule database and account database . For example rule database provider may implement an access right query method that accepts a speaker parameter a resource name parameter and a subject parameter. In this example the speaker parameter specifies an account identifier of a first account the resource name parameter specifies a canonical name of a resource and the subject parameter specifies an account identifier that identifies a second account. Furthermore in this example the access right query method returns a value that indicates rights to perform actions with regard to the resource that are granted to the second account by rules created by the first account. An example operation of rule database provider to identify rights to perform actions with regard to the resource that are granted to the second account by rules created by the first account is provided below with regard to .

Furthermore the software interface implemented by rule database provider may include methods for querying account database . Other methods in the software interface implemented by rule database provider may include one or more methods to write rules to centralized rule database methods to write accounts to account database and methods that provide other functionality.

Security infrastructure in the example of also includes a rule enforcement engine . Rule enforcement engine implements a software interface that includes a rule check method. In one example implementation the rule check method accepts an access token parameter a rights requested parameter and a resource name parameter. The access token parameter accepts an access token of a software process. The rights requested parameter accepts data that indicates a type of right. The resource name parameter indicates a resource of device .

When the rule check method is invoked the rule check method may invoke a method of the software interface implemented by rule database provider to identify an account associated with the chamber indicated by the access token specified by the access token parameter. After identifying the account associated with the chamber the rule check method may invoke the access right query method of the software interface implemented by rule database provider to identify rights provided by rules created under the authority of the TCB account to the identified account with regard to the resource indicated by the resource name parameter of the rule check method.

In response to invoking the access right query method implemented by rule database provider the rule check method of rule enforcement engine may receive a list of rights that specifies rights of processes operating a chamber associated with the identified account to perform actions with regard to the resource indicated by the resource name parameter of the rule check method. The rule check method of rule enforcement engine may then determine whether the rights specified by the rights requested parameter of the rule check method are a subset of the rights specified by the list of rights returned by the access right query method of rule database provider . If the rule check method determines that the rights requested are a subset of the rights specified the list of rights the rule check method may return to the caller of the rule check method a value that indicates that software processes operating in the chamber indicated by the access token have the right to perform the requested action on the requested resource. On the other hand if the rule check method determines that the requested rights are not a subset of the rights specified in the list of rights the rule check method may return to the caller of the rule check method a value that indicates that software processes in the chamber indicated by the access token do not have the right to perform the requested action on the requested resource.

In the example of operating system includes a set of service providers A N collectively service providers . Service providers implement software interfaces that include methods that use protected resources of device . For example one or more of service providers may be system service providers that provide access to system services such as a file system a registry a user interface and so on. In another example service provider B may implement a software interface that enables other software processes to control a modem attached to device . In another example one or more of service providers may provide services other than operating system services. Although not illustrated in the example of one or more of service providers may exist outside of operating system . Service providers may operate in kernel mode or in user mode.

In addition service providers may include a process creation service provider. The process creation service provider implements a software interface that includes one or more methods that when invoked create a new software process. When the process creation service provider creates a new software process the process creation service provider may interact with a token infrastructure to create a new access token for the new software process. In one implementation the new access token for the new software process contains the same information as an access token of a software process that invoked the method of the process creation service provider. Consequently the new software process is not associated with an account that is afforded greater rights than an account that caused the new software process to be created. In other words a software process may not elevate its rights by creating a new software process.

The software interface implemented by the process creation service provider may also include one or more methods that when invoked create a new software thread. The process creation service provider may similarly interact with token infrastructure to create a new access token for the new software thread. The access token for the new software thread may include the same information as an access token of a software process or software thread that invoked the method of the process creation service provider.

Each of service providers that implement a method that performs an action on a protected resource of device invokes the rule check method of rule enforcement engine prior to performing the action on the protected resource. In order to invoke the rule check method of rule enforcement engine service providers may first interact with token infrastructure to retrieve an access token associated with a software process that invoked the method of the service provider. The method of the service provider may then use this access token as a parameter of the rule check method of rule enforcement engine .

One or more of service providers may be responsible for managing resources of device . In some example implementations protected resources are classified into a plurality of types of system services by service providers that manage the resources. In these implementations the canonical names of the protected resources that are classified into different types belong to different hierarchical namespaces. For example service provider A may be a file system manager that is responsible for managing files on a disk drive. In this example the file system manager uses a hierarchical namespace to identify files on the disk drive. For instance the file system manager may use the name C Documents and Settings hk My Documents Resume.doc to identify a particular file on disk drive C. In this example the canonical name of the file may be rule Resources File C Documents and Settings hk My Documents Resume.doc In a second example service provider B may be a registry key manager that manages registry keys. In this second example the registry key manager uses a hierarchical namespace to identify registry keys. In such implementations these ones of service providers may implement canonicalizer methods that translate names in the hierarchical namespaces into canonical names. Furthermore in such implementations these ones of service providers may first use their canonicalizer methods to translate names in their hierarchical namespaces into canonical names. After using the canonicalizer methods to translate names in their hierarchical namespaces into canonical names. These ones of service providers may then invoke the rule check method of rule enforcement engine using the canonical names.

Other ones of service providers may perform actions on system resources that are not identified using hierarchical namespaces. A system resource is a resource that is not specific to any account. For instance system resources such as application programming interfaces APIs privileges and system resources are generally not identified using hierarchical namespace. However such system resources are typically associated with classes and sub classes of objects. For example each system API in Microsoft WINDOWS operating systems has a distinct name. Because such system resources are typically associated with classes and sub classes canonical names can be identified for such system resources by substituting the class names and sub class names into a standard format. For example a canonical name can be identified for a system resource in a class X and a sub class Y by substituting X and Y into the indicated places in the following format 

Because canonical names can be identified for such system resources by simple substitution the rule check method of rule enforcement engine may accept class names and sub class names of system resources in place of canonical names of resources.

Other ones of service providers may perform actions on account specific resources that are not identified using a hierarchical namespace. An account specific resource is a resource that is specific to an account. Like system resources account specific resources are not necessarily identified using hierarchical namespaces. However such account specific resources are typically associated with classes and subject classes. For example a debug process may be operating in a chamber associated with an account Y . In this example the debug process may be in a class of objects named PROCESSES and may be in a sub class named DEBUG . Because such account specific resources are typically associated with classes and sub classes canonical names can be identified for such account specific resources by substituting account names class names and sub class names into a standard format. Continuing the previous example a canonical name can be identified for the debug process by substituting the account identifier the class name and the sub class name into the following format 

Because canonical names can be identified for such account specific resources by simple substitution the rule check method of rule enforcement engine may accept class names and sub class names of account specific resources in place of canonical names of resources.

In some implementations token infrastructure may provide a stack of access tokens to the service provider when the service provider requests the access token of the software process that invoked the method of the service provider. In these implementations the access tokens in the stack of access tokens include the access tokens of each software process and or service provider in a chain of method invocations. For example if a software process A invokes a method implemented by a software process B and the method implemented by software process B invokes a method implemented by service provider A the stack of access tokens may include the access token for software process A and the access token for software process B . In a similar example if a software process A invokes a method implemented by service provider A and the method implemented by service provider A invokes a method implemented by service provider B the stack of access tokens returned by token infrastructure to service provider B may include the access token associated with software process A and the access token associated with service provider A. When service providers receives a stack of access tokens from token infrastructure service providers provide the stack of access tokens as a parameter to the rule check method of rule enforcement engine . The rule check method of rule enforcement engine returns a value that indicates that the service provider is permitted to perform the requested action on the resource only when the accounts associated with the chambers indicated by each of the access tokens in the stack have the right to perform the requested action on the resource. For instance if the stack of access tokens includes a first access token that indicates that account A is permitted to read and write to a file F and the stack of access tokens includes a second access token that indicates a chamber associated with account B is permitted to read to file F then the rule check method does not return a value that indicates that the requesting service provider can write to file F .

After receiving value from the rule check method of rule enforcement engine methods of service providers may perform a variety of actions. For instance when the rule check method returns a value indicating that software processes operating in a chamber associated with an account do not have the right to perform the requested action with regard to a resource methods implemented by service providers may return error messages. On the other hand when the rule check method returns a value indicating that software processes operating in the chamber associated with the account have the right to perform the requested action with regard to the resource the methods of service providers may perform the requested action with regard to the resource.

In the example of device includes a client process that operates in a chamber. Although not illustrated in the example of device may include a large number of client processes. One or more of the other client processes may operate in the same chamber as client process . Client process may be a wide variety of software processes or software threads operating in kernel mode or user mode. Furthermore client process may be a part of operating system or a part of one of software applications . For example client process may be a software process of a word processor application or a video game. In another example client process may be a software process of a malicious application such as computer virus. To use a resource of device client process invokes a method implemented by one of service providers . When client process invokes the method implemented by one of service providers components of operating system and security infrastructure may perform various operations such as the example operation provided below with regard to . Because service providers are responsible for invoking the rule check method of rule enforcement engine it is not necessary to trust client process to check whether it has the right to perform an action with regard to a resource.

It should be understood that client process when operated in different chambers associated with different accounts may or may not be permitted to perform an action with regard to a resource. Accordingly client process should be coded such that client process is able to gracefully handle situations in which client process is not permitted to perform the action with regard to the resource.

As illustrated in the example of rule loader extracts rules in the set of rules from rule documents . As discussed above rule documents contain at least one XML element that represents the each of the rules. After extracting the rules rule loader may store the extracted rules in centralized rule database .

Subsequently client process invokes a method of a software interface implemented by a target service provider that is one of service providers . When invoked the method retrieves an access token associated with client process from token infrastructure .

Next the method of the target service provider invokes a rule check method of rule enforcement engine . When the method invokes the rule check method of rule enforcement engine the method may provide the access token associated with client process to rule enforcement engine as a parameter of the rule check method. Furthermore when the method invokes the rule check method of rule enforcement engine the method may provide to rule enforcement engine the canonical name of a resource as a target resource parameter. This resource may be referred to herein as a target resource. The method may also provide to rule enforcement engine the type of action to be performed on the resource as a requested rights parameter.

After the rule check method is invoked rule enforcement engine invokes an access right query method of rule database provider . Rule enforcement engine may provide as a parameter of the access right query method a query that requests a list of rights that software processes operating in an account associated with the chamber identified by the access token of client process have with regard to a resource identified by the canonical resource name. The list of rights specifies actions that the software processes operating in the chamber associated with the account are allowed to perform with regard to the resource. When invoked the query method of rule database provider uses centralized rule database to generate the list of rights . An example operation to generate the list of rights is provided below with regard to . The query method of rule database provider may then return the list of rights to the rule check method of rule enforcement engine .

When the rule check method of rule enforcement engine receives the list of rights the rule check method determines whether the rights requested by the target service provider are a subset of the rights specified by the list of rights returned by rule database provider . For instance if the list of rights returned by the access right query method of rule database provider does not specify any rights the rule check method may determine that the set of rights requested by client process is not a subset of the rights specified by the list of rights returned by rule database provider . After determining whether the rights requested by the target service provider are a subset of the rights specified by the list of rights returned by rule database provider the rule check method may return to the method of the target service provider a value that indicates whether the account associated with the chamber in which client process operates has the right to perform the action on the resource .

Once the method of the target service provider receives the value the method of the service provider determines whether the value indicates that the account associated with the chamber associated with client process has the right to perform the action on the target resource . If the method of the service provider determines that the value indicates that the account associated with the chamber associated with client process has the right to perform the action on the target resource YES of the method of the target service provider performs the action on the target resource . On the other hand if the method of the target service provider determines that the value indicates that the account associated with the chamber associated with client process does not have the right to perform the action on the target resource NO of the method of the service provider may return an error message to client process .

As illustrated in the example of the operation may begin when rule database provider receives a speaker parameter a resource name parameter and a subject parameter . The speaker parameter indicates an account identifier of a speaker of a rule. The resource name parameter indicates a canonical name of a resource. The subject parameter indicates an account identifier associated with a chamber.

After receiving the parameters rule database provider initializes a rights granted variable a current priority variable and a stop processing flag . When initialized the rights granted variable is a null value the current priority variable is equal to the lowest priority and the stop processing flag is equal to false.

Once rule database provider has initialized the variables rule database provider may query centralized rule database for rules that include a speaker attribute that specifies the account identifier indicated by the speaker parameter and that include a resource name pattern attribute that specifies a resource name pattern that described the canonical name specified by the resource name parameter . The rules returned by this query are referred to herein as the matching rule set. 

After rule database provider receives the matching rule set rule database provider identifies the rules in the matching rule set that include priority attributes that specify a priority equal to the priority indicated by the current priority variable . The rules in the matching rule set that include priority attributes that specify a priority equal to the priority indicated by the current priority variable are referred to herein as the current rule set. 

Next rule database provider determines whether all rules in the current rule set have been evaluated . If not all rules in the current rule set have been evaluated NO of rule database provider may determine whether an unevaluated rule in the current rule set i.e. the current rule includes an authorize property .

If the current rule includes an authorize property YES of rule database provider identifies rights granted by the current rule to the account identified by the account identifier specified by the subject parameter . For example rule database provider may identify READ and WRITE as rights granted by the current rule to the account identified by the account identifier specified by the subject parameter. After identifying the rights granted by the current rule to the account identified by the account identifier specified by the subject parameter rule database provider sets the rights granted variable to the union of the current value of the rights granted variable and the rights granted by the current rule to the account identified by the account identifier specified by the subject parameter .

After setting the rights granted variable or after determining that the current rule does not include an authorized property NO of rule database provider may determine whether the current rule includes a delegation property and the speaker parameter indicates the trusted computing base TCB account . If rule database provider determines that the current rule includes a delegation property and the speaker parameter indicates the TCB account YES of rule database provider may recursively invoke the method of rule database provider to identify rights of an account with regard to a resource . When rule database provider invokes the method rule database provider may use the account identifier specified by the speaker attribute of the current rule as the speaker parameter of the method the resource name specified by the resource name parameter as the resource name parameter of the method and the subject parameter as the subject parameter of the method. After invoking the method rule database provider sets the rights granted variable to the union of the current value of the rights granted variable and the rights returned by the method .

After setting the rights granted variable or after determining that the current rule does not include a delegation property or the speaker parameter does not specify the TCB account NO of rule database provider may determine whether the current rule includes a stop attribute . If the current rule includes a stop attribute YES of rule database provider may determine whether the stop attribute is applicable to the account identified by the account identifier specified by the subject parameter . In one example implementation the stop attribute is applicable to the account identified by the account identifier specified by the subject parameter when the stop attribute is an attribute of an authorize property or a delegate property that includes an account identifier attribute that specifies the account identifier. If the stop attribute is applicable to the account identified by the account identifier specified by the subject parameter YES of rule database provider sets the stop processing flag equal to true .

After setting the stop processing flag or after rule database provider determines that the stop attribute is not applicable to the account identified by the account identifier specified by the subject parameter NO of or after rule database provider determines that the current rule does not include a stop attribute NO of rule database provider may loop back and again determine whether all of the rules in the current rule set have been evaluated and so on.

If all of the rules in the current rule set have been evaluated YES of rule database provider may increment the current priority variable . Next rule database provider may determine whether the current priority variable is equal to a maximum priority value . In one example implementation the maximum priority value is the highest value specified by a priority attribute of any rule in the matching rule set. If the current priority variable is equal to the maximum priority value YES of rule database provider may set the stop processing flag equal to true .

After setting the stop processing flag or after determining that the current priority variable is equal to the maximum priority value NO of rule database provider may determine whether the stop processing flag is set to true . If the stop processing flag is set to true YES of rule database provider may return the rights granted variable . On the other hand if the stop processing flag is not set to true NO of rule database provider may loop back and again identify rules in the matching rule set that include priority attributes that specify the value specified by the current priority variable and so on.

Because of this operation rule enforcement engine determines that one of the rules in centralized rule database grants to the subject account the right to perform the action on the target resource when one of the rules in the first set of rules is associated with a speaker attribute that identifies a TCB account and grants to the subject account the right to perform the action on the target resource. In addition because of this operation rule enforcement engine determines that one of the rules in centralized rule database grants to the subject account the right to perform the action on the target resource when one of the rules in the first set of rules is associated with a speaker attribute that identifies a given account and explicitly grants to the subject account the right to perform the action on the target resources and the second set of rules includes a chain of delegation rules that describes a delegation of rule making authority from the TCB account to the given account.
