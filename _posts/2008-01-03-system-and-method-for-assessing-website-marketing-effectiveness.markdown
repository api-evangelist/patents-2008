title: System and method for assessing website marketing effectiveness
abstract: A system and method are provided for assessing an effectiveness of Internet marketing campaigns, and for providing data gathered thereby to subscribers. The assessment data can be gathered in concert with, for example, private sector partners. Different marketing methods are tested, compared, and evaluated for effectiveness in reaching customers. Equations are provided for calculating such values as probability of conversion of a sale and of a success of a marketing campaign, based upon such factors as user anxiety and external motivation. The data can be used to improve a marketing campaign, and also to inform a subscriber base of techniques found to be effective in Internet sales.

This application claims priority to provisional application Ser. No. 60 883 230 filed on Jan. 3 2007.

The present invention relates to systems and methods for assessing the effectiveness of an Internet marketing campaign and to a method of offering data gathered thereby to subscribers.

The system and method of the present invention are directed to assessing an effectiveness of Internet marketing campaigns and to providing data gathered thereby to subscribers.

The assessment data can be gathered in concert with for example private sector partners. Different marketing methods are tested compared and evaluated for effectiveness in reaching customers. Equations are provided for calculating such values as probability of conversion of a sale and of a success of a marketing campaign based upon such factors as user anxiety and external motivation.

The data can be used to improve a marketing campaign and also to inform a subscriber base of techniques found to be effective in Internet sales.

The features that characterize the invention both as to organization and method of operation together with further objects and advantages thereof will be better understood from the following description used in conjunction with the accompanying drawing. It is to be expressly understood that the drawing is for the purpose of illustration and description and is not intended as a definition of the limits of the invention. These and other objects attained and advantages offered by the present invention will become more fully apparent as the description that now follows is read in conjunction with the accompanying drawing.

A description of the preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be presented with reference to .

In are outlined exemplary steps in a product development cycle from concept to final product which can include market analysis comprising market research competitive analysis and drafting an offer page . Quantitative analysis can include calculating operational metrics and win loss ratios for target consumers . Product strategy can include naming pricing and production strategy buy build or partner . A program strategy is formulated including a launch plan and a support plan . Finally the launch phase includes copywriting offer page s sub path creation A B testing and creation of a final version .

The present invention includes the formulation of equations that can be used to predicting success in a campaign. For example a probability that a viral campaign will succeed can be formulated as 5 . . . where Vis a viral ratio C is contagion M is the underlying message f is the friction mechanism F is a fun factor P is a pride factor and S is a sentimentality factor.

A probability that a business will succeed can be formulated as 2 where S is the probability of success v is the strength and clarity of a value proposition which equals the natural appeal minus the competitive threat o is the opportunity for an increase in conversion t is the amount of untapped cost effective traffic and r is a variable.

A product marketing methodology can be formulated as where Ois product optimization Ois presentation optimization and Ois channel optimization.

A probability that a direct mail campaign will succeed can be formulated as where D is a probability of conversion A is the consumer s attention V is the force of the value proposition M is the motivation to take action and R is the effectiveness of the response funnel.

A micro testing index M calculation can be performed as 3 2 where A R is the testing return on investment where A is the ability to test and R represents the resources required to run the test M is the probability that the test will yield profits i is the strength of the idea being tested Pis the level of optimization of the presentation of the product and Cis the ability to drive cost effective product.

An opportunity assessment can be formulated as 2 where v is a force equal to the natural appeal minus the competitive threat o is the presentation opportunity assessment and t is the channel opportunity assessment. The natural appeal is initially measured through a reverse search study. For partnerships one can examine two key components value proposition and existing channels.

A conversion index calculation can be formulated as 43 2 where C is the probability of conversion m is the motivation of the user v is the clarity of the value proposition i is the incentive to continue f is the friction and a is the user anxiety.

Sub path test elements can be delineated as follows incentive bonuses discounts and contests friction field number field complexity field layout and button design and anxiety relief credibility indicators testimonials third party certification explanatory copy and contact information .

Click through rate CTR can be calculated as CTR int inc where int is the interest curiosity suspense sn is the specific need to complete a process and inc is the incentive to click.

Testing priority can be formulated as 2 where Q is the testing sequence ip is the potential impact it is the time to impact and r represents development resources.

In an exemplary marketing test it was attempted to optimize a landing page. A first objective was to determine whether a small number of specific changes to an offer page would improve overall conversion for a company selling hypnosis products. Multiple variables were tested using the system and method of the present invention using a single factorial A B split testing test design.

The optimized page included improved credibility factors including a photograph credentials and signatures. Greater visibility was given to testimonials and money back guarantee was included. An overall improvement rate of 40.7 was observed. Additional improvement 39.0 was made by removing the photograph from the landing page. Thus it can be seen that the system and method of the present invention can provide data valuable in improving sales for Internet marketing.

In a method of doing business using the present invention a subscription can be offered to companies which provides data gleaned from marketing experiments such as outlined above. Subscribers are also offered the opportunity to participate in web clinics on marketing techniques. Further research partners can be joined with to conduct tests for their particular products services.

In the foregoing description certain terms have been used for brevity clarity and understanding but no unnecessary limitations are to be implied therefrom beyond the requirements of the prior art because such words are used for description purposes herein and are intended to be broadly construed. Moreover the embodiments of the apparatus illustrated and described herein are by way of example and the scope of the invention is not limited to the exact details of construction.

Having now described the invention the construction the operation and use of preferred embodiments thereof and the advantageous new and useful results obtained thereby the new and useful constructions and reasonable mechanical equivalents thereof obvious to those skilled in the art are set forth in the appended claims.
