Phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase PI3K mediates the signal from various growth factors to regulate cell proliferation and survival. A Serine Threonine Ser Thr or S T protein kinase termed Akt is identified as a downstream target of PI3 kinase. This protein kinase is recruited to the cell membrane by interaction of its pleckstrin homology domain with PI3K products phosphatidylinositol 3 4 5 triphosphate PIPS and phosphatidylinositol 3 4 diphosphate PIP where it is activated by phosphorylation of its catalytic domain by 3 Phosphoinositide dependent Kinase 1 PDK 1 . Akt is further activated by phosphorylation of a serine in its C terminal hydrophobic motif by another kinase PDK 2 . The activation of Akt acts downstream to regulate additional kinases many of which are implicated in cellular processes that control survival proliferation metabolism and growth translation. PI3K can also drive cellular processes that impact transformation cellular proliferation cytoskeletal rearrangement and survival through a parallel pathway that does not involve Akt Hennessy et al. 4 988 1004 2005 . Two of these pathways are activation of the small GTP binding proteins Cdc42 and Rac1 and activation of the serum and glucocorticoid inducible kinase SGK . Cdc42 and Rac1 which regulate cytoskeletal movement and cell motility and can function as oncogenes when over expressed are also linked to the RAS pathway. Thus PI3K activity generates 3 phosphatidylinositol lipids that act as a nodal point to stimulate a diversity of downstream signaling pathways.

That these pathways impact cellular properties proliferation survival motility and morphology that are often disrupted in cancer proliferative diseases thrombotic diseases and inflammation among others dictates that compounds inhibiting PI3K and isoforms thereof have utility either as a single agent or in combination in the treatment of these diseases. In cancer deregulation of the PI3K Akt pathway is extensively documented including overexpression of the PIK3 CA gene activating mutations of the PIK3 CA gene overexpression of Akt mutations of PDK 1 and deletions inactivation of PTEN Parsons et al. 436 792 2005 Hennessy et al. 4 988 2005 Stephens et al. 5 1 2005 Bonneau and Longy 16 109 2000 and Ali et al. 91 1922 1999 . Recent findings indicate that PIK3CA is frequently mutated 30 in various solid tumors in humans Samuels and Ericson 18 77 2005 and the most frequent of these mutations promote cell growth and invasion Samuels et al. 7 561 2005 and are transforming Kang et al. 102 802 2005 Zhao et al. 102 18443 2005 . Thus inhibitors of PI3K particularly of the p110a isoform encoded by PIK3CA and its mutations will be useful in the treatment of cancers driven by these mutations and deregulations.

However while EGFR inhibitors demonstrate anti tumor activity in certain human tumors e.g. NSCLC they fail to increase overall patient survival in all patients with EGFR expressing tumors. This may be rationalized by the fact that many downstream targets of Her1 EGFR are mutated or deregulated at high frequencies in a variety of malignancies including the PI3K Akt pathway. For example gefitinib inhibits the growth of an adenocarcinoma cell line in in vitro assays. Nonetheless sub clones of these cell lines can be selected that are resistant to gefitinib that demonstrate increased activation of the PI3 Akt pathway. Down regulation or inhibition of this pathway renders the resistant sub clones sensitive to gefitinib Kokubo et al. Brit. J. Cancer 92 1711 2005 . Furthermore in an in vitro model of breast cancer with a cell line that harbors a PTEN mutation and over expresses EGFR inhibition of both the PI3K Akt pathway and EGFR produced a synergistic effect She et al. Cancer Cell 8 287 297 2005 . These results indicate that the combination of gefitinib and PI3K Akt pathway inhibitors would be an attractive therapeutic strategy in cancer.

The combination of AEE778 an inhibitor of Her 2 neu ErbB2 VEGFR and EGFR and RAD001 an inhibitor of mTOR a downstream target of Akt produced greater combined efficacy that either agent alone in a glioblastoma xenograft model Goudar et al. 4 101 112 2005 .

Anti estrogens such as tamoxifen inhibit breast cancer growth through induction of cell cycle arrest that requires the action of the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip. Recently it has been shown that activation of the Ras Raf MAP Kinase pathway alters the phosphorylation status of p27Kip such that its inhibitory activity in arresting the cell cycle is attenuated thereby contributing to anti estrogen resistance Donovan et al 276 40888 2001 . As reported by Donovan et al. inhibition of MAPK signaling through treatment with MEK inhibitor reversed the aberrant phosphorylation status of p27 in hormone refractory breast cancer cell lines and in so doing restored hormone sensitivity. Similarly phosphorylation of p27Kip by Akt also abrogates its role to arrest the cell cycle Viglietto et al. 8 1145 2002 . Accordingly in one aspect the compounds as defined herein may be used in the treatment of hormone dependent cancers such as breast and prostate cancers to reverse hormone resistance commonly seen in these cancers with conventional anticancer agents.

In hematological cancers such as chronic myelogenous leukemia CML chromosomal translocation is responsible for the constitutively activated BCR Abl tyrosine kinase. The afflicted patients are responsive to imatinib a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor as a result of inhibition of Abl kinase activity. However many patients with advanced stage disease respond to imatinib initially but then relapse later due to resistance conferring mutations in the Abl kinase domain. In vitro studies have demonstrated that BCR Ab1 employs the Ras Raf kinase pathway to elicit its effects. In addition inhibiting more than one kinase in the same pathway provides additional protection against resistance conferring mutations. Accordingly in another aspect of the embodiments the compounds as defined herein are used in combination with at least one additional agent such as Gleevec in the treatment of hematological cancers such as chronic myelogenous leukemia CML to reverse or prevent resistance to at least one additional agent.

Because activation of the PI3K Akt pathway drives cell survival inhibition of the pathway in combination with therapies that drive apoptosis in cancer cells including radiotherapy and chemotherapy will result in improved responses Ghobrial et al. CA 55 178 194 2005 . As an example combination of PI3 kinase inhibitor with carboplatin demonstrated synergistic effects in both in vitro proliferation and apoptosis assays as well as in in vivo tumor efficacy in a xenograft model of ovarian cancer Westfall and Skinner 4 1764 1771 2005 .

In addition to cancer and proliferative diseases there is accumulating evidence that inhibitors of Class 1A and 1B PI3 kinases would be therapeutically useful in others disease areas. The inhibition of p110 the PI3K isoform product of the PIK3CB gene has been shown to be involved in shear induced platelet activation Jackson et al. 11 507 514 2005 . Thus a PI3K inhibitor that inhibits p110 would be useful as a single agent or in combination in anti thrombotic therapy. The isoform p110 the product of the PIK3CD gene is important in B cell function and differentiation Clayton et al. 196 753 763 2002 T cell dependent and independent antigen responses Jou et al. 22 8580 8590 2002 and mast cell differentiation Ali et al. 431 1007 1011 2004 . Thus it is expected that p110 inhibitors would be useful in the treatment of B cell driven autoimmune diseases and asthma. Finally the inhibition of p110 the isoform product of the PI3KCG gene results in reduced T but not B cell response Reif et al. 173 2236 2240 2004 and its inhibition demonstrates efficacy in animal models of autoimmune diseases Camps et al. 11 936 943 2005 Barber et al. 11 933 935 2005 .

In another aspect of the preferred embodiments kits that include one or more compounds of the preferred embodiments are provided. Representative kits include a PI3K inhibitor compound of the preferred embodiments e.g. a compound as defined herein and a package insert or other labeling including directions for treating a cellular proliferative disease by administering a PI3K inhibitory amount of the compound.

In general the compounds of preferred embodiments will be administered in a therapeutically effective amount by any of the accepted modes of administration for agents that serve similar utilities. The actual amount of the compound of preferred embodiments i.e. the active ingredient will depend upon numerous factors such as the severity of the disease to be treated the age and relative health of the subject the potency of the compound used the route and form of administration and other factors. The drug can be administered more than once a day preferably once or twice a day. All of these factors are within the skill of the attending clinician.

Therapeutically effective amounts of compounds as defined herein may range from about 0.05 to about 50 mg per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day preferably about 0.1 25 mg kg day more preferably from about 0.5 to 10 mg kg day. Thus for administration to a 70 kg person the dosage range would most preferably be about 35 70 mg per day.

In general compounds of the preferred embodiments will be administered as pharmaceutical compositions by any one of the following routes oral systemic e.g. transdermal intranasal or by suppository or parenteral e.g. intramuscular intravenous or subcutaneous administration. The preferred manner of administration is oral using a convenient daily dosage regimen that can be adjusted according to the degree of affliction. Compositions can take the form of tablets pills capsules semisolids powders sustained release formulations solutions suspensions elixirs aerosols or any other appropriate compositions. Another preferred manner for administering compounds of the preferred embodiments is inhalation. This is an effective method for delivering a therapeutic agent directly to the respiratory tract see U.S. Pat. No. 5 607 915 .

The choice of formulation depends on various factors such as the mode of drug administration and bioavailability of the drug substance. For delivery via inhalation the compound can be formulated as liquid solution suspensions aerosol propellants or dry powder and loaded into a suitable dispenser for administration. There are several types of pharmaceutical inhalation devices nebulizer inhalers metered dose inhalers MDI and dry powder inhalers DPI . Nebulizer devices produce a stream of high velocity air that causes the therapeutic agents which are formulated in a liquid form to spray as a mist that is carried into the patient s respiratory tract. MDI s typically are formulation packaged with a compressed gas. Upon actuation the device discharges a measured amount of therapeutic agent by compressed gas thus affording a reliable method of administering a set amount of agent. DPI dispenses therapeutic agents in the form of a free flowing powder that can be dispersed in the patient s inspiratory air stream during breathing by the device. In order to achieve a free flowing powder the therapeutic agent is formulated with an excipient such as lactose. A measured amount of the therapeutic agent is stored in a capsule form and is dispensed with each actuation.

Recently pharmaceutical formulations have been developed especially for drugs that show poor bioavailability based upon the principle that bioavailability can be increased by increasing the surface area i.e. decreasing particle size. For example U.S. Pat. No. 4 107 288 describes a pharmaceutical formulation having particles in the size range from 10 to 1 000 nm in which the active material is supported on a crosslinked matrix of macromolecules. U.S. Pat. No. 5 145 684 describes the production of a pharmaceutical formulation in which the drug substance is pulverized to nanoparticles average particle size of 400 nm in the presence of a surface modifier and then dispersed in a liquid medium to give a pharmaceutical formulation that exhibits remarkably high bioavailability.

The compositions are comprised of in general a compound as defined herein in combination with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Acceptable excipients are non toxic aid administration and do not adversely affect the therapeutic benefit of the compound as defined herein. Such excipient may be any solid liquid semi solid or in the case of an aerosol composition gaseous excipient that is generally available to one of skill in the art.

Solid pharmaceutical excipients include starch cellulose talc glucose lactose sucrose gelatin malt rice flour chalk silica gel magnesium stearate sodium stearate glycerol monostearate sodium chloride dried skim milk and the like. Liquid and semisolid excipients may be selected from glycerol propylene glycol water ethanol and various oils including those of petroleum animal vegetable or synthetic origin e.g. peanut oil soybean oil mineral oil sesame oil etc. Preferred liquid carriers particularly for injectable solutions include water saline aqueous dextrose and glycols.

Compressed gases may be used to disperse a compound of the preferred embodiments in aerosol form. Inert gases suitable for this purpose are nitrogen carbon dioxide etc. Other suitable pharmaceutical excipients and their formulations are described in Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences edited by E. W. Martin Mack Publishing Company 18th ed. 1990 .

The amount of the compound in a formulation can vary within the full range employed by those skilled in the art. Typically the formulation will contain on a weight percent wt basis from about 0.01 99.99 wt of a compound as defined herein based on the total formulation with the balance being one or more suitable pharmaceutical excipients. Preferably the compound is present at a level of about 1 80 wt .

The compounds of preferred embodiments can be prepared from readily available starting materials using the following general methods and procedures. It will be appreciated that where typical or preferred process conditions i.e. reaction temperatures times mole ratios of reactants solvents pressures etc. are given other process conditions can also be used unless otherwise stated. Optimum reaction conditions may vary with the particular reactants or solvent used but such conditions can be determined by one skilled in the art by routine optimization procedures.

Additionally as will be apparent to those skilled in the art conventional protecting groups may be necessary to prevent certain functional groups from undergoing undesired reactions. Suitable protecting groups for various functional groups as well as suitable conditions for protecting and deprotecting particular functional groups are well known in the art. For example numerous protecting groups are described in T. W. Greene and G. M. Wuts Third Edition Wiley New York 1999 and references cited therein.

Furthermore the compounds of preferred embodiments contain one or more chiral centers. Accordingly if desired such compounds can be prepared or isolated as pure stereoisomers i.e. as individual enantiomers or diastereomers or as stereoisomer enriched mixtures. All such stereoisomers and enriched mixtures are included within the scope of the preferred embodiments unless otherwise indicated. Pure stereoisomers or enriched mixtures may be prepared using for example optically active starting materials or stereoselective reagents well known in the art. Alternatively racemic mixtures of such compounds can be separated using for example chiral column chromatography chiral resolving agents and the like.

The starting materials for the following reactions are generally known compounds or can be prepared by known procedures or obvious modifications thereof. For example many of the starting materials are available from commercial suppliers such as Aldrich Chemical Co. Milwaukee Wis. USA Bachem Torrance Calif. USA Emka Chem or Sigma St. Louis Mo. USA . Others may be prepared by procedures or obvious modifications thereof described in standard reference texts such as Fieser and Fieser s Volumes 1 15 John Wiley and Sons 1991 Rodd s Volumes 1 5 and Supplementals Elsevier Science Publishers 1989 Volumes 1 40 John Wiley and Sons 1991 March s John Wiley and Sons 4th Edition and Larock s VCH Publishers Inc. 1989 .

The various starting materials intermediates and compounds of the preferred embodiments may be isolated and purified where appropriate using conventional techniques such as precipitation filtration crystallization evaporation distillation and chromatography. Characterization of these compounds may be performed using conventional methods such as by melting point mass spectrum nuclear magnetic resonance and various other spectroscopic analyses.

Compounds of preferred embodiments can be made by employing palladium mediated coupling reactions such as Suzuki coupling. Said couplings can be employed to functionalize a heterocycle or aryl ring system at each position of the ring system providing said ring is suitably activated or functionalized.

Suzuki coupling Suzuki et al. . 1979 866 can be used to form the final product and can be effected under known conditions such as by treatment with functionalized boronic esters as in the following schemes 

The pyridinyl or pyrimidinyl cores can be obtained commercially and functionalized. The pyridinyl or pyrimidinyl cores can comprise substituents that can be converted to desired functional groups.

The compounds of the invention were synthesized according to the examples provided above. PI3K inhibitory IC values of the compounds were determined according to Biological Method 1.

Each of the compounds screened in Table 1 exhibited an ICvalue of less than about 25 M with respect to inhibition of PI3K. Many of the Examples of Table 1 exhibited ICvalues of less than about 10 M and less than about 1 M and even less than about 0.1 M with respect to inhibition of PI3K. For this reason each of the compounds is individually preferred and preferred as a member of a group.

Compounds to be tested are dissolved in DMSO and directly distributed into 384 well flashplates at 1.25 L per well. To start the reaction 20 L of 6 nM PI3 kinase are added into each well followed by 20 L of 400 nM ATP containing a trace of radiolabeled ATP and 900 nM 1 alpha phosphatidylinositol PI . The plates are briefly centrifuged to remove any air gap. The reaction is performed for 15 minutes and then stopped by the addition of 20 L of 100 mM EDTA. The stopped reaction is incubated overnight at RT to allow the lipid substrate to bind by hydrophobic interaction to the surface of the flashplate. The liquid in the wells is then washed away and the labeled substrate is detected with scintillation counting.

This method is similar to Assay 1 except that the lipid substrate 1 alpha phosphatidylinositol PI is first dissolved in a coating buffer and incubated on flashplate at room temperature overnight to allow the lipid substrate to bind by hydrophobic interaction to the surface of the flashplate. Unbound substrate is then washed away. On the day of assay 20 L of 6 nM PI3 kinase are added into each well followed by 20 L of 400 nM ATP containing trace of radiolabeled ATP. Compounds are added together with enzyme and ATP to the lipid coated plates. The plates are briefly centrifuged to remove any air gap. The reaction is performed for two to three hours. The reaction is stopped by addition of 20 L of 100 mM EDTA or by immediate plate washing. Phosphorylated lipid substrate is detected by scintillation counting.

Compounds to be tested are dissolved in DMSO and directly distributed into a black 384 well plate at 1.25 L per well. To start the reaction 25 L of 10 nM PI3 kinase and 5 g mL 1 alpha phosphatidylinositol PI are added into each well followed by 25 L of 2 M ATP. The reaction is performed until approx 50 of the ATP is depleted and then stopped by the addition of 25 L of KinaseGlo solution. The stopped reaction is incubated for 5 minutes and the remaining ATP is then detected via luminescence.

In this method an assay for measuring the PI3K mediated pSer Akt status after treatment with representative inhibitor compounds of the preferred embodiments is described.

A2780 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 FBS. L glutamine sodium pyruvate and antibiotics. Cells were plated in the same medium at a density of 15 000 cells per well into 96 well tissue culture plates with outside wells vacant and allowed to adhere overnight.

Test compounds supplied in DMSO were diluted further into DMSO at 500 times the desired final concentrations before dilution into culture media to 2 times the final concentrations. Equal volumes of 2 compounds were added to the cells in 96 well plates and incubated at 37 C. for one hour. The media and compounds were then removed the plates chilled and cells lysed in a lysis buffer 150 mM NaCl 20 mM Tris pH 7.5 1 mM EDTA 1 mM EGTA 1 Triton X 100 supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors. After thorough mixing lysates were transferred to both pSer473Akt and total Akt assay plates from Meso Scale Discovery MSD and incubated overnight with shaking at 4 C. The plates were washed with 1 MSD wash buffer and the captured analytes detected with secondary antibodies. After incubation with the secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 2 hours the plates were washed again and 1.5 concentration of Read Buffer T MSD was added to the wells.

The assays were read on a SECTOR Imager 6000 instrument Meso Scale Discovery . Ratios of the signal from pSer473Akt and total Akt assays were used to correct for any variability and the percent inhibition of pSer473Akt from the total signal seen in cells treated with compound versus DMSO alone was calculated and used to determine ECvalues for each compound.

While a number of preferred embodiments of the invention and variations thereof have been described in detail other modifications and methods of use within the scope of the claims appended hereto will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art.
