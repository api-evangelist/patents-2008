This Utility Application claims priority from Provisional Patent Application 60 970 767 filed on Sep. 7 2007 and incorporates said application in its totality herein by reference.

Portions of the disclosure of this patent document contain material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

The accurate description of a digital object is vital to its preservation discovery management and distribution. Even though a schema such as for instance the Dublin Core may be used to provide a generally accepted standard for an accurate description of an object the description is intentionally limited by the schema itself. Therefore to adhere to this standard does not provide the possibility of either a very broad or very granular detailed description metadata of the object.

Cataloging schema also has inherited limitations. For example information collected within a schema is limited by the subjective perspective of the cataloger or to the domain in which the cataloger is a recognized expert. Although a domain expert may be a recognized with regard to a particular object or object type he may not have an extensive knowledge of for example a historic perspective of the class to which the object type belongs. Additionally the cataloging process itself may be strictly limited in scope perhaps due to limited resources thus the policy adopted to catalog the objects may also be limiting by design.

Digital object representation is becoming increasingly significant in the distribution of product information. That is to say the effective dissemination of information related to products for instance through search engines has become one of the primary means of its distribution with the World Wide Web representing one of the primary channels of distribution of this information and a market of exchange for the information and commerce. This represents what can be called the semantic market place . So as objects are now in part distributed through the effectiveness of their digital representations the construction of these representations is becoming increasingly significant. With the advent of semantic technologies which permit the extraction of this information and reasoning related to the information extracted the construction of detailed semantic representations of digital objects semantic digital objects or SDO represents a significant challenge for ensuring an efficient distribution of the digital objects for instance utilizing an improved organic search engine indexing for retrieval of the objects by the next generation of semantic and meta semantic search engines.

The inventive system described herein addresses these issues with an application for a complete value chain for the creation of information enriched Digital Objects referred to here as Semantic Digital Objects or SDO. The application implements a multi schematic and multi layered approach to metadata management ontologies thesauri and controlled vocabularies to create polyhierarchical semantic representations. This multi layered approach refers to a multi level multi level Digital Object DO submission process creating three semantic versions for each object. Also described herein are two marketing methods referred to as semantic marketing methods Semantic or Metasemantic Advertising and Quantistic Marketing which utilizes the polyhierarchical Semantic Digital Objects SDO produced by the platform to provide and locate associated detailed product descriptions such as information relating to a product s brand company cultural context historical context historic context among others or a combination thereof and enhancing their representation to improve the likelihood of a potential consumer finding the product he wants to purchase or research. This list is not exclusive.

This invention relates to the creation of a software application to facilitate the creation representation and publication of Digital Objects DO in particular methods and apparatus that improve digital resource retrieval on the part of end users and to provide a new system for the web based marketing of digital assets and the online distribution of metadata enriched advertising.

The present invention is described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may however be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein rather these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art.

Referring to the current invention relates to a software application to facilitate the creation representation and publication of Digital Objects. The invention improves digital resource retrieval on the part of end users and represents a new system for the web based marketing of digital assets and the online distribution of metadata enriched advertising.

The software application creates polyhierarchical descriptions of digital objects by consolidating concepts into broader contexts to augment potential sources of associations referred to in this document as semantic pointers for improved SEO search engine optimizations of simple DOs digital objects .

The software application has a Portal Management System PMS a Metadata Centric Content Management System CMS and a thematic portal subject gateway referred to here as Advertising Arts ADARTS which has been developed so that said Digital Objects can be used for an exemplary marketing method described herein.

Referring to the inventive system comprises three sequential macro phases Cataloging Authoring and Publication each represented by its respective software component utilized during the description enrichment and distribution of Digital Objects.

Each macro phase comprises various micro phases with their respective software modules. Referring to and the component dedicated to the description of Digital Objects during the Archiving phase is referred to here as the Cataloger or POLYCAT. The Cataloger is a digital repository front end created to enable a polyhierarchical multi schema approach to cataloging.

Referring to FIGS. and the component dedicated to the enrichment of Digital Objects during the Authoring phase is referred to here as A Digital Asset Management System ADAMS . It is a Digital Object aggregator and disseminator used to facilitate the construction and representation of Complex Digital Objects CDO .

Referring to and the final component described here utilized during the Publication phase interprets the complex Semantic Digital Object SDO assembled in ADAMS and transforms it into XHTML for a web based distribution ADARTS portal management system.

These three macro phases are embodied by three macro software components which respond to the requirements of each of the three macro phases. The three macro software components are 

Referring generally to and the cataloging process begins with an analysis of cataloging requirements object type and collection description which is deconstructed into potential Points of View POV to utilize during the cataloging process. The relevant POVs are then constructed if not already available in preconfigured metadata scheme Dublin Core defining the domain of each point of view and utilizing authorities like ontologies thesauri and controlled vocabularies.

The inventive system manages multiple user repositories permitting users to archive multiple collections. User level and collection level metadata is registered for each user and their collections along with relevant metadata for each Point of View POV selected for the cataloging process. At this point a multi level Digital Object DO submission process consisting of the creation of three semantic versions for each DO can begin 

The Digital Object now has three semantic representations. Each of these three representations can be utilized in different processes and in different ways for example for enrichment for search retrieval and for distribution. Each of these three semantic representations also creates a type of semantic handle which can be utilized by different applications in different systems and in different ways alone or in combination.

Interoperability between TM and RDF is achieved using URIs universal resource identifier so the same Complex Digital Object CDO can be represented by the same URI in all of its representations. The FEDORA URI representing the actual digital object image or multimedia document can be different from the one representing the identity of the object used in the RDF graph . However the connection between the two is represented by means of a property of the RDF TM representation of the DO. The solution adopted is to incorporate in the URI the name of the server which provides the referencing to the objects.

The aim of this multi layered approach is to offer the best possible qualitatively and quantitatively semantic representation of digital content and its metadata for distribution across network channels today and in the future. And these three approaches and their related applications represent the most promising technologies on the horizon.

Although there are applications which map merge align and crosswalk between different metadata systems or ontologies or data formats information is lost at each stage. Adopting this multi layered approach provides the greatest data fidelity.

As the market place is becoming semantic detailed semantic resource description is essential for asset utilization in future semantic applications. It is neither desirable prudent or obligatory to adopt a one level approach.

Adopting a multilayered approach equates to preparing digital assets for a complete method of distribution through multiple channels including but not limited to for example the World Wide Web intra nets cellular among others. The sum is also greater than the parts offering services and capacities that no single system offers.

The inventive system described combines three different approaches into one synchronized Digital Object DO cataloging systems in order to create the richest possible representation of a DO. This creates the possibility of a multifaceted approach to search described as a meta semantic search in the exemplary application called Advertising Arts ADARTS .

Referring generally to and the software component described here details the creation of a flexible multi faceted and polyhierarchical cataloging system that facilitates the qualified description of DOs from multiple Point of Views POV . The description of a DO as a construction of multiple Point of Views POV offers two principle advantages one to create an enriched end user experience and two to provide a structure for the creating links to associated content of other semantically cataloged resources. The purpose of multiple POVs is to provide a more accurate and detailed description of interesting aspects of an object and to create pointers to associated resources. The Cataloger component comprises modules for 

This module manages the metadata cataloging schema templates and the associate workflow including their addition to the system their validation and their management from within the Cataloger component. The Metadata Schema Management Module permits a flexible structure for schema management necessary for the creation of catalog entries with multiple POVs or polyhierarchical cataloging for the construction of polyhierarchical representations of DOs.

Standard schema include technical data the product information the descriptive data and e commerce data. Each metadata schema represents a class that can be used to build a Point of View POV . Each metadata schema template is validated before it can be utilized by the system. Schema creators such as data regarding authors of the metadata schema template domain experts are linked to the schema itself and all operations on the schema catalogers are logged into the system. Any modification of a metadata schema template generates a new version of the schema itself and must follow a revision and validation process before it substitute for the published version.

Whenever available for any given POV authorities such as domain ontologies thesaurus or controlled vocabularies are utilized controlled data input fields. When an authority is not available a descriptive field can be utilized to annotate a POV.

This module permits the creation of POV related to an object and its management within the Cataloger component. A typical POV is constructed utilizing an ontology consisting of several metadata schema templates. These are needed in order to generate a Point of View Instance associated to the object being cataloged.

The metadata schema template represents the class and subclasses that build that are represented by the ontology. It is possible to customize the POV ontology adding new data and object properties to the classes.

Different POVs of the same information sources are represented as domain ontologies related to the reference ontology DOLCE which describes the data source vocabulary. Third party applications only see the POV ontology while the internal query engine takes the advantage of the whole representation.

A POV can vary from a simple descriptive note or annotation added to a standard schema by a domain expert to the definition of a POV class consisting of multiple subclasses.

Contains a descriptive definition of the POV identifying and utilizing domain ontologies thesauri and controlled vocabularies when possible and available and their relationship with other surrounding vertical middle and domain and horizontal higher or foundations ontologies being utilized and related thesauri and controlled vocabularies. In the absence of adequate domain ontologies domain thesauri or controlled vocabularies domain experts are responsible for creating a detailed description of the domain citing key references which can be utilized to extract key concepts and descriptions relating to the domain. This is accomplished by the domain expert utilizing the schema for domain expert POV creator.

Create ontology using metadata schema templates as class and subclass of the ontology and add additional POV domain specific fields and relations as necessary.

POV Instance is an instance of a POV ontology that has been used to catalog semantically the DO in the POV.

The domain ontology POV can also describe a class of objects or collection which can be used to define and describe a time base process relationship or historic perspective for each member of this POV collection and its relationship with the other members of the collection. This is referred to here as a phylogenic classification and is utilized to create a semantic timeline of a particular POV collection and its members.

A POV collections level descriptive field is used to describe the class of members this description is inherited by each member of the collection to which is added the specific description of the role or place of each DO within the time based process described. This description of the DO under study is then collocated between what has become before and after permitting it to be located descriptively along a timeline representation. Because a DO can be described by multiple POVs a DO can be a member of multiple POV collections and situated along multiple timelines permitting a time based tracking of features and functions of a collection for each POV created.

POV ontologies are connected to other upper ontologies and middle ontologies DOLCE that permits the joining of all semantic information together. Available ontologies are subdivided into upper ontology middle ontology and domain ontology. These ontologies are structured in hierarchic mode. There is an upper ontology that connects the sub ontologies named middle ontology. Middle ontologies connect sub ontology named domain ontology specific for each domains. In some cases the last ontology can be represented by the POV. Each POV could be connected to other POV to allow semantic cataloging.

The Administrator sets the POV policy to provide the user cataloger or domain expert with access to create the POV Instance. Any POV is revised and validated before it is published into the semantic repository allowing its utilization for semantic cataloging. Data regarding authors of the POV are linked to the schema itself and all operations on the POV are logged into the system.

Any modification of a POV generates a new version of the POV itself that must follow the revision and validation process before it substitutes the published version. A POV can grow in time and all objects automatically inherit new information.

The core module of the Cataloger for the submission includes various metadata schema which include schema for the management of multiple languages rights management and preservation. The system also includes the schema for the registration of various points of view of an object or their POV.

When a user submits an object into the Cataloger POLYCAT he first must choose at least one POV ontology to describe it. In this way a POV instance is added to the Cataloger for each POV used to describe an object. Each new POV instance is added separately from the POV ontology. The user must add an object representation of the digital object that he wants to catalog e.g. image audio pdf doc . The system will automatically extract technical information from the surrogates and store them into the object as technical metadata. All metadata related to the community of the user are inherited during object submission. Each user is guided through the cataloging process for his or her particular expertise and POV using dedicated ontologies.

Each POV instance is composed of several metadata schema template that represents the user s classes and subclasses so the user is guided to fill schema with data using fields controlled by the appropriate authorities ontologies thesauri and or controlled vocabularies when possible. Users authorized to submit new information into POV can create several instances of POV for entering new information. Any DO is revised and validated before it is published into semantic repository for their utilization. Data regarding authors of the object are linked to the DO itself and all operations on the DO are logged into the system. Any modification of a DO generates a new version of the DO itself that must follow the revision and validation process before it substitutes for the published version.

The process of creating high quality metadata for each DO begins at the moment of submission. The Cataloger is a software component utilized during the Archiving phase of the project and sits on top of the repository FEDORA . The Cataloger can also catalog objects into multiple digital repositories and is not limited in any way to the FEDORA digital repository. This cataloging component utilizes separate modules for the cataloging of an object from different perspectives or POVs. Each of these modules consists of its associated schema for metadata input. These schema are used to create multi faceted and polyhierarchical catalog entries with schema fields linked to available authorities such as ontologies thesauri and controlled vocabularies. Exemplary schema would include schema for multi language descriptive metadata annotations bibliographic references product related information e commerce information and technical information for instance related to an image file among others. This is a key aspect of the inventive semantic approach to the creation of information enriched digital assets and begins a value chain by building quality semantic handles for the DOs.

During the Enrichment phase these DOs can be further enriched with links to correlated information selected from trusted content providers. Enrichment here implies the process of adding semantic value to a DO by providing different possible contexts from which to consider the DO offering the end user the opportunity for a deeper and or broader study of the DO.

Enrichment is an integral part of the cataloging architecture utilized permitting metadata annotations to the DOs in the collection by qualified experts in various fields as well as associating external content images videos articles and their metadata. This enables the creation of an unlimited network of interrelated detailed information associated to a DO Complex Digital Object .

Upon ingestion into the digital repository DR each DO inherits the administration and collections level metadata associated with its account and account type. Depending on its DO type ex. image audio video text each media asset is assigned the appropriate descriptive metadata a unique universal identifier copyright and usage permission are registered. This permits a complete audit history including the tracking of every user transaction modification to each asset and each user interaction.

The structure of the POV of a parent object is built upon a POV model which includes the following elements 

The structured metadata of every POV consists of an aggregation of default scheme for the registration of metadata. These include 

This approach permits for example the creation of historic POV collections of groups of instances. For each POVs cataloged an object can form part of a respective collection. Utilizing a single instance collection the user can also create a collection relating to the different phases of a creative process related to the creation of an object from a given POV. If an object is seen as the end product of a series of production processes the description of the process can also be considered a collection.

To generate semantic timeline navigation of POV instances for example within a web based distribution channel s image gallery or search each Point of View needs to be considered as a composed of a collection of Digital Object instances linked to that particular POV within a time based or historic perspective. This is referred to here as a phylogenic classification and it is utilized to create a semantic timeline of a particular POV. This means that a POV Type Collection descriptive field needs to describe how the object under study is related to what has come before and after. This is placed descriptively on the POV timeline. This permits a time based tracking of features and functions of a collection for each point of view created.

A browser based repository interface permits the addition of future annotations tagging citations and bibliographic references for each digital original by authorized repository users and folksonomies by portal end users.

The Cataloger is composed of a cataloging component which utilizes separate modules for the cataloging of different representations of each object. Each of these modules consists of its associated schema for data input.

The user Administrator creates account types user types and the associated cataloging privileges for each. The Administrator can assign one or more DOI domains or handles to an account. The domains once assigned are utilized for all DOs cataloged into the account for the identification. The LDAP server ref 0.6 is utilized for the management of users and user groups. This module will provide universal identifiers for users based on the PID unique persistent identifier for a Fedora digital object Generator of FEDORA and the CNRI Corporation for National Research Initiatives handle server ref. 14 .

The administrator has a wide range of options available regarding the policies which can be set to define cataloging privileges. The system which manages the policies is divided into two parts the first manages the assignment of services to each level of user depending on their authorization the second manages the policies related to the repository access privileges.

For the development of the first part of the policy system the LDAP server OpenLDAP ref. 6 is utilized which will carry out a census of the Cataloger services and the access policies to establish the access privileges for a user or group of users.

The XACML standard is utilized for the development of the second part of the policy management system which will be used to configure the policies of FEDORA in combination with the attributes of LDAP. A component is used to dynamically integrate the policy management of FEDORA with the user authentication of LDAP. Policies are assigned by the administrator for communities and collections. The collections inherit the policies assigned to communities. The DOs cataloged in the collections will likewise inherit the policies of the collection and community.

The administrator assigns users and groups of users areas within the repository for publication called communities . Within each community the administrator can assign collections in which each user or group of users can catalog objects. To realize this function we will develop a collection ingestion module which will permit the creation of collections and sub collections within FEDORA utilizing the Fedora Relationship Ontology ref. 1O based on the RDFS standard ref. 11 . Once the administrator has created a collection the access policy for the collection and its related community is also assigned.

An example of preloaded default schema for cataloging utilized in the Cataloger DCMI Type Vocabulary rel. 1 would include 

Each schema utilized by the Cataloger undergoes the process of creation validation and approval before being implemented. Once approved each schema is also cataloged. The administrator catalogs the ontology of the OWL Web Ontology Language file rel. 16 prepared with Protege rel. 9 and uses this to associate the relative schema. The auditing system permits the administrator to monitor the use of the schema.

The administrator can create and audit the activities and privileges of different categories of catalogers for different schema and portions of schema. For any operation carried out by users of the Cataloger the schema is monitored with audits stored in the Catalogers database. This permits the administrator a complete audit of all activity within the Cataloger at any time.

The statistics and the analysis of the information related to the cataloging process permit quality control and a detailed level accountability related to those engaged in the cataloging process.

Digital Object ingestion is overseen by a validation process integrated into the cataloging workflow. The same process is followed each time for example a user updates information about an object with annotation or citations. During the process of ingestion the DO inherits administrative information such as information regarding the user executing the cataloging as well as the collection and the community to which this DO belongs. This information is cataloged as part of the administrative metadata for the object.

The ingestion process is managed by the workflow framework integrated into the Cataloger component Enhydra Shark Java XPDL workflow ref. 5 .

Each phase of the ingestion process is audited and reported see AUDITING AND STATISTICS FOR OBJECTS AND USERS . Once the DO has been ingested into the repository the use policy related to the object is managed by Cataloger see POLICY MANAGEMENT . Each time a DO has been submitted for ingestion into the repository the DO will undergo an approval process.

Once a DO has been approved for repository submission it is assigned a unique universal identifier URI both Handle and or DOI . This unique universal identifier is requested of the Cataloger by the Handle server utilizing the PID generator of FEDORA.

The user can audit the history of the cataloging process including any updates made to the DO. If the user wished to update information relating to the DO the ingestion module creates a new version of the DO. The administrator can monitor the process of cataloging measuring the time and efficiency of the process in order to improve the workflow. The history of the cataloging of the object is registered directly within administrative metadata of the DO utilizing the schema Digiprov ref. 15 . Digital Object versioning is managed directly in FEDORA and it is accessible to the Cataloger through the API of FEDORA.

The Cataloger offers a metadata sensitive search engine built with the Lucene Solr engine and is packaged with FEDORA. Users can carry out searches with the following filters 

The DO cataloged can be mapped onto one or more Topic Maps TM made available to the Cataloger component. Topic Maps are created with tools external to the Cataloger. Each time a DO is cataloged it is associated with one or more topics used to create the semantic layer of the TM. The TM creation can to some extent be automated utilizing tools such as TM4J MDF and the TMHarvester which can extract semantic data for each DO which can be used to update the existing repository system TM.

In order to enable Topic Maps based collation of Dublin Core information Dublin Core description sets have limited usefulness unless they can be aggregated based on meaning Topic Maps makes such aggregation possible.

The Complex Digital Objects CDO created by the Cataloger are aggregations of simple DOs connected by RDF relationships. The principle DO contains descriptive and administrative metadata where as the metadata created with the various schema are cataloged as separate DOs or children connected to the parent object via the RDF contained in the RELS EXT datastream. At the moment of the submission of the object into FEDORA the Cataloger manages the registration of each part of the aggregate DO into the repository with its relative affiliation.

The construction of Cataloger component permits a flexible object oriented approach to the integration of additional schema into the cataloging workflow. The Cataloger component utilizes the Cocoon ref. 2 framework allowing creation and management of XML documents XML documents are utilized to catalog the schema of the DOs. Additionally Cocoon allows easy transformation of XML objects in the various formats required in the platform HTML XHTML PDF portable document format among others. For example the metadata schema in XML utilized as a template to catalog the schema for the Digital Objects can automatically be transformed by Cocoon in an HTML form utilized by users for cataloging. This permits the creation of a generic method for the transformation of schema metadata in HTML allowing addition of as many schema as needed without necessitating any intervention on the code of the component itself.

XForms ref. 3 along with Cocoon are used to create algorithms of validation for input data. OpenLDAP is used to access the user directory and an implementation of DRAMA XACML is used to integrate with FEDORA. MySQL rel. 12 is being used as a database. Ontology access is made possible with Protege and the Jena framework. For the syntactic validation of input data during the cataloging process the JHOVE framework is used. Object mapping for the creation of Topic Maps is made possible by the TM4J motor and the API TMAPI.

This section describes the 3 principle user types which utilize the Cataloger component of management system.

The Authorization Management Module permits the centralized management of users Cataloger services and management of single Digital Objects in the repository. The Administrator can configure authorization for access to services for users or groups of users. The Administrator can also assign management privileges for community collection and account managers.

Account managers can assign and configure their respective areas for the cataloging of DOs relative the repository areas assigned by the administrator.

The Administrator assigns access privileges to users and groups of users creating areas of publication within the repository which are referred to as communities within which are assigned services such as collections as requested by the users.

The cataloging process of the DO generates a number of Submission Information Package SIP linked together by RDF relations that represents the object to catalog with all information which is sent to the repository for archiving.

Each component of the DO aggregation is treated as a single object child belonging to parent DO object. When this DO is cataloged and ingested into the repository FEDORA it is archived as an aggregate of single linked DOs with RDF triples. This aggregation would be a named map in the ORE model OAI ORE Open Archives Initiative Object Reuse and Exchange . This is DO aggregation is formalized in FEDORA FOXML Fedora Object XML and RDF triples.

The policy and processing decisions regarding DO ingest storage access and preservation are frequently conditioned on a per format basis. In order to achieve necessary operational efficiencies repositories need to be able to automate these procedures to the fullest extent possible.

After choosing the community and the collection to catalog a DO the user chooses the object type of the DO to catalog. We use the standard DC Vocabulary to select the DO type 

Collection An aggregation of resources. A collection is described as a group its parts may also be separately described.

Multimedia files attached to the DO are cataloged into parent object utilizing Fedora Datastreams. These attachments can be of any media type or format. For JPEG formatted images the Cataloger can determine and catalog the technical metadata of the image automatically.

Digilib is utilized as an image server. Digilib is used for instance in the ALCATRAZ framework of image text and annotation tools.

Authorized users will be able to add update and eliminate attachments from cataloged DO or from DO container newly created. It is necessary to submit the new version of parent DO to the work flow ingestion process to approve updates.

This schema represents the standard way of cataloging information about a DO inside it. Schema selections features and functions comprise identify the contexts Point of Views where information needed to be cataloged identify the standardized types of information needed to be cataloged for each context 

When the descriptive metadata are input by users utilizing an extend DC schema they can select from various languages available for the schema 

Administrative metadata is the information necessary to allow the repository to manage the DO this can include information on how the DO was scanned its storage format etc. often called technical metadata copyright and licensing information often called rights metadata and information necessary for the long term preservation of the DO preservation metadata among others.

Technical metadata is data about the DO itself not about the subject of the image . It includes information about the technical processes used in image capture or manipulation and color file formats among others. Some of the technical information that is recorded about the image such as the image file type must be machine readable following specific technical formats in order for a computer system to be able to properly display the image. DIG35 Metadata Standard for Digital Images guidelines are used to model technical metadata.

Preservation metadata is the information necessary to carry out document and evaluate the processes that support the long term retention and accessibility of digital materials.

Annotation metadata contains additional information related to a cataloged resource but separate from the resource. Annotation allows channel end user feed back to enrich metadata. The purpose of metadata enrichment is two fold to improve user access usability and to improve search engine retrieval of cataloged resources SEO search engine optimization . Annotations can take the form of a qualified professional commentary associated with a object created ad hoc for the object. Annotations can also take the form of the creation of associations with objects from other galleries within the ADARTS digital repository or other repositories in the ADARTS federation.

The DLESE Digital Library for Earth System Education Annotation Framework is used for annotation. Digilib software is used to link annotation onto an image.

Regardless of the object being referenced whether print based audiovisual electronic or artwork among others most objects possess common elements from which a reference may be constructed. Among these common elements are author someone or some group that has responsibility for the content of the material a title the name it carries a place of publication its place of origin a publisher the name of the organization or individual that issues the work and a date when the work was published or came to be known . Bibliographic elements are to be listed in a reference.

In constructing a bibliographic reference the creator of the reference decides precisely what material needs to be cited. For example a reference to an entire book would be appropriate on some occasions while a reference to a single chapter would be more appropriate in other cases. A reference to an entire journal article would indicate one type of use for the material while a reference to a table or chart in that article would indicate a different type of usage.

In order to accommodate the specificity required by some references it is frequently necessary to include logically and hierarchically related components or subdivisions of a work. A reference to a journal article which would include an author and a title would still be useless without mention of the title of the journal in which it appears. A reference to a single song on a compact disk that is part of a six disk set would need to include information about the song the disk on which it is recorded and the name of the disk set. A reference to a document that is part of a file stored in a database will likewise require information about three entities the document the file and the database. These logical and hierarchical relationships are known as bibliographic levels.

The descriptive product metadata refer to information which describes products such as standard product categories and information related to the product itself. This information can be useful for future applications such as e commerce. The United Nations Standard Products and Services Code UNSPSC is used for product classification because it provides an open global multi sector standard for efficient accurate classification of products and services. The UNSPSC offers a single global classification system that can be used for company wide visibility of spend analysis cost effective procurement optimization full exploitation of electronic commerce capabilities among others.

This module permits the object to be integrated into an e commerce system. The UNSPSC has been used because it provides an open global multi sector standard for efficient accurate classification of products and services. The UNSPSC offers a single global classification system that can be used for company wide visibility of spend analysis cost effective procurement optimization full exploitation of electronic commerce capabilities among others.

The Administrator can empower users to set access permission to a DO permitting the user to alter the metadata inherited by the DO from the community or collection. Permission can be set at the level of all DOs in a collection or in a community.

A common feature of nearly every repository system is the use of a hierarchy of nested containers for organizing and navigating through content yet associative browsing allows an interested data consumer to wander across a repository in a guided manner. A user entering the repository via a query might also find associative browsing useful in increasing the chance of serendipitous discovery of relevant information giving users a way to completely bypass the structural organization of the data.

To emphasize this less linear approach to resource discovery and navigation both conceptual and physically a parallel navigational system is built using a Topic Map TM . Each time an object is cataloged it is associated with one or more topics used to create the semantic layer of the TM. The TM creation can to some extent be automated utilizing tools such as TM4J MDF and the TM Harvester. These automated tools can extract semantic data for each DO said data can then be used to update the existing repository system TM.

The TM describes the growth of the content brought into the system as an evolution of interrelated dynamic information in a polyhierarchical environment. With each update to the repository the Topic Map of the system is also updated to reflect the new additions creating an expanding dynamic subject index. Advantages of such TMs include an efficient context based retrieval of digital resources and better awareness in subject domain browsing information visualization customized views and adaptive guidance.

The problems of find ability reusability and share ability of a DO in the repository is solved by incorporating a semantic layer based on conceptualization of the DO subject domain. The fundamental idea is to build a repository as both concept based and ontology aware. The implementation of such repository mapping utilizing the ISO XTM standard XML Topic Maps provides a means of organizing and retrieving information from the repositories in an efficient and meaningful way. This module permits the mapping of a DO within a Topic Map accessible from the Cataloger. The management of the Topic Map is external to the Cataloger while the mapping of the DO takes place from within the Cataloger. rel. 18 

The workflow model used for the Cataloger is simple. Digital Objects in the process of being cataloged are saved in a temporary area of the Cataloger called the DO container until the object has been approved for submission into the repository. When an approved DO is modified a copy of the object is saved in the DO container where it undergoes the process of approval. Once approved a new version of the DO is submitted to the repository.

This module is fundamental for cataloging objects within FEDORA. The DOs created by the cataloger are subdivided into parent DOs and their respective children thanks to the adoption of RDF.

The History and Versioning module is linked to the Workflow module and permits a view of the entire history of a DO. Through the history it is possible to reconstruct all previous versions of a DO. Versioning permits the creation of new versions of a DO or to reconstruct previous versions of a DO. The DO object history also permits access to the metadata of the audit history of the DO object which includes the information regarding the author of modifications the date and the part of the DO which was modified. The history also permits an elaboration of the statistics related to cataloging of a DO such as time spent cataloging and the accuracy of the cataloging information.

It is realized with Cocoon pipeline that interfaces Lucene SoIr for getting link to the DO stored in Fedora.

To generate statistics we will utilize the audit data gathered from the Cataloger users operations carried out on a DO and audit data gathered from the search engine.

Referring generally to and the multilayered preservation semantic and Topic Mapped and polyhierarchical representations of DOs created and archived with the PolyCat module can now undergo the process of metadata enrichment in the ADAMS module.

The A Digital Asset Management System ADAMS permits the aggregation of DOs into Complex Digital Objects CDO and Complex Semantic Digital Objects CSDO .

The user has the ability of creating new CDOs by aggregating digital content and their associated metadata from various sources. The purpose of aggregation is to enrich the DO parent with associate information to help expand its description. This method also provides a finding aid for the parent DO. Associated resources children can also contribute to the actual cataloging process by providing descriptions transcriptions and references for a DO parent . Consequently metadata associated with a DO is enriched for subsequent data mining information extraction SPARQL and reasoning Pellet GRDDL with WordNet processes enhancing search engine retrieval.

Another significant advantage of this semantic approach to digital asset management is that these types of DOs can be further interpreted and elaborated on by other semantic savvy applications. For example in the semantic content management described herein SPARQL queries and other techniques are be utilized to dynamically populate web based galleries and magazine containers also referred to here as Smart galleries magazine and albums with content to meet a user s interests.

The RDF framework data model and related technologies enables an optimal representation of semi or not structured data that is with a minimal amount or even without constraints on the structure of the data. The query language SPARQL enables not only the extraction of data from an RDF data source e.g. DO and the value of their attributes but also of metadata information e.g. which properties a DO can be associated with or what domain restriction a property may have . These two complementary capabilities enable both more traditional data retrieval e.g. retrieve all paintings in a museum in Rome from the XVII century and their authors as well as the exploration of the data e.g. return all the properties associated to paintings . SPARQL enables the arbitrary combination of these two querying paradigms.

In RDF SPARQL query answering is the main tool to provide data aggregation. SPARQL enables property based aggregation i.e. the possibility of retrieving collections of DOs and their associated data based on their characteristics like attributes or being instance of a specific class e.g. retrieve all oil paintings in private collections or retrieve all paintings being in the same museum as the paint having the id oid af56938 .

A semantic infrastructure based on RDF lays its foundations on two different layers the data layer and the semantic layer. The first lower layer is represented by the actual RDF graph nodes are data DOs and literals and edges are properties connecting them. The second layer is the actual ontology one or more ontologies that s not relevant which provide the additional semantic information.

Data can be queried at either the two levels on the data layer or through the ontology but the information extracted and the complexity of the query answering task can be dramatically higher when the semantic layer is involved.

To highlight the differences at the data layer we can have information like object o1 is a Painting and object o2 is a WorkOfArt while at the semantic layer we can have information like the fact that any Painting is also a WorkOf Art. Let s consider the same query give me all the objects of the class WorkOfArt if issued at the data layer the answer would be just o2 while if issued by taking into account the semantic layer as well then the answer would contain both o1 and o2.

An interesting property of the data model is that when you add information e.g. considering the semantic layer as well queries provide more results. That is all the results of a query issued just at the data level will be valid results of a query issued by taking into account the semantic lever as well it s the so called property of monotonicity .

Although SPARQL has been mainly designed to query just the data layer it has been used for the combined semantic query answering.

Results from SPARQL queries can be returned either as a serialized RDF graph using the CONSTRUCT operator or a table with variable binding serialized in a pre defined XML format. The table can be processed using standard XML based tools to generate web presentation forms.

As described above in this inventive system a DO undergoes three primary cataloging processes multi layered during the ingestion or submission phase these three DO versions also permit three different aggregation processes referred to here as DO aggregation semantic DO aggregation and resource mapping within the ADAMS Topic Map.

A partial listing of the types of resources that can be aggregated to a parent DO include but not limited to images text bibliographic references video audio web pages web portals and other collections of DOs found in other distributed networks and archives. At this stage of aggregation all DOs selected for possible aggregation are stored with their metadata RDF in the ADAMS semantic repository .

Any digital resource types can be aggregated into a CDO. In a preferred embodiment the ADARTS portal Complex Semantic Digital Objects CSDO are constructed utilizing advertising images parent with associated text based resources including but not limited to product reviews among others children for the creation of what we refer to here as Smart Ads .

The ADAMS aggregator utilizes different strategies and technologies to find and to aggregate the digital resources from various available sources 

ADARTS is a thematic web portal including an integrated web based system structured for the repurposing of collections of print based advertising collections which utilizes a complete value added chain for the creation cataloging enrichment and distribution of these types of digital assets and includes a data base to manage and display historic corporate collections of print based advertising images and other print based product communications such product manuals product reviews product catalogs corporate calendars etc.

Although the thematic topic of the prototype describes specifically the transformation of print advertising into Semantic Digital Marketing Object SDMO the application cataloging system data base digital repository and distribution system can be used to transform any marketing communication into semantic digital marketing objects encompassing but not limited to all aspects of the field of advertising such as external publicity with geospatial tagging video ads and audio jingles web pages with associated metadata cataloging. This would also include the creation of SDMO born as such and not only as the product of a transformation process regarding a physical multimedia asset. Even though the integrated metadata centric system described here is tailored specifically to the repurposing of print advertising archives the application developed and the innovative techniques utilized in this prototype could also be applied to other thematic topics.

This thematic portal and subject gateway dedicated to the history of advertising in print ADARTS described in this document is utilized to explore the Quantistic Marketing Method QMM and provides an opportunity to utilize the metasemantic advertising tools and techniques described in this document as a distribution channel for web based brand advertising. The portal architecture and the data base model created specifically to manage the theme of the ADARTS portal is an integral part of the DO metadata cataloging and attribution process which organically contribute to the creation of the metadata associated with SDO Semantic Digital Object and CDO Complex Digital Object by attributing administrative and collections metadata to each object. This metadata is inherited through each phase of DO processing Authoring Publishing and Delivery.

The system utilizes an open scalable object oriented architecture for the management and publication of digital multimedia assets. The architecture permits both the inclusion of assets from the dedicated ADARTS Digital Repository ADARTS DR or the inclusion of digital assets DO present in trusted federated repositories.

Referring to The Advertising Arts ADARTS portal provides a single web based user interface for a collaborative environment where archive owners can solicit commentary and value added content for their online galleries.

The system can be used for any type of multimedia content and here we describe an application tailored specifically to digital surrogates of print advertising. No system currently exists which provides archives of print based advertising with these innovative services. And to our knowledge no similar system exists for the utilization of metadata associated to advertisement distribution and search engine optimization.

This system provides the semantic tools needed to permit the transformation of print based archives of advertising images into effective web marketing vehicles for the online distribution of brand messages and product information to targeted end user groups. The application includes a set of software based tools to enrich the references associated with each single DO and the aggregation relevant content into CDOs. The DO is further enhanced through a secondary semantic cataloging. The resulting object is referred to here as a Semantic Digital Object SDO . Referring to and a multilevel Metadata Format Filter MEFF can be applied to any CDO at any level of the hierarchy of the CDO to filter relevant metadata to extract references significant to a targeted market sector for publication. The entire enrichment process works to select distill and improve the quality of semantic pointers which refer to any digital original present within the system.

This system provides the semantic tools needed to build a portal structure used to publish CDOs. Portal structure is build by component named Presentation Digital Object PDO . Each PDO component represents a navigation level of the portal and expresses express a default MEFF level filter. Using these tools PDOs are linked together to build the entire portal structure. In this way it is possible to separate content CDOs by layout PDOs .

The system represents a complete value added work chain for transforming collections of advertising materials into Semantic Digital Objects SDO and their enrichment through their association with other DO CDO and SDO integrating systems to create manage enrich and distribute multimedia content. By creating a system for the creation and an effective management of the metadata of these digital assets the digital archives of advertising images through the process defined in and applied in this application become effective web marketing tools for brand communications. The primary tools for web based advertising Metasemantic advertising described here are the Complex Digital Object Creator CDOC the Presentation Digital Object Creator PDOC the Metasemantic Digital Object Creator MSDOC and the Metadata Format Filter MEFF .

During the Authoring phase a Digital Object DO parent can be enriched with external resources i.e. information held in other institutional repositories through a process of aggregation with other associated digital assets DO children . This process of enrichment of a cataloged DO includes the search for and discovery of associated resources their aggregation and the preparation of these aggregations for distribution across a chosen channel. The ADAMS component provides software modules for the creation of these aggregations. They are referred to here as Complex Digital Objects CDO and Complex Semantic Digital Objects CSDO .

The purpose of the creation of aggregations of DO or CDO is to enrich information of the parent DO with associated external resources children . The structure of the CDO is similar to the DO created within the Cataloger component except that the CDO can inherit external resources as well as predetermined aspects of those external resources.

ADAMS can be utilized with a second instance of FEDORA which would be used as a database to archive the surrogate copies of parents and children DO from external repositories as well as the copies and versions of the aggregations or Complex Digital Objects CDO created during the process of digital object enrichment for distribution.

Clients can choose to either maintain their archive within the ADARTS Digital Repository DR or create and manage their own external DR. If ADARTS clients have opted to create their own DR for the preservation of their corporate documents and digital media assets then their DR becomes part of the ADARTS Repository Federation . When a customer s Digital Repository joins ADARTS Federation surrogate copies are imported into the ADAMS for eventual publication on the ADARTS Portal. This open distributed architecture OAI permits a user to participate in the ADARTS portal project and maintain an independently managed corporate DR. It also provides users with the possibility of accessing multiple trusted digital repositories through a single unique gateway ADAMS.

The surrogate DO versions present in ADAMS are periodically checked for cataloging updates of their digital originals that are held in the ADARTS DR.

The surrogates held in ADAMS can be synchronized with the digital original in the repository with the updates from the ADARTS DR or other federated repositories . This is accomplished by a batch processing of the ADARTS system.

The Complex Digital Objects CDO composed of surrogate copies of their associated digital original and their metadata are stored in the ADAMS for publication on site. ADAMS is unique to the ADARTS project and includes a digital repository where the CDO constructed by the Editorial Staff . from the cataloged assets present in the federated digital repositories are stored. These CDO surrogates are stored in the ADAMS for portal publication after final administrative approval.

The editorial work associated with gallery management among others is carried out either by the ADARTS Editorial Staff or by registered collaborators working for ADARTS users account holders responsible for data ingestion on the part of the user. After the digital originals have been registered into the ADARTS DR copies of the digital assets utilized for the construction of the CDO are imported from a DR into the ADAMS.

An architecture permitting the use of multiple instances of FEDORA possibly running on different distributed and federated ref. 17 machines has been chosen to 

ADAMS utilizes an instance of the Lucene SoIr as a search engine for resource discovery. . These searches can take place within federated repositories see aDORe within the repository dedicated to ADAMS as well as other external repositories. It is also possible to integrate additional search functionality utilizing web services such as Google s SOAP Simple Object Access protocol search API.

The Harvester module is based on the OAICAT software Open Archive Initiative Cataloging Open Source Software and permits the retrieval of objects from federated repositories the ADAMS dedicated repository or from other external repositories in the OAI PMH Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting protocol.

Surrogate copies of the digital assets utilized for the construction of the CDO can also be imported into ADAMS from any trusted federated repository where the digital media assets have previously been appropriately cataloged. Consequently ADAMS provides a unique federation interface for asset ingestion when users are also DR Digital Repository owners. The cataloged single digital asset within the DRs are then ready to be enriched through annotations citations or associations with other digital assets present within the Federated repositories as described above .

The Editorial Staff consults the ADARTS DR to select the DO to publish. Once the object has been chosen it is annotated or associated with other relevant content if available or requested by the user. The new CDO is then ready to be published and a surrogate copy is then stored in the ADARTS Portal Management System PMS awaiting final administrative approval and publication on the ADARTS portal.

The original metadata of the DO is stored in the repository where the Object DO was cataloged. Surrogate copies of these DO are then copied into ADAMS where they can be used to create CDO. Finally the surrogate and filtered MEFF version of the CDO or SDO which is published on the ADARTS portal is stored in the data base associated with the PMS of ADARTS which in the actual prototype is a MySQL data base.

A collection of related simple DOs are brought together into a Complex Digital Object CDO by combining selected metadata from each single DO and enveloping them into a single Complex Digital Object. This enrichment of a single DO is accomplished with the help of the Complex Digital Image Creator CDOC see .

The CDOC is an innovative cataloging and construction tool for CDO with extensive editing and publishing features which are unique to the ADARTS project. CDOC and ADAMS have been designed specifically for the digital archive management and online publication needs of advertising image collections however it will be obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art that the technology can be advantageously applied to any DO archive.

Surrogate copies of the CDO and versions as well as surrogate copies of simple DO digital objects published on the ADARTS portal are stored in ADAMS. The digital originals containing their entire heredity of metadata are stored in the ADARTS DR or federated DR. ADAMS can be seen as the publishing repository interfacing directly with the ADARTS portal and the ADARTS DR acts as the long term digital preservation repository.

In the event that a resource external to the system has been selected for aggregation and this resource is without adequate semantic metadata data associated with it the resource is first cataloged within the POLYCAT to provide it with the minimum semantic information semantic handle to permit it to be aggregated and distributed within the system. see 

The semantic representation or semantic surrogate copy of the DO that has been selected for inclusion in the enrichment process and submission into the ADAMS repository is then assigned a new DO identifier URI . The semantic representations of these digital resources are then represented as SPARQL end points for future aggregation. Each DO and CDO held in the repository and submitted to the system has its respective SDO and SCDO version stored in the semantic repositories of the cataloger and ADAMS modules.

Once within the system semantic resource discovery is semi automated through a process resource discovery based upon information extraction utilizing SPARQL queries in conjunction with reasoners such as Pellet and GRDDL Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Languages in conjunction with WordNet. Other similar extraction technologies to create semi automatic semantic representations of text based resources include Text20nto and D2RQ.

In the next phase the user selects the candidate digital assets and their related metadata which have been previously cataloged in the POLYCAT to associate with the parent DO and stored in the RDF triple store of the POLYCAT module.

During the Authoring phase a Semantic Digital Object SDO parent can be enriched with semantic resources through a process of aggregation with other associated digital assets SDO children . This process of enrichment of a cataloged DO includes the search discovery and extraction of associated resources their aggregation into RDF graphs and their preparation for distribution across a chosen channel. The ADAMS component provides software modules for the location extraction and the aggregation of these semantic representations. They are referred to here as Complex Semantic Digital Objects CSDO .

An example of Semantic Digital Object Collections SDOC is a grouping of DOs cataloged utilizing the same POV. SDOC is a semi automated cataloging through inheritance of collections level metadata for each member of the collection. See . 

 Non semantic resources must be firstly cataloged to be annotated semantically with a semantic instance stored in the semantic repository synchronized with the POLYCAT.

The first step in the process of semantic enrichment entails the creation of a surrogate copy of the DO that will be used for the enrichment process and its submission into the ADAMS repository where it is assigned a new DO identifier which will be used as to envelope the CDO which will be enriched. In the next phase the operator selects the candidate digital assets and their related metadata which have been previously cataloged in the POLYCAT to associate with the parent DO. In the event that an resource external to the system has been selected for aggregation and this resource is without adequate semantic metadata data associated with it the resource is first cataloged within the POLYCAT to provide it with the minimum semantic information to permit it to be aggregated and distributed within the system. In the event that it is not desirable or not feasible for instance when it is not permitted by a resource owner to hold a copy of the DO used for aggregation within the ADAMS repository the aggregation process can utilize a semantic surrogate an RDF graph produced through the cataloging process or previously registered URI can be utilized.

Once the CDO object representation has been completed and readied for publication the operator can filter the metadata associated with the CDO for a specific distribution channel utilizing the MEFF application. See . 

The DO after having been cataloged and classified is saved within the systems semantic repository which will be utilized primarily for the semantic management of the DO from this point forward. The DO has already undergone the process of cataloging revision and approval at this point. See . 

CDOs can be retrieved by other search methods by mapping them on to a Topic Map of the archive which represents the ADAMS repository. See . 

ADAMS utilizes a multiple user multiple client architecture providing managed access to multiple local and remote repositories. When this is combined with the exemplary application for managing digital archives of print based advertising ADARTS the overall system embodies a unified digital object registry and repository capable of archiving digital copies of all or any print based advertisements and product related information. The archiving system includes a unique DO registry and semantic mapping of all advertisements entered into the system by company brand and product but not anyway limited to these three. This permits the interrogation and multi faceted search strategies made available through the search interface of the ADARTS portal.

The MEFF Module or MEFF ensures that the most effective and appropriate representation of the DO and its associate metadata are chosen for a distribution channel or specific distribution. Prior to publication of the CDO aggregate metadata attached to the CDO goes through an editing process. The CDO and SDO can be represented by all or by a part of the metadata which it inherits as a parent from the Cataloger or from the aggregated resources children . This qualitative approach to DO representation includes a flexible and tailor made disseminator which can be used to avoid the distribution of useless information for a given channel while maintaining the advantages of the lineage offered by the parent child relationship. The MEFF Module can also act as a Metadata Management System MMS .

While the creation of CDOs offers the advantages of providing an unlimited number of annotations and associated content in one encapsulated object by its very nature it also presents the risk of providing too much information to the viewer. To this end a metadata format filter MEFF component has been developed which functions by selecting editing and distributing the metadata best suited to summarize the CDO and it contents for any given distribution channel. An overview of the process CDO creation metadata filtering and publication is described here.

The system described permits the processing of CDOs for publication by permitting the administrator to regulate the type of metadata which can be published for any given DO. Factors which could determine the metadata published for any given distribution channel could depend for instance on a client s requests or defined by a marketing specified need. The metadata utilized to represent a CDO during publication can be analyzed for visitor search behavior within the portal. In this way the type of metadata published in a given distribution for example the ADARTS portal can be modified and better tailored to optimize access for a targeted user groups. This analysis can also be utilized for the modification of the structure of the CDO itself for example by adding additional associated DO to the CDO best suited to the interests of a target market. The metadata selected for publication will be exported to external channels such as harvester or web utilizing the Metadata Format Filter MEFF of the ADARTS content management system . See . 

The Metadata Format Filter can also be utilized to manage the publication of the content DO of the CDO and SDO in the chosen distribution channel. While filtering this metadata we can also sort the content that the metadata belongs to dynamically populating galleries and magazine with content and the metadata relating to these objects using the MEFF filter and the appropriate templates MSDO and PDO . This is used to publish content instances into specific web pages galleries or magazines while at the same time selecting the metadata which will be published along with the DO in various parts of the page for example in the header of the HTML document.

This software component which has been designed developed and applied to the selected theme of the exemplary distribution channel ADARTS permits the administrator extensive management and control of the metadata published within any chosen distribution channel. The management function enables the administrator to regulate the type of metadata which will be published for a given DO in a given distribution channel depending on the client s requests and marketing specified needs ex. SEO for target markets .

The metadata output can be tailored to optimize search engine requests and therefore access by target user groups. The administrator can regulate the metadata filters and authorize editorial staff to selectively edit and publish the metadata associated with a CDO based on various criteria. The metadata selected for publication can be exported to external channels such as web harvester or messaging utilizing the Metadata Format Filter MEFF . The MEFF mechanism permits the administrator the possibility of selecting the types of metadata which will be visualized for all the services associated with a given ADARTS customer such as a client s Gallery or Magazine. This will be the default profile metadata of the customer that could be customized by the customer itself on single service. The MEFF mechanism gives the administrator the ability of selecting the types of metadata which will be visualized for a DO during distribution. Consequently the administer has the ability to regulate the ways in which the DO will be viewed and accessed by the visitor and by search engines.

The advantages of this approach for the management of DOs includes the ability to dynamically optimize for search engine placement of DOs galleries or product categories within the ADARTS portal. The administrator can also provide tailored services to targeted user groups with focused semantic handles to specified assets.

The particular application of the MEFF component described here was designed to meet the requirements of the exemplary distribution channel the ADARTS portal. A portal can be considered as a CDO with its architecture designed around this concept the metadata format filters MEFF can be applied from the highest level to the last node of the portal structure of the DO taking advantage of the principles of inheritance and overloading. The portal can also manage filter and publish metadata of the CDO on the chosen distribution channel the filter can also be utilized to publish aggregated content. For instance a POV sub level MEFF of a portal channel MEFF permits the faceted browsing of the CDO and SDO instances as cataloged in the POLYCAT.

In the exemplary embodiment the ADARTS portal the filter MEFF can be used to provide a stratified management of the metadata publication process allowing for differentiated metadata publication for different types of portal pages Home Product and individual Gallery Pages on a system wide level.

As we move down the portal hierarchy from general to more specific categories the metadata published also can grow into greater detailed metadata. Utilizing the Summary and Detailed aspects of each MEFF filter the system can also be used to manage the representation of portal content.

In object oriented programming inheritance refers to the principle through which a class is defined as a child of another and inherits all of its properties and methods. Utilizing this principle of inheritance the metadata format filter MEFF of the parent if present is inherited by the DO children.

In object oriented programming overloading refers to the principle through which a class child can redefine that is while using a method of the same name number and argument type the class of the parent. In this case the parent filter will be overloaded and the child filter selected will be applied to the DO. Utilizing this method of overloading it is possible to personalize the application of any filter at any level for any child DO.

In the case of ADARTS the portal structure is not designed and utilized as a single Complex Digital Object but as a hierarchical structure of interconnected CDO. Each CDO is first collected by association with a topical context.

The first level of topical context is represented by the distribution channel itself . in the exemplary case described the ADARTS portal and its home page. The second level of topical context is represented by the product category which describes each CDO advertisement as pertaining to a specific category of product automobile jewel watches cosmetics etc. . The third level is the customer User Level MEFF . Each customer has own metadata profile.

The fourth is represented by two topic contexts the gallery and the magazine object types. On the fifth level as a sub context to the gallery DO there is the gallery item and as a sub context to the magazine the issue. The sixth level is the article which is a sub context of the issue. Follows is a description of the structure of the MEFF based on its context.

If a filter has not been set metadata will be published toward the chosen distribution channel in its entirety. The following example uses the MEFF filter developed for the ADARTS portal. See . 

The MEFF user level filter permits the administrator to define a generic filter for a given customer and his services. The MEFF user level filter permits the administrator to define a generic filter for all services of a given customer gallery gallery item magazine etc . This filter is then applied to all of the DOs being published toward the chosen customer that is unless a filter with a greater value has been defined for use.

Each filter has a set priority regarding its application in regards to the output of its associated metadata 

The metadata filtered for the Summary View includes the essential metadata of parent and children needed to accurately represent the CDO or DO . In the case of a distribution towards the ADARTS portal this representation of the CDO is published by means of the Meta Elements placed at the head of the XHTML document.

The Detailed View provides a more extended view of the metadata available for the CDO. The Detailed View of the metadata is published in a page dedicated to an exploded view of the CDO. This page is accessed through the page containing the Summary View through a More info link. The Detailed View of the metadata is published both in the Meta Elements at the head and in the body of the XHTML document.

The Channel Level MEFF permits the administrator to define a generic filter for the entire channel. This filter is applied to all of the DOs published on the channel. See . 

The Category Level MEFF permits the administrator to define a filter for a category 1 or n . This filter can be applied to all of the DOs in the category or categories selected unless a filter with a greater value has not been defined for use. For example if a category level MEFF is defined for title metadata and identification ID metadata the category level MEFF will filter metadata and only permit publication of these two types of metadata i.e. title and ID for the categories selected.

If a gallery level MEFF filter has been created for a client s gallery for example Gucci has been set to publish metadata for title ID and author these take priority over the category level MEFF set for this category to publish only title and id. metadata .

The User Level MEFF permits the administrator to define a generic filter for all of the services associated with a customer. This filter will then be applied to all of the DOs owned by the customer unless a filter with a greater value has not been defined for use See .

The Gallery Level MEFF permits the administrator to define a filter for a particular gallery 1 or n . This filter be applied to all of the DOs in that gallery that is unless for example a MEFF gallery item level priority 5 has been set for a given gallery item permitting the publication of additional metadata as selected by the administrator or editorial staff See .

The Gallery item Level MEFF permits the administrator to define a filter for a particular gallery item 1 to 1 . This filter takes precedents over any other filter utilized . with a lower priority.

The Magazine Level MEFF permits the administrator to define a filter for a magazine 1 or n . This filter will then be applied to all of the DOs in that magazine that is unless for example a MEFF issue level priority 5 has been set for a given issue permitting the publication of additional metadata as selected by the administrator or editorial staff.

The Issue Level MEFF permits the administrator to define a filter for a particular issue 1 or n . This filter will then be applied to all of the DOs in that issue that is unless for example a MEFF issue level priority 6 has been set for a given article permitting the publication of additional metadata as selected by the administrator or editorial staff.

The Article Level MEFF permits the administrator to define a filter for a particular article 1 to 1 . This filter takes precedents over any other filter utilized with a lower priority.

The Presentation Digital Object Creator PDOC permits the creation of template containers and defines templates of web pages as DO types in their own right with the characteristics of any other type of DO. This implies the need for processing or cataloging each template by assigning it relevant metadata. These DOs are referred to in this document as Presentation Digital Objects PDO . See . 

This system works as a PMS portal management system by permitting the Administrator to create the hierarchy of the portal structure by concatenating the single PDO into complex objects CPDO .

Each PDO acts as a container for digital objects of the portal meaning that each PDO represents a web page containing content as a CDO. The administrator can define a default MEFF filter associated with the PDO by selecting metadata schema to be filtered. For example if an administrator creates a PDO for the ADARTS Home Page he could define a default MEFF channel filter for the web channel.

The Administrator can create PDOs with associated MEFF filters where the CDO will be filtered and published. These filters can be customized by CDO filters if present.

The administrator catalogs PDOs into ADAMS and defines a default MEFF level filter. Then he defines the portal structure by creating Complex PDO CPDO which represents the complete structure of ADARTS portal. The administrator provides final approval of template published toward any channel chosen.

The administrator can regulate the publication of updates to predefined time periods to avoid a continual and unsystematic update of portal content ex. nocturnal updates to mailing lists . The content is made available to end users through the delivery channel selected.

After the application of the appropriate metadata format filter s the publishing module permits the content CDO delivery toward the chosen PDO. Within the publishing module interface the Metasemantic Digital Object Creator MSDOC the metadata filtered for the CDO can be examined. This includes the possibility of examining the metadata associated with each single DO the annotations associated with each DO information regarding the collection to which a DO belongs licensing information etc. before final publication.

The MSDOC selects the appropriate PDO for publication on that channel. The MSDOC permits the publication of the metadata filtered MEFF for the CDO through a PDO container.

Final result will be a new DO containing semantic filtered information MSDO shown on the channel in Summary and Detailed view. In case of web channel the result object will be a web page expressed in XHTML standard.

The administrator provides final approval of MSDO published toward any channel chosen. The administrator can regulate the publication of updates to predefined time periods to avoid a continual and unsystematic update of portal content ex. nocturnal updates to mailing lists . The content is made available to end users through the delivery channel selected.

As described above through the use of the various levels of metadata format filters the administrator is provided with a wide range of tools to manage the representation expression and publication of metadata for SDO and CDO throughout the entire portal. By utilizing the Detail View of any given metadata format filter the MEFF component also permits the publication of MSDO content within the body of an XHTML documents.

Through this system of metadata filters it is possible for the administrator and editorial staff to manage the output of metadata and content from the most complex DO to the simplest single DO published on the portal ADARTS.

Let s take as an example an ADARTS magazine with its associated issues articles and galleries. Firstly the magazine may be appropriately structured as a CDO. This will then permit the application of the Magazine Issue and Article level MEFF as well as the Summary and Detail View function of the metadata format filter. With these key elements in place we can then utilize the MEFF component as a metadata centric content management system to manage the publication of the ADARTS magazine metadata and content. Then Administrator associate magazine CDO to magazine PDO for creating Magazine MSDO.

An overview of the structure of the metadata associated with an ADARTS Magazine would detail the metadata of the Magazine level including a Summary View of the associated issue and articles with a more extended description of each article placed in the body of the Magazine Cover Page via the Detailed View.

A magazine is composed of an issue containing a cover which acts as the home page of the magazine issue articles and if available associated galleries. The metadata of the Summary View for a magazine will be published in the Meta Elements of the head of the cover XHTML document together with the metadata of the Summary View of each of the children DOs for example the magazine articles. This will include a summary of the metadata resources for the magazine and children such as the title of the article the author s name and a short description of the article s contents. The application of the Detailed View of the magazine s MEFF will expand upon the short description from the Summary View by making available the entire magazine publication with articles and any associated Galleries within the MSDO in XHTML format ADARTS magazine along with greater details of the other metadata described in the Summary View. The formatting and publication of the magazine in ADARTS takes place using XSLT Transformations invoked by ADARTS PMS to produce a representation of the MSDO in XHTML.

In this case the metadata of the Summary View for each article will be published in the Meta Elements on the head of the XHTML document. This will include a summary of the metadata resources for an article such as the title of the article the author s name and a short description of the article s contents. The application of the Detailed View of the article s MEFF will expand upon the short description from the Summary View by making available the entire article publication within the body of the XHTML document ADARTS magazine article along with greater details of the other metadata described in the Summary View.

The formatting and publication of the article in A DARTS takes place using XSLT to produce a representation of the object in XHTML.

Through this system of metadata filters it is possible for the administrator and editorial staff to manage the output of metadata and content from the most complex DO to the simplest single DO published on the ADARTS Portal.

The Publisher is a component of the software which manages and optimizes the publication of the cataloged and aggregated Digital Objects CDO and SDO toward the chosen distribution channel. The Publisher also manages the interpretation of the CDO and SDO and its encapsulation in the Metasemantic Digital Object MSDO . The interpretation is published on the chosen channel in the presentation templates Presentation Digital Object or PDO appropriate for the publication of the objects within the chosen distribution channel and instance. The metadata format filter MEFF can be considered as essential to both the ADAMS as well as the Publisher component in that the filters are modeled to mirror the architectural hierarchy of the chosen distribution channel. See . 

The Publisher describes a number of semantically savvy applications built to interpret the CDO SDO and a semantic marketing object created in the previous two phases authoring and enrichment and enables their publication.

These applications utilize a semantic content management system consisting of meta semantic digital objects MSDO and Publication or Presentation Digital Object PDO modules. These software modules are used to create smart web based publication templates for the publication of CDO SDO and the smart ads previously described and include systems for the creation and management of a smart gallery smart multi gallery smart magazine and smart visitor s album .

After the selection of the DO from ADAMS and its preparation for publication including the selection and filtering of the metadata deemed appropriate for publication chosen from all of the metadata cataloged and collected during the process of enrichment the DO is ready to be imported into the Publisher s cache for publication.

The DOs surrogates for instance low resolution copies of images preserved in the repository are imported into the Publisher cache component MySQL to speed content delivery from the portal to the channel instance end user and relieve ADAMS and the preservation repository of the burden of content transformation and extraction on the fly.

During the Publication Phase the digital assets which have been readied for publication and distribution are interpreted by the publication component for each specific distribution channel. In most cases this entails the publication of previously cataloged and aggregated DOs on the dynamic semantic web portal ADARTS.

A template is used to interpret the CDO and represent it as a web page. We refer to this template as a PDO Publication or Presentation Digital Object . The Publication component permits content CDO and SDO delivery toward the chosen PDO Publication Digital Object template after the application of the appropriate disseminators MEFF . The CDO is interpreted and disassembled for final publication in a single XHTML template.

The final publication DO created through the association of the CDO or SDO with the PDO is called a Meta Semantic Digital Object MSDO . This component interprets the DO CDO disassembling it into its constituent parts for collocation in a preconfigured template for a web based presentation. The MSDO can be monitored by the Publication component for auditing purposes. The MSDO thanks to the publication of its enriched metadata permits an improved search engine indexing for the parent and children of the aggregated DO.

This module creates Presentation Digital Objects PDO templates for web based distribution. The PDO template consists of 2 types of publication areas. The first area is where the parent DO will be published. The second area consists of one or more secondary areas in which child DOs will be displayed for instance as links to the child resources in the alternative the child is published in its entirety.

The ADAMS repository is interrogated for linked children DO for publication. Linked objects can also be expressed as web links to the DO itself and the metadata pertaining to the DO is expressed in XHTML within the header of the web page when the DO is published.

This module manages the PDO templates list search add modify and delete and are assigned to the CDO for publishing.

The Publication component permits content CDO and SDO delivery toward the chosen PDO template Publication Digital Object after the application of the appropriate disseminators MEFF . The CDO is interpreted and disassembled for representation as a MSDO by a PDO template. This module regulates the process of dissemination of metadata for channel publication.

This module manages MSDO objects including such functions as list search add modify and delete created by the association of PDO templates to CDO and their publication on the web.

The administrator can regulate the publication of updates to predefined time periods to avoid a continual and unsystematic update of portal content ex. nocturnal updates to mailing lists . The content is made available to end users through the delivery channel selected.

The publishing module delivers the content CDO toward the chosen PDO after the application of the appropriate metadata format filter s. Within the publishing module interface the Metasemantic Digital Object Creator MSDOC the metadata filtered for the CDO can be examined. This includes the possibility of examining the metadata associated with each single digital object the annotations associated with each object information regarding the collection to which an object belongs and or licensing information among others before final publication.

Final result will be a new DO containing semantic filtered information MSDO show on the channel in Summary and Detailed view. In case of web channel the result DO will be a web page expressed in XHTML standard.

The administrator provides final approval of MSDO published toward any channel. The administrator can regulate the publication of updates to predefined time periods to avoid a continual and unsystematic update of portal content ex. nocturnal updates to mailing lists . The content is made available to end users through the delivery channel selected.

As described above through the use of the various levels of metadata format filters the administrator is provided with a wide range of tools to manage the representation expression and publication of metadata for SDO and CDO throughout the entire portal. By utilizing the Detail View of any given metadata format filter the MEFF component also permits the publication of MSDO content within the body of an XHTML documents. 60 

Through this system of metadata filters it is possible for the administrator and editorial staff to manage the output of metadata and content from the most complex DO to the simplest single DO published on the portal ADARTS.

Consider as an example an ADARTS magazine with its associated issues articles and galleries. Firstly the magazine may be appropriately structured as a CDO. This allows the application of the Magazine Issue and Article level MEFF as well as the Summary and Detail View function of the metadata format filter. With these key elements in place the MEFF component is utilized as a metadata centric content management system to manage the publication of the ADARTS magazine metadata and content. Then the Administrator can associate magazine CDO to magazine PDO for creating Magazine MSDO.

A magazine is composed of an issue containing a cover which acts as the home page of the magazine issue articles and if available associated galleries. The metadata of the Summary View for a magazine will be published in the Meta Elements of the head of the cover XHTML document together with the metadata of the Summary View of each of the children DOs for example the magazine articles. This will include a summary of the metadata resources for the magazine and children such as the title of the article the author s name and a short description of the article s contents. The application of the Detailed View of the magazine s MEFF will expand upon the short description from the Summary View by making available the entire magazine publication with articles and any associated Galleries within the MSDO in XHTML format ADARTS magazine along with greater details of the other metadata described in the Summary View. The formatting and publication of the magazine in ADARTS takes place using XSLT Transformations invoked by ADARTS PMS to produce a representation of the MSDO in XHTML. 61 

In this case the metadata of the Summary View for each article will be published in the Meta Elements of the head of the XHTML document. This will include a summary of the metadata resources for an article such as the title of the article the author s name and a short description of the article s contents. The application of the Detailed View of the article s MEFF will expand upon the short description from the Summary View by making available the entire article publication within the body of the XHTML document ADARTS magazine article along with greater details of the other metadata described in the Summary View.

The formatting and publication of the article in ADARTS takes place using XSLT to produce a representation of the DO in XHTML.

Through this system of metadata filters it is possible for the administrator and editorial staff to manage the output of metadata and content from the most complex DO to the simplest single DO published on the ADARTS Portal.

It is neither desirable or prudent or obligatory to adopt only one approach to create semantic Digital Objects DO . This application has discussed three methods to create semantic DOs. Adopting multiple approaches to prepare digital assets for at least the three different application and tools sets discussed in this application their related retrieval systems and distribution channels produces an end result where the sum is greater than the part offering services and capacities that no single system offers.

This method and system fills a need in the market place that currently is not being met. Content owners faced with the enormous task of digitizing and cataloging their digital assets want to be sure that their assets are ready for the semantic market. The semantic market is a market place currently under construction. Core semantic technologies such as ontologies extraction and reasoning tools are evolving. The polyhierarchical system described in this invention which combines three different approaches into one cataloging system offers the richest possible representation of a DO for present technologies as well as future semantic applications.

Although the system described can be used to create complex semantic representations of any type of object the exemplary applications detailed herein explains the usefulness of such a system by example demonstrates a working system in use conceived and designed specifically to meet the needs of a semantic marketing method.

This section describes an application of the system described herein. However persons of ordinary skill in the art will realize that the system described herein can be used for other application. The application discussed is for the creation enrichment and distribution of a specific type of DO referred to here as a Smart Ad or semantically intelligent polyhierarchical digital marketing object. The Smart Ad is a Semantic Digital Marketing Object SDMO created as a digital semantic surrogate of a print based advertisement. Other examples of SDMO would be for example any type of print based or electronic marketing communication such as such as web sites web portals web search results pages product catalog ecommerce system audio visual brand communication such as television advertisements bill boards or any other born digital marketing object among others.

The potential market for semantic ads organically optimized for search engine retrieval is a larger market than convention print advertising because of the significant shift from print based ad spending and toward web based ad spending.

The Semantic Digital Objects SDO are utilized in the following section Publishing which describes other exemplary semantically savvy applications and novel utilizations of the inventive system that have been built to interpret these Semantic Marketing Digital Objects SMDO enabling their publication and their utilization for market research. These applications utilize a semantic content management system consisting of meta semantic digital objects MSDO and the Publication or Presentation Digital Object PDO modules. In the novel application described these components are used to create smart web based publication of the smart ads described in the first part of this section and include systems for the creation and management of a smart gallery smart multi gallery smart magazine and smart visitor s album .

This semantic marketing method includes 2 techniques for semantic marketing adapted and embodied by the exemplary application of the inventive system for creating enriching and publishing Semantic Digital Objects the first is referred to here as Semantic and Metasemantic Advertising the second is referred to as Quantistic Marketing.

Semantic Advertising SA and Metasemantic Advertising MSA Metadata Enrichment For Search Engine Optimization.

The first method details a utilization of the inventive system to create manage enrich and distribute the metadata representing a DO in order to improve and organically optimize it for search engine retrieval. This is referred to Semantic Advertising SA .

Smart Ads as other Semantic Digital Objects SDO are linked semantically to other semantically significant content. As the semantic network of these relationships grows well defined referenced digital assets become the cardinal points for the associated description of other DO. Polyhierarchical defined Semantic Digital Objects SDO offer an optimized semantic positioning in a semantic network. One consequences of this is that the first well defined Semantic Digital Objects SDO available on line become part of the semantic mapping of the web itself. This equates to more visibility which equates to a greater distribution of an ad its message the branding and the communications relating to the product now and in the future.

Quantistic Marketing is an innovative approach to web marketing loosely based on Permission Marketing. Permission Marketing claims that current advertising techniques are developed around the idea of disturbing or interrupting a viewer s attention to sell the viewer a product. In contrast to this approach the theory QMM is that it is better to ask someone a viewer s permission before initiating a communication. The end result is a better quality communication with a potential client with the possibility of establishing a longer relationship. This marketing method offers potential clients different information enriched perspectives of a standard corporate brand communication by linking it with cultural historical and artistic information describing or associated to the advertisement to stimulate an active interest on the part of potential clients.

This semantic approach to marketing as called Quantistic Marketing Method because the end user now has a navigational structure which can be modified by the end user s search patterns permitting him to find a DO from many POVs depending on his varied interests. By offering potential clients the possibility of navigating among the many different possible ways of considering a product a brand or a company which have been collected during the cataloging of the various Points of View POV related to product the varied interests of end users can be met more effectively with detailed personalized and interactive communications of a product a brand a company and its related advertisements.

Information regarding a product how its made the designed by who when the history of the brand the product ad design ad strategy ad production process the biography of the model in that ad the biography of the photographer etc. are just a few examples of the types of information which may be of interest to a potential client. Each end user can create his own semantic ad by navigating between the POVs or different types of information which is personally appealing to the potential client.

As the world of commerce enters the semantic market place to make polyhierarchical multilayered product and brand information available to the enriches the end user experience by gratifying curiosity and their attention with information of interest to them which is some way associated to the brand owner.

The Smart Ad described is a specific type of Semantic Digital Object SDO created utilizing a specific adaptation of the inventive system to meet the requirements of an inventive semantic marketing method. This Smart Ad is then processed aggregated enriched and prepared for distribution within the system described in the invention. This object is then distributed through an exemplary web based search and discovery channel which is capable of interpreting the Semantic Digital Object SDO and distributing it.

The Semantic Digital Marketing Object SDMO construction follows the same three layer semantic description process as described during the Cataloging process.

The analog print based advertisement now has three semantic representations. Each of these three representations can be utilized in different processes in different ways for example for enrichment search retrieval and distribution. Each of these three semantic representations also creates a type of semantic handle which can be utilized by different applications in different systems and in different ways alone or in combination.

A prototype has been developed to demonstrate this concept of web marketing each piece of relevant semantic information descriptive metadata associated to a digital surrogate of a print ad SDO represents a conceptual pointer linking to the SDO. Each pointer represents a distribution channel through which the SDO ad can be indexed by a search engine. Any DO can be described semantically from different points of view. For instance an ad can be described as 

This is not intended to any way to represent a complete list of possible POVs or in any way limit the possible ways that the system could describe this type of DO.

Each Point of View POV can be described semantically utilizing a standardized Dublin Core MODS metadata schema and catalogued in a digital repository. As noted above each part of the semantic descriptions catalogued for this DO creates a pointer to the original DO ad . And each point of view enriches the DO with information which may be of interest to potential clients or past customers of the brand advertisement which is the subject of this prototype which is an exemplary embodiment of the system and marketing method described in the invention.

A Smart Ad is a multilevel polyhierarchical Semantic Digital Marketing Object. In the particular prototyped application we have chosen to valorize a collection of print based advertisement comprising various brands different product types or different companies pertaining to different epics that have been cataloged with multilevel descriptions of associated information such as but not limited by or constrained to 

Semantic advertising SA is an innovative marketing system to create for the organic optimization of search engine indexing SEO and a end user navigational method QMM ready for retrieval by the next wave of semantic applications MSA semantic search engines being one example.

The method for creating the object includes a deconstruction of the advertising communication in collaboration with the client into polyhierarchical descriptions or POVs. POV can also be defined on a macro level by the three ways we have chosen to catalog CDO semantic digital object SDO Topic Map TM .

The semantic marketing objects or Smart Ads created are interpreted and processed by the other two generic types of semantic application systems ADAMS and MEFF. That is authoring and aggregating in ADAMS and distribution MEFF. The semantic watermark URI is registered on the ADAMS Topic Map and semantic repository.

Two other specific applications utilizing these Semantic Marketing Objects include the ADARTS portal and portal management system and the content management system used to create and manage on line Magazine.

ADAMS utilizes a multiple user multiple clients architecture providing managed access to multiple local and remote repositories. When this is combined with the exemplary application for managing digital archives of print based advertising ADARTS the overall system embodies a unified DO registry and repository capable of archiving digital copies of print based advertisements and product related information. The archiving system includes a unique DO registry and semantic mapping of all advertisements entered into the system by company brand and product but not anyway limited to these three. The system permits the interrogation and multi faceted search interface of the ADARTS portal which represents a subject gateway for multi taxonomy cross referencing of all product categories. In this way the system permits a statistic analysis of user interactions with the archive and portal system for all brands and all brand categories without violating a user s privacy. This extends to an analysis of the semantic relationships between the DO being statistically examined for example to see whether there is any other more hidden similarities between the ontological instances of the semantic representations of the different DO being viewed by visitors. This is a logical consequence of providing more detailed polyhierarchical cataloging of the DO permitting a more detailed analysis of what is actually motivating interest and search activity. In this way user navigation statistic provides the system with the feed back needed for improving semantic DO representation associated content aggregation and the optimization of the filtering of the metadata MEFF related to the SDO.

Visitor traffic and behavior is registered and analyzed with the scope of optimizing archive accessibility. Particular attention is dedicated to the relationship between user logs of the CDOs retrieved by particular user groups. With the scope of improving targeted user group access to particular archive content the composition of the CDO is analyzed by the marketing team see .

In ADARTS the metadata for a CDO can modified edited and published principally in two ways by either modifying the metadata filter of the CDO or by editing the individual components which make of the CDO. For example regarding the second case as the CDO is made up of the primary object and the metadata of digital objects associated to it the behavior of the CDO can be modified through this association. The ADARTS concept of Quantistic Marketing relates precisely to the managing the search optimization of a digital objects through the construction of CDO composed of relevant related content.

The metadata associated with the objects and the way in which the CDO complex digital objects are sought and retrieved from the portal by particular user groups is analyzed by the marketing analyst. The marketing analysts then refer their findings and requests to the Editorial Staff. The editors work to improve search engine optimization and improve target group accessibility through a process of metadata editing MEFF and republishing associated metadata for these CDOs. Visitor behavior is then reanalyzed for clues to their primary interest and how this is reflected in the metadata retrieved.

The Authoring component is dynamic built to permit the addition of metadata associated with any given DO over time. The more appropriate and relevant the metadata associated with a DO is the more the objects become accessible to the searches of the targeted user group. To enrich information of the object cataloged DO into repository the Authoring component provide a tool for creation of aggregation of DOs named complex digital object CDO .

The Publication component represents the last phase in the value chain for the creation of information enriched DOs. This component prepares digital content objects DO cataloged in the repository for final distribution towards a chosen channel. The Administrator is provided with a wide range of tools to manage the representation expression and publication of the metadata representing DOs as well as the presentation of the DOs themselves.

In this phase the CDO complex digital object undergoes a process of selective dissemination determined in part by the requirements of the distribution channel and in part by considerations for guaranteeing an optimal representation of the CDO for a given channel. The metadata of the CDO can be examined in the Meta Semantic Digital Object Creator or MSDOC. This module permits the examination of the metadata associated with each part of a CDO parent and children the annotations associated with each object information regarding the collection to which an object belongs and licensing information before final publication. The MSDOC permits selection of the appropriate PDO template Presentation Digital Object for channel publication as well as providing information regarding the particular disseminator for the CDO through a PDO container.

The resulting object containing a dissemination of selected semantic information is referred to as a Meta Semantic Digital Object MSDO . In the case of a web channel the object MSDO will be a web page expressed in XHTML standard.

A harvester is a client application that issues OAI PMH requests. A harvester is operated by a service provider as a means of collecting metadata from repositories.

Harvesters working on behalf of service providers collect DIDL documents from the aDORe environment and build services with the contained Digital Objects. As a result identifiers contained in the harvested DIDL documents become available in applications such as search engines.

The OAI Protocol for Metadata Harvesting 14 is a standard for sharing metadata across repositories. Client side applications with flexible configurable interfaces depend on the repository to provide very standardized views of the assets. Each object contains metadata that is specific to it. Metadata about relationships among the assets is assumed to be located in external databases keyed to the repository by the persistent identifier of the object. Metadata about the assets is extracted for the objects and combined with data from external databases to feed the appropriate data to each application. This makes it possible for one digital asset management system to support multiple applications with differing demands.

The OAI PMH is a well established harvesting technology within the digital library community and allows aggregation of metadata from compliant repositories using a date stamp based harvesting strategy. A harvest interface allows collecting or harvesting of surrogates of digital objects. In addition to the facility to harvest all the surrogates exposed by a repository we believe it is necessary to provide a facility allowing some forms of selective harvesting. The simplest and perhaps most useful form of selective harvesting is to allow downstream applications to harvest surrogates only for those digital objects that were created or modified after a given date. This echoes the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting OAIPMH 34 with the same motivation downstream applications may need an up to date copy of all the surrogates from a repository in order to provide some service and incrementally harvesting surrogates of newly added or modified digital objects is an efficient way to do this. A harvest interface could be implemented using various technologies such as the OAI PMH RSS or Atom or with a subset of more complex technologies such as SRU SRW. The OAI PMH is a well established harvesting technology within the digital library community and allows aggregation of metadata from compliant repositories using a date stamp based harvesting strategy. Although the OAI PMH was first conceived for metadata harvesting it can be used to transfer any metadata or data format including complex object formats expressed in XML according to an XML Schema 17 . The OAI PMH is thus capable of providing the harvest functionality and the ability to leverage existing OAI PMH implementations is a significant benefit. To support the harvest interface the underlying OAIPMH interface may follow these conventions 

A repository is a network accessible server that can process the OAI PMH requests in the manner described in this document. A repository is managed by a data provider to expose metadata to harvesters. To allow various repository configurations the OAI PMH distinguishes between three distinct entities related to the metadata made accessible by the OAI PMH.

A resource is the object or stuff that metadata is about . The nature of a resource whether it is physical or digital or whether it is stored in the repository or is a constituent of another database is outside the scope of the OAI PMH.

An item is a constituent of a repository from which metadata about a resource can be disseminated. That metadata may be disseminated on the fly from the associated resource cross walked from some canonical form actually stored in the repository etc.

A record is metadata in a specific metadata format. A record is returned as an XML encoded byte stream in response to a protocol request to disseminate a specific metadata format from a constituent item.

We use the term digital object here in a technical sense to be defined precisely below. Files databases and so forth that one may ordinarily think of as objects with a digital existence are not digital objects in the sense used here at least not until they are made into an appropriate data structure.

System works as follows An originator i.e. a user with digital material to be made available in the System makes the material into a digital object. A digital object is a data structure whose principal components are digital material or data plus a unique identifier for this material called a handle and perhaps other material . To get a handle the user requests one from an authorized handle generator. A user may then deposit the digital object in one or more repositories from which it may be made available to others subject of course to the particular item s terms and conditions etc. . Upon depositing a digital object in a repository its handle and the repository name or IP address is registered with a globally available system of handle servers.

Users may subsequently present a handle to a handle server to learn the network names or addresses of repositories in which the corresponding digital object is stored.

In the manner of the seminal Kahn and Wilensky paper 31 we use the notion of a digital object to describe compositions of digital information. This is purposely abstract and is not tied to any implementation or data model. The principal aspects of a digital object are digital data and key metadata. Digital data can be any combination and quantity of individual data streams or physical streams of bits and can includes nested digital objects. Key metadata at a minimum includes an identifier that is a key for service requests on the digital object at a service point.

one can create subtypes of digital objects by introducing new fields of metadata these may be arranged hierarchically. For example one might create a subtype of digital object called computer science technical report which has metadata for author institution series and so forth. We shall informally refer to digital objects whose data is a set one of whose elements is of type digital object as composite digital objects. A digital object that is not composite is said to be elemental. Note that this definition explicitly excludes the application of the adjective composite to a digital object whose data is another digital object i.e. whose data is of type digital object as distinguished from a singleton set of this type. Nothing precludes the existence of such objects however. 

The terms and conditions of a composite object may implicitly or explicitly be unioned with those of its constituent objects to arrive at the terms and conditions for those constituent objects. Terms and conditions may be explicitly imposed only on the composite object in which case they would apply to each constituent object or each constituent may have its own separate terms and conditions in addition. Of course creating composite digital objects may be subject to copyright and any other legal restrictions pertaining to its constituent objects. 

Each of these services share with Pathways the notion of simple web based interfaces for creating and accessing content over the web. However a key distinction of Pathways is its focus on complex digital objects as units of content as compared to single content byte streams e.g. a file . Another distinction of the Pathways work is that it is primarily intended to be an interoperability model for managed repositories as distinguished from more nebulous storage services on the open web.

This maps to the Kahn Wilensky notion that digital objects can contain nested digital objects. An example of the utility of this recursive relationship is modeling of an overlay journal.

An infrastructure that would leverage the value of the digital objects hosted by those repositories by making them accessible for use and re use in many contexts. Digital objects are the building blocks of a global scholarly communication federation in which each individual digital object can be the starting point for value chains a global workflow or value chain across repositories with digital objects from repositories being the subjects of the workflow.

Building a Distributed Standards based Repository Federation The China Digital Museum Project Robert Tansley

The principal aim of the China Digital Museum Project is to enable these universities to provide infrastructure based on DSpacel to store manage preserve and disseminate the digitized versions of the artifacts. In the final phase of the project there will be approximately 100 university museums with digital artifacts stored in federated DSpace installations.

Finally a note on terminology used in this article numerous potential terms exist to describe the various kinds of digital content in the system. Where the term Object is used capitalized it refers to a complex digital object as in the Kahn Wilensky framework including some metadata and one or more bit streams. Bit stream is used to describe an individual file or DataStream and to be consistent with the DSpace data model

How should we rethink citation in a natively digital scholarly communication system We think of citation as a particular type of re use of the cited digital object in the context of the citing digital object. Imagine being able to drag a machine readable representation of a digital object hosted by one repository and to drop it into the citing object that once finalized is ingested into another repository. Now imagine being able to do the same for the citing object etc. Assuming that the machine readable representations being dragged and dropped contain the appropriate properties the result would be a natively machine traversable citation graph that might span repositories worldwide.

There are numerous other examples in scholarly communication of workflows across distributed repositories. These include the mirroring of digital objects for preservation purposes the creation of repositories that host virtual collections of objects that are physically hosted in other repositories the progression of units of scholarly communication through the registration certification awareness archiving chain 1 and the re use of datasets hosted by various repositories for the creation and publication of a new dataset. In order to enable such workflows participating repositories will need some common interface to the world.

Determining the nature of this interface is the subject of our Pathways explorations and this article reports the insights that we have gained thus far.

The complex nature of the assets led to an investigation regarding existing approaches to wrap constituent data streams into a single wrapper structure that could function as an Open Archival Information System 15 Archival Information Package OAIS AIP .

This quickly led to an interest in representing assets by means of XML wrappers which itself resulted in the selection of the MPEG 21 Digital Item Declaration MPEG 21 DID 17 43 as the sole way to represent assets as Digital Objects in aDORe.

We use the term surrogate to indicate concrete serializations of digital objects according to our data model. The purpose of this serialization is to allow exchange of information about digital objects from one service to another and thus propagate them through value chains. We use RDF XML for constructing our surrogates because it is useful for representing arbitrary sub graphs.

To understand this expanded view of citation imagine being able to drag a machine readable representation of a digital object hosted by some repository and to drop it into the citing object that once finalized is submitted into another repository. Now imagine being able to do the same for the citing object ad infinitum.

Pathways Augmenting interoperability across scholarly repositories Beyond meeting our basic requirements the OpenURL Framework has the following attractive properties it allows information about the context in which the obtain request took place to be conveyed. This information may allow delivery of context sensitive service requests. Of particular interest is information about the agent requesting the obtain service the Requester . This information could convey identity and this would allow responding differently to the same service request depending on whether the requesting agent is a human or machine. Similarly different humans could receive different disseminations based on recorded preferences or access rights. The OpenURL Framework is purposely generic and extensible and would also support to convey the characteristics of a user s terminal the user s network context and or the user s location via the Requester entity. Though this type of context related tuning may not be important when requesting surrogates of digital objects it may prove to be essential when requesting rich services pertaining to data streams.

The DOI System is for identifying content objects in the digital environment. DOI names are assigned to any entity for use on digital networks. They are used to provide current information including where they or information about them can be found on the Internet. Information about a digital object may change over time including where to find it but its DOI name will not change. The DOI System provides a framework for persistent identification managing intellectual content managing metadata linking customers with content suppliers facilitating electronic commerce and enabling automated management of media. DOI names can be used for any form of management of any data whether commercial or non commercial.

Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations XSLT is an XML based language used for the transformation of XML documents. XSLT is designed to transform XML documents into other XML or human readable documents. The original document is not changed rather a new document is created based on the content of an existing one. The new document may be serialized output by the processor in standard XML syntax or in another format such as HTML or plain text. XSLT is most often used to convert data between different XML schemas or to convert XML data into HTML or XHTML documents for web pages creating a Dynamic web page or into an intermediate XML format that can be converted to PDF documents. XSLT can also be considered as a template processor.

The term was taken over by the Artificial Intelligence community and one classic text book Russell 1995 gives several definitions including A particular theory of the nature of being or existence. John Sowa in his highly recommended book Knowledge Representation
