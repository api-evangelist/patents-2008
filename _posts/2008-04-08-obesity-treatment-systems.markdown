Obesity is a public health problem of extreme national and international importance. There are an estimated 60 million obese adults and 2 million obese adolescents in the United States as of 2004. By some estimates there are 1 billion obese individuals worldwide. Indeed to highlight the worldwide importance of the disease a recent report estimated that over there are over 60 million obese individuals in China a 10 fold increase since 2000. Obesity affects the life quality and productivity of those effected and leads to long term health related complications such as diabetes and heart disease. Some researchers estimate that if the obesity epidemic is not brought under control it could quickly overwhelm societal resources.

To date surgery is the only proven method for inducing substantial weight loss. The mechanism behind the success of surgery is in many cases not known because obesity is such a complex multifactorial disease. Some researchers propose that surgery does no more than provide biofeedback for appetite retraining. Other researchers maintain that surgery alters the physiology of the patient such that satiety is induced earlier or fewer nutrients are absorbed. Nonetheless the consensus among most obesity researchers is that at the current time long term weight loss is only possible by surgical means and that the success of surgery is due to a multifactorial set of changes.

Over the past four decades there have been numerous surgical procedures and devices developed to treat those who suffer from morbid obesity. In general there are two physiologic components of all past and current procedures malabsorption and mechanical restriction volume reduction. Newer methods and devices include stimulation devices such as neurostimulators and muscle stimulators. In general these devices will require further research and development before they will be used to treat obese patients as a single therapy.

Many of the procedures performed in the past have proven to be impractical dangerous and or detrimental to patient health and are now of historical importance only. One example of a failed procedure was the jejuno ileo bypass in which a malabsorptive state was created through the bypass of a large portion of the intestine through the creation of a surgical anastomosis between the jejunum and the ileum. While patients initially lost a great deal of weight liver failure or liver damage occurred in over one third of the patients necessitating reversal of the surgical procedures.

One of the first restrictive type surgical procedures was the so called stomach stapling operation in which a row of horizontal staples was placed across the upper stomach and then several staples were removed from the staple line to create an opening the os for a small amount of food but not too much food. This procedure was mostly restrictive leading to an early feeling of satiety. This surgery was abandoned because 70 80 of patients had inadequate weight loss due to staple line dehiscence i.e. the staples pulled through the stomach wall . A procedure to stabilize the staple line was performed by Smith et. al. Lindsay B. Smith Modification of the Gastric Partitioning Operation For Morbid Obesity. Am. J. Surgery 142 December 1981 in which the staple line was buttressed in the region where the staples were removed using teflon pledgets with sutures passing through the middle of the pledgets. The purpose of the pledgets was to buttress the suture and distribute the load across the suture to the pledget thereby preventing the suture from pulling through the stomach and therefore stabilizing the os. The outcomes showed that the suture buttress was unequivocally able to prevent the suture from tearing through the stomach wall indeed over 90 of the patients showed excellent weight loss at 18 months.

The Roux en Y The Roux bypass operation has become the most commonly performed surgical procedure to treat the morbidly obese in the United States. It combines a small degree of malabsorption with a 90 reduction in the volume of the stomach. In the United States 150 000 Roux procedures were performed in the year 2004. This number is expected to rise to 500 000 procedures by 2007. The procedure actually has been performed since the late 1970 s but has evolved substantially over the past three decades into a relatively safe and effective procedure indeed the long term data are very good. The advent of laparoscopic surgery and hence the laparoscopic Roux en Y bypass in combination with excellent follow up results from the open and laparoscopic procedure are reasons for the proliferation of the Roux procedure.

Despite the efficacy of the Roux procedure and the recent laparoscopic improvements it remains a highly invasive procedure with substantial morbidity including a 1 2 surgical mortality a 20 30 incidence of pulmonary morbidity such as pneumonia pulmonary embolism etc. and a 1 4 chance of leak at the anastomotic site which can result in a spectrum of consequences ranging from an extended hospital stay to death. Furthermore it is not a good option for adolescents in whom the long term consequences of malabsorption are not known. In addition many patients resist such an irreversible life altering procedure.

The Roux procedure requires general anesthesia and muscle paralysis which in the morbidly obese population is not of small consequence. There is also a substantial rate of anastomotic stricture which results in severe lifestyle changes for patients. As an example many patients are forced to vomit after meals. Furthermore although minor when compared to previous malabsorptive e.g. jejuno ileal bypass procedures the malabsorption created by the Roux en Y procedure can dramatically affect the quality of life of patients who undergo the procedure for example they may experience gas bloating symptoms of the dumping syndrome and or dysphasia. In addition these patients can experience very early fullness such that they are forced to vomit following meals.

Recently minimally invasive procedures and devices which create a feeling of early satiety have been introduced into the marketplace in an attempt to address some of the issues above. The LAP BAND is a band which encircles the stomach at the region of the fundus cardia junction it is a restrictive procedure similar to stomach stapling. It requires general anesthesia a pneumoperitoneum muscle paralysis and extensive dissection of the stomach at the level the gastroesophageal junction. It also requires continual adjustment of the band or restriction portion of the device. Although less invasive than the Roux procedure and potentially reversible the LAP BAND is nonetheless quite invasive. It also does not reduce the volume of the stomach by any great extent and some patients report a feeling of hunger much of the time. Furthermore once implanted the Lap Band although it is adjustable by percutaneous means is in fact very difficult to adjust and many iterative adjustments are required before it is made right.

Long term clinical follow up reveals that the banding procedure results in many complications. In a recently published article Camerini et. al. Thirteen Years of Follow up in Patients with Adjustable Silicone Gastric Banding for Obesity Weight Loss and Constant Rate of Late Specific Complications. Obesity Surgery 14 1343 1348 the authors reported a 60 prevalence of late band removal secondary to complications such as erosion slippage of the band infection or lack of effectiveness. Nonetheless the LAP BAND as a procedure is becoming very popular across the world as it is a less invasive and reversible procedure. The weight loss in long term trials is considered adequate by some and inadequate by many across various studies the average weight loss is approximately 40 of excess body weight which is well below the weight loss in the Roux VBG and duodenal switch procedures see below .

Other procedures which have been tried in the past and which offer varying degrees of weight loss include several variations of the original gastroplasty procedures. These procedures represent an evolution of the so called stomach stapling procedure discussed above. These procedures were attempted prior to and concomitant with the evolution of the Roux en Y. They became popular despite offering less weight loss than the Roux because of their substantially less invasive nature and possible reversibility.

One such example is called the vertical banded gastroplasty or VBG which again involves the creation of a restricting os for food. In the VBG the border of the os is the lesser curvature of the stomach which is less apt to dilate than the fundus region of the stomach. Furthermore the procedure completely excludes the fundus which is thought to easily dilate and in fact is physiologically programmed to dilate during meals . . . so called receptive relaxation. Dilation of the fundus as a result of continued overeating is a major reason for failure of the Lap Band and in some cases the Roux procedure and the development of the VBG was intended to improve upon these outcomes. One issue with the VBG is that as practiced today it is not reversible nor is it adjustable and it is difficult to perform laparoscopically. As in the horizontal gastroplasty the VBG utilizes standard staplers which as in the horizontal gastroplasty are unreliable when applied to the stomach. In the case of the VBG the row of staples runs parallel to the lesser curvature of the stomach. An important reason for recurrent weight gain in the VBG is in fact recannulation of the staple line leading to a so called gastro gastric fistula.

A recent prospective randomized trial compared the VBG to the adjustable banding procedure and found that the VBG was overwhelmingly superior to the banding procedure Morino et. al. Laparoscopic Adjustable Silicone Gastric Banding Versus Vertical Banded Gastroplasty in Morbidly Obese Patients. Annals of Surgery. Vol. 238 6 pps. 835 842 . Twenty five percent of the patients in the banding group returned to the operating room whereas there were no returns to the operating room in the gastroplasty group. The degree of weight loss was close to 60 of excess body weight after three years in the gastroplasty group and closer to 40 of excess body weight in the banding group. Although in this study the VBG was successfully performed laparoscopically the laparoscopic VBG procedure is in fact difficult to perform because the procedure is not standardized and a tool box does not exist for the surgeon to carry out the procedure furthermore the procedure is not a reversible one and relies on the inherently unreliable stapler systems.

A recent meta analysis and systematic review Buchwald et. al. Bariatric Surgery A Systematic Review and Meta analysis JAMA vol. 292 no 14. pps 1724 1737 indicated that vertical gastroplasty avg. excess weight loss of 68.2 is superior to adjustable banding avg excess weight loss of 47.5 and gastric bypass avg excess weight loss of 61.6 .

The Magenstrasse and Mill M M procedure is an evolving gastroplasty technique wherein the greater curvature of the stomach is separated stapled and cut from the path of food leaving a tube of stomach the Magenstrasse or street of the stomach which is comprised of the lesser curvature. This procedure is similar to the VBG except that the longitudinal staple line of the stomach extends further along the lesser curvature and into the antrum. The theory behind leaving the antral mill is that it will continue to serve its normal function of mixing grinding retropulsion and well orchestrated expulsion of chyme into the duodenum. An authoritative study on the operation is incorporated herein by reference Johnston et. al. The Magenstrasse and Mill Operation for Morbid Obesity Obesity Surgery 13 10 16 .

In summary the vertical gastroplasty procedure appears to be superior to the banding procedure. However the vertical gastroplasty procedure is not easily performed laparoscopically and furthermore it is not easily reversible. Therefore a need exists to standardize the vertical banded gastroplasty and create a safer procedure which is also easy to perform is durable and is reversible.

The intragastric balloon is not a new concept. The intragastric balloon is meant to displace volume within the stomach such that a smaller volume of food leads to an earlier feeling of satiety. Currently intragastric balloons on the market are not fixed to the stomach and consequently can lead to complications such as obstruction and mucosal erosion. To avoid these complications the balloons are removed after a maximum of six months. In a prospective non randomized unblinded study Sallet et. al. Brazilian Multicenter Study of the Intragastric Balloon Obesity Surgery 14 991 998 the average excess weight loss was 48.3 after 1 year. However the incidence of nausea and vomiting was 40 and epigastric pain was 20 balloon impaction occurred in 0.6 of patients. A balloon which is fixed to the wall of the stomach could potentially improve the intragastric balloon device and allow longer term implantation.

More recently there has been an effort to develop even less invasive devices and procedures which do not involve incisions at all. For the most part these procedures are performed from within the stomach with an endoscope and by a physician with a high degree of endoscopic skill. For example U.S. Pat. No. 6 558 400 describes methods and devices to create partitions in the stomach. Anchors or staplers applied through an endoscope from within the stomach are used to accomplish the partitions. Similarly U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004 0122456 describes another set of methods and devices to reduce the volume of the stomach. Expandable anchors are deployed both on the anterior and posterior wall of the stomach using an endoscope. Flexible sutures are brought out of the patient s mouth and the sutures are crimped together within the stomach in order to bring the walls of the stomach closer together. The final configuration has a discontinuous connector positioned between the anterior and posterior anchors. Patent application U.S. Pat. No. 6 773 440 describes a device which is advanced through an endoscope and grasps or applies suction to a fold of mucosa to apply anchors through the mucosal and serosal layers of the stomach.

Endoscopic procedures to manipulate the stomach can be time consuming because of the technical difficulty of the endoscopy they also require a large endoscope through which many instruments need to be placed for these complex procedures. Due to the large size of the endoscope patients typically will require general anesthesia which limits the non invasive aspects of the procedure. Furthermore the procedures require advanced endoscopic skill which would need to be acquired by most endoscopic practitioners outside of academic institutions. Such skill adaptation can take a significant amount of time which will limit adoption of the procedure by the physician community. A further issue is that there is a limitation on the size of the anchors and devices which can be placed in the stomach because the endoscope has a maximum permissible size.

Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy PEG refers to a procedure in which a gastrocutaneous tract is created using a percutaneous procedure see below for definition . A recent update of the procedure can be found on the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons SAGES website and is incorporated herein by reference. Briefly the procedure involves insufflation of the stomach with and under visualization with an endoscope. A small incision is made in the skin and a needle is advanced into the stomach the stomach sits just under the abdominal wall when insufflated under endoscopic visualization. A feeding tube is then placed over the needle to create a gastrocutaneous tract with the feeding tube inside the tract with the needle subsequently removed. The feeding tube is secured with an external bolster to creates a tubular tract from outside the patient through the skin of the abdominal wall and residing inside the stomach. Over the ensuing weeks a permanent tract evolves between the stomach mucosa and epithelium of the skin after which the bolster can be removed without consequence. When the feeding tube is to be removed the gastrocutaneous tract will close on its own as food will preferentially be delivered antegrade the path of least resistance to the duodenum thereby allowing the tract to heal.

In some embodiments the flexible conducting material comprises two different materials constructed as a composite structure. In some embodiments the electrode comprises two different materials 1 a current conducting material 2 a tissue ingrowth material.

In other embodiments the electrode contains pores which are between 5 and 100 microns in at least one dimension.

The region behind the stomach is referred to as the lesser peritoneal sac. It is a potential space between the retroperitoneum and the posterior wall of the stomach. The proximal limit of the lesser sac is the cardia of the stomach and the distal limit is the pylorus of the stomach the superior limit is the liver and the inferior limit is the inferior border of the stomach. To the left of the midline the posterior wall of the stomach is generally free from the peritoneal surface of the lesser sac and to the right of the midline the posterior wall of the stomach is more adherent to the peritoneum of the lesser sac although the adherence is generally loose and the adhesions can be broken up rather easily with gentle dissection.

The stomach is comprised of several layers. The inner layer is the mucosa. The next layer is the submucosa followed by the outer muscular layers. Surrounding the muscular layers is the serosal layer. This layer is important with regard to implants and healing because it is the adhesive layer of the stomach that is it is the layer which when breached heals with scar tissue formation. Implants adhering to this layer are less likely or not likely to migrate into the stomach whereas implants only placed in the mucosal or submucosal layers will migrate. Reference to stomach wall or wall of the stomach as used herein include the entire thickness of the stomach including the mucosa submucosa muscular layers and serosa. The anterior wall of the stomach is the portion of the stomach closest to the muscular abdominal wall and the posterior wall of the stomach is the part of the stomach closest to the retroperitoneum.

 Transgastric fastening assembly or fastening system refers to a permanent or semi permanent implant and comprises at least one posterior anchor at least one anterior anchor and a connector to couple the posterior and anterior anchors. Fastener and anchor have their ordinary meaning and are used interchangeably in this disclosure. The connector can refer to any means of connection including but not limited to a material connection an electromagnetic or magnetic connection or a chemical connection. As used herein a connector is a coupler or linker used to materially connect the anterior and posterior anchors. As used herein the posterior anchor is the anchor in a preferred embodiment which is adjacent to the posterior wall of the stomach when deployed. The anterior anchor is the anchor in a preferred embodiment which is approximated to the anterior wall of the stomach when deployed.

As used herein and when referring to portions of a surgical instrument proximal refers to the end of the instrument which is closest to the surgeon when the instrument is used for its intended purpose and distal refers to the end of the instrument which is closest to the patient and when the instrument is used for its intended purpose. When used to refer to the gastrointestinal tract proximal is toward the mouth and distal is toward the anus.

 Laparoscopic procedure broadly refers to procedures which require pneumoperitoneum and general anesthesia. Percutaneous procedure broadly refers to surgeries which do not require general anesthesia or pneumoperitoneum. These broad terms are mutually exclusive for the purposes of the ensuing invention because the respective procedures require different levels of patient preparation and peri operative treatments and therefore define specific embodiments. Similarly endoscopic procedure refers to procedures that are performed entirely with an endoscope. In some descriptions the terminology percutaneous means is used which generically refers to placing a surgical instrument through the skin of a patient and using the surgical instrument to accomplish a surgical task in this more generic case percutaneous means can be used with or without laparoscopic means and in laparoscopic procedures. Similarly laparoscopic means generically refers to procedures performed under the guidance of an internal camera placed through the abdominal wall that is percutaneous means in this more generic sense laparoscopy can be used with or without percutaneous methodology though in most cases percutaneous means are a requirement for laparoscopic procedure. Similarly endoscopic means refers to procedures involving some level of endoscopic visualization but is not completed with the endoscope alone whereas endoscopic procedure refers to a procedure performed entirely through an endoscope. Surgery surgical procedure and surgically created have their ordinary meaning and with regard to the inventions herein is all encompassing and refers to laparoscopic surgery open surgery endoscopic surgery and percutaneous surgery.

 Patient afferent pathway refers to a pathway which transmits a signal to the sensorium of a patient for example the vagus nerve carries afferent fibers to the hypothalamus and pain centers of the brain. Patient end effector pathway refers to a pathway which directly effects a result in an end organ for example stimulation of contraction in the stomach. Patient efferent and end effector pathways can overlap and therefore the terms should not be considered mutually exclusive for example stimulation of the stomach likely stimulates some nerve fibers that travel to the sensorium and stimulation of the vagus nerve likely stimulates the stomach. Device afferent pathway refers to a pathway which transmits a sensory signal to a restriction device for example a sensor which senses food intake transmits its signal to the restriction device through a device afferent pathway. Device efferent pathway refers to a pathway which transmits a signal from a restriction device to a separate structure e.g. a device end effector pathway described below or device e.g. patient afferent pathway a patient end effector pathway or a device end effector pathway . A device end effector pathway is a signal that directly effects a device state for example the connector of a transgastric assembly is shortened or the diameter of a restriction band undergoes a change in its diameter size.

 Exogenous gastric feedback loop or exogenous satiety pathway refer to implantable systems which enhance the biologic pathways which already exist in a patient the endogenous feedback systems . For example the VBG and the Lap Band both tell the patient that he she is full and consequently to stop eating. They induce a feeling of satiety through dilation of the stomach proximal to the device this is an example of an endogenous satiety pathway . Exogenous or enhancement of these pathways refers to embodiments in which the satiety signal can be controlled and or enhanced. For example a sensor can be place on a restriction device and then a pathway such as vagal nerve stimulation can be activated in response to feedback from the sensor therefore satiety is induced at an earlier stage than if the endogenous feedback systems stomach dilation were relied upon.

 Gastric volume reducing devices procedures and systems and gastric restriction devices procedures and systems have their ordinary meanings and overlap in meaning when the walls of the stomach are brought closer together. In these cases all volume reducing procedures and restriction procedures which bring the walls of the stomach closer together necessarily overlap in meaning. Gastric restriction devices refer generally to any devices which restrict the stomach in some way. Included but not limited to are devices such as transgastric fastening assemblies laparoscopic bands e.g. the Lap Band and intragastric balloons.

 Constricting bands or restricting bands have their ordinary meaning and also refer to gastric restriction devices which surround the proximal region of the stomach. The constricting bands cause weight loss by restricting the food intake of the patient. In many cases the restricting bands are adjustable balloons which are adjustable percutaneously by way of a port implanted at the time of surgery. These bands rely on the patient to inform the surgeon about eating habits and discomfort which may limit their utility because the patient can cheat themselves. Furthermore the monthly or so follow up visits are potentially too infrequent to be useful. Gastric restriction system refers broadly to the restricting devices including both adjustable bands and devices such as transgastric fastening assemblies.

Buoyancy is a physical principle and can be defined as the tendency or capacity to remain afloat in a liquid or rise in air or gas. A device which is less buoyant than its surroundings will tend to sink and a device which is more buoyant than its surroundings will tend to float relative to its surroundings. A composite device can be more or less buoyant than its surroundings depending on the components of the composite. In some devices buoyancy is adjustable. For example a balloon filled with one fluid such as a liquid would tend to sink or be negatively buoyant in a surrounding fluid whereas the same balloon filled with another fluid such as a gas would tend to be positively buoyant in a surrounding fluid. In one example the device is filled partially with gas and partially with liquid in which case it would tend to be positively buoyant relative to its surroundings depending on the amount of gas. Some devices can be positively buoyant with a material such as a foam which traps a lot of gas inside. Some devices are more buoyant than their surroundings even though one portion of the device may be less buoyant than its surroundings. For example a composite device with a metal mesh in combination with an inflateable balloon. In this example the composite can be positively buoyant while the metal mesh itself would be negatively buoyant. Buoyancy is intimately related to density although buoyancy refers to a device in combination with its surroundings whereas density is an absolute measurement.

Furthermore the following abstract presented at the 2007 SAGES meeting in Las Vegas Nev. on Apr. 22 2007 is incorporated into this disclosure. Associated slides and data are depicted in .

Referring to one embodiment of the posterior anchor and connector are shown in a deployed configuration and reduced profile configuration . The connector is preferably made of a flexible biocompatible polymer but it can be made from various kinds of suitable biocompatible materials known to those of skill in the art including metals such as titanium and platinum metal alloys such as stainless steel nickel titanium and cobalt chromium man made polymers such as polyurethane silicone elastomers polyglycolic acid polylactic acid poly C caprolactone polyvinylidene fluoride PVDF PTFE FEP polypropylene or natural fibers such as silk bioartificial materials include allogenic and xenogenic collagen based products. These materials can be used singly or in combination when the connector has two distinct components as opposed to one . For example one portion of the connector may be bioabsorbable and another portion of the connector may be permanent or one part of the connector may be a sensor or active component and the other part a coating. The connector can be continuous or discontinuous. The connector can vary in thickness shape and rigidity. For example in the embodiment shown in the connector is substantially rod shaped with a circular cross section and is flexible. Those of skill in the art will recognize that the cross section of the connector can be any of a number of shapes such as square hexagonal oval etc. In other embodiments the connector is thin and flexible such as a surgical suture and in still others it is rigid to like a guiding rail for an anchor which travels over the rail. The connector can have a thickness ranging from 100 microns e.g. suture to several millimeters depending on the application. Although a single connector is depicted as being attached to the posterior anchor those skilled in the art will recognize that more than one or several connectors can be connected to the anchor at different points on the anchor or as a combination attached to one point on the anchor e.g. a bundle . In some embodiments the connector is made from a thermoresponsive material such as a thermoresponsive polymer or metal such as shape memory alloy e.g. nickel titanium alloy . In other embodiments the connector is composed of at least one material which conducts an electrical current through from the anterior anchor to the posterior anchor or from the posterior anchor to the anterior anchor.

In a preferred embodiment the posterior anchor is made from a biocompatible radio opaque or magneto opaque semi rigid polymer it can also be made from various kinds of suitable materials known to those of skill in the art including metals metal alloys plastics natural materials or combinations thereof as discussed above in relation to the connector . In some embodiments the anchor is made from a conductive material and in other embodiments the anchor is made from a combination of conducting non conducting and or semi conducting materials. The posterior anchor can be solid or alternatively can be porous mesh like lattice like or umbrella like. In some embodiments the anchor contains a potential space on the inside which can be expanded by a fluid e.g. gas or liquid . In a preferred embodiment the posterior anchor is porous or has a porous mesh attached to it to encourage fibrous ingrowth such that it becomes permanently attached to the stomach or intestinal wall. Coatings can be added to the anchor to encourage tissue ingrowth of course such coatings do not limit the ability for the interior of the anchor to be a potential space for expansion by a fluid. In other embodiments the posterior anchor is solid and or treated to discourage tissue ingrowth e.g. with a silicone coating . In other embodiments the posterior anchor has a xenograft or allograft material attached to the anchor. In a preferred embodiment the posterior anchor is disc shaped but those of skill in the art will recognize that other embodiments are possible such as those shown in or disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004 0122456 which is herein incorporated by reference note particularly the description of anchor structures. The posterior anchor in other embodiments can be rectangular or diamond shaped. The posterior anchor can also be bioabsorbable in whole or in part in some embodiments. The largest dimension of the posterior anchor can range from less than 1 mm to about 15 cm depending on the application and the manner in which it is implanted see below . In the case where the posterior anchor is a disc shape the diameter is considered the largest dimension.

In the embodiment shown in the connector is fastened to the posterior anchor at an attachment point which is preferably a permanent e.g. welded or molded connection. Such a weld or connection can comprise for example a thermoformed polymer a metallic weld or a molded or other integral structure. In a preferred embodiment a biocompatible thermoformed polymer is used because of its flexibility and ability to yield to the continuous motion of the stomach. More preferably the connector and posterior anchor are produced as a single continuous structure e.g. through an injection molding process .

Other suitable means of fastening the connector to the posterior anchor are also contemplated and do not necessarily result in a connector and posterior anchor becoming permanently attached. For example in one embodiment shown in one end of the connector is passed through a hole near the center of the posterior anchor and a stop such as a knot or enlarged molded region is formed on the end of the connector to prevent its passage back through the hole in the posterior anchor. In this embodiment the posterior anchor can be free to move along the length of the connector but is prevented from being removed from one end of the connector by the stop .

In the embodiment shown in the posterior anchor preferably has a deployed configuration and a reduced profile configuration . The posterior anchor can be deformed to a folded configuration wherein its profile is reduced to facilitate insertion of the anchor through a laparoscopic port or through the walls of the stomach or other tissue as described in more detail below. In one embodiment the posterior anchor is made of a semi flexible material having shape memory so that once the anchor is deployed within the patient it will return to its original shape shown in preventing it from being easily pulled back through the tissue. Preferably the posterior anchor is inflatable in place of or in addition to having shape memory which allows for a much larger deployed profile relative to its undeployed profile see below . In one embodiment the anchor can have both shape memory as well as inflateability in which case it can be made more or less buoyant than the surrounding tissue. For example in one embodiment the anchor can be inflated with a liquid a liquid and a gas or just a gas depending on the buoyancy desired within the system. In some embodiments the shape memory is activated by passing a current through the material. In some embodiments the posterior anchor contains an intrinsic magnetic ferromagnetic electromagnetic piezoelectric paramagnetic magnetorheologic or other electrically or thermally adjustable material and can apply a force to another part or portion of the anchor assembly for example an electroactive polymer or a metal such as nitinol can be used. These materials can also serve as components of sensors e.g. strain pressure tension stress accelerometry . In some embodiments the posterior anchor contains electrodes placed at the surface of the material such that they integrate with the organ they contact e.g. the stomach .

In a preferred embodiment shown in the posterior anchor is inflatable. The anchor has an inflatable disc shaped body which is readily deformable when in its reduced profile e.g. uninflated configuration as shown in . In the preferred embodiment the posterior anchor body is disc shaped but those of skill in the art will recognize that other embodiments are possible such as those shown in or in which the inflatable anchors are square shaped rectangular or amorphous or have a shape disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004 0122456 which is herein incorporated by reference note particularly the description of anchor structures. The body can be inflated with a substance delivered through a hollow connector . When the interior space of the anchor body is inflated the anchor assumes its deployed configuration shown in . Once the body is inflated it can become substantially less compliant yet remain soft and pliable. The anchor can be inflated from its reduced profile to its deployed profile. The size of the reduced profile can be less than 1 cm or less than 5 mm and the size of the deployed profile can range from 1 cm to greater than 5 cm or greater than 10 cm. In the reduced profile the anchor can fit into a conduit having a length inside the conduit which is longer than it width so as to fit through the conduit.

The inflatable posterior anchor can have a valve located between the anchor body and the connector . Alternatively the valve is located in the portion of the connector located outside the patient the valve e.g. stopcock type valve being controlled by the operator until the anterior anchor is placed see below . In this alternative embodiment the filling substance is trapped in the posterior anchor after the anterior anchor is deployed and the connector is cut and sealed preferably flush with the anterior anchor see below . The filling substance can be a gas liquid or material which changes phase with time i.e. it may harden cure polymerize or become a gel with time . Other materials such as magnetorheologic fluids for example magnetic particles immersed in an oil can be used as well and such fluids would interface with the electrical systems described below. Preferably the surface of the posterior anchor adjacent to the posterior wall of the stomach has a mesh fixed to it to encourage tissue ingrowth. In some embodiments part or all of the anchor material is comprised of a biodegradable material.

In some embodiments the anchor assembly and in particular the posterior anchor and connector combination are used for extragastric volume reduction of a region of the stomach see below for more detail . In this embodiment the posterior anchor can be adapted to be an extragastric restriction device and the anterior anchor connector system is used for fixation of the device to the abdominal wall. In this embodiment it may be desirable for the extragastric restriction device to have a shape that conforms to an area of the stomach such as the GE junction. The connector can serve as a conduit to fill the extragastric balloon and can further be equipped with a valve to fill the extragastric balloon and prevent leaking of its contents. The transverse width of the GE junction is typically 0.5 cm to 10 cm in almost the entire population and 1 cm to 5 cm in the majority of the population. The extragastric balloon should be shaped such that it can surround 180 270 degrees of the GE junction or from 90 degrees to 360 degrees. In some embodiments the balloon can completely surround the GE junction and in these embodiments the balloon can be continuous or discontinuous.

In some embodiments the extragastic restriction device is filled with gas liquid a gel or a combination of these fluids. As described below the extragastric compression device can have multiple compartments and each can be filled with a gas liquid or a combination of liquids and gases.

Although depict a single connector contacting the posterior anchor those skilled in the art will recognize that more than one connector can be used to contact the posterior anchor. The more than one connector can be placed in any arrangement along the posterior anchor e.g. in a row in a pattern along the perimeter or concentrated in the center . The more than one connector can be bundled and attached in one place on a second anchor or in multiple points on a second anchor. In the embodiments where the posterior anchor is an extragastric restriction device the connectors fix the anchor to the abdominal wall with additional anchors with the abdominal wall fascia.

Other methods of introducing adjustability of the transgastric anchor assembly exist as well and are useful in some embodiments. For example the suture can be produced from a material such as nickel titanium alloy the tension of which can be adjusted with an electrical current or other means of introducing a temperature increase in the alloy. In some embodiments below the tension of the nickel titanium alloy can be adjusted depending on an input parameter such as for example the output from a sensor integral to a gastric restriction device see below for more detail . In another embodiment a nickel titanium alloy is a novel component of a restricting band such as the Lap Band see below or an extragastric restriction device which does not completely surround the stomach. In some embodiments both a transgastric assembly and a restricting band are implanted in the patient and in some embodiments the transgastric fastening assembly has an adjustable nitinol connector and in other embodiments the restricting band has a nitinol ring which is adjustable via electrical means. In some embodiments both the transgastric anchor and the restricting band both have adjustable nitinol components. Alternative electroactive materials include electroactive polymers.

In any of the embodiments above the connector can serve as a sensor to detect the tension imposed on it by the two fasteners moving in opposite directions. In embodiments where the connector serves as a sensor the connector can be composed of one or more different materials. One of the materials can be a sensor or sensing material and the other serves as a material for mechanical strength. For example a piezoelectric strain gauge can be used as a strain sensor as can an electroactive polymer. As discussed below the connector sensor can serve as the afferent device afferent limb of a feedback loop. The efferent device efferent pathway of the feedback loop can be an electrical lead which communicates with and stimulates a pathway such as the vagus nerve patient afferent pathway a sympathetic pathway such as the celiac plexus or a device efferent pathway which for example can adjust the degree of gastric volume reduction or restriction. When some or all of these efferent neural and mechanical pathways are stimulated a feeling of satiety can be created and controlled in a patient. Such pathways may decrease or eliminate problems with constricting band and stapled gastroplasties because they offer solutions to decrease the amount of pressure applied by the devices to the stomach until the pressure is needed when the patient is eating for example . Such methods and devices can potentially decrease the problems with erosion and reflux. Furthermore the adjustment of the device can be taken out of the hands of the patient and controlled by the device and the surgeon. Furthermore battery power can be conserved by apply electrical stimulation only when the patient is eating.

In an embodiment the connector or part of the connector can take the form of a strain gauge in which a potential is generated which is proportional to the tension stress applied to it. The strain measurement in the connector can be transmitted wirelessly or through a wired connection to an effector limb patient or device efferent pathway of the circuit or to an external receiver. In other embodiments the strain measurement is transmitted through a wired circuit e.g. from the strain gauge directly to the efferent pathway of the feedback loop . In one example the strain gauge is an electrically activateable polymer electroactive polymer in a separate embodiment the efferent end of the feedback loop is also an electroactive polymer in other embodiments both the afferent and efferent limbs of the feedback system are made from electroactive polymers. In some embodiments the efferent effector pathway is stimulation of the stomach wall surrounding the fasteners or the stomach wall in a place some distance away from the transgastric fastener assembly such as the peri pyloric region. Stimulation of a patient end effector e.g. the stomach pathway can be transmitted through the fastener itself or through a separately attached electrode.

In an alternative embodiment the efferent limb of the feedback loop is an electrical lead which communicates with a cutaneous stimulator to negatively enforce excessive feeding behavior. In this embodiment feedback to the patient is not necessarily a satiety signal but a cutaneous feedback signal which alerts the patient to an overfeeding state. In another embodiment the feedback pathway is a computer algorithm which alerts the patient that they are overeating or saves the data until sometime in the future then printing out the data for the patient or the physician. In other embodiments the efferent limb of the feedback system generates loud sounds or vibrations.

The algorithm between the afferent and efferent pathway can be a simple one in which the efferent pathway has an on or off status depending on the level of stimulation from the afferent pathway. Alternatively the relationship between the afferent and efferent pathways is non linear. For example as the strain increases the efferent signal increases two three or fold. If the strain increases further the efferent signal can increase in an exponential manner for example eight to ten fold . Other patterns are possible as well and these patterns can be programmed into the controller or signal generator and represent the algorithmic aspects of the stimulation system. Nevertheless the relationship between inputs and outputs of the system can be programmed from a location external to the devices and system e.g. the surface of the patient or a remote location such as a physician s office .

In an alternative embodiment it is contemplated that the connector can have notches which interact with gripping elements in a ratchet and pawl mechanism similar to that used in cable ties providing a one way adjustability in which the posterior and anterior anchors can be moved toward each other but not away from each other.

An inflation tube is used to inflate and deflate the anterior anchor. This inflation tube may or may not have a valve. In one preferred embodiment the anterior anchor is filled with gas or fluid through the inflation tube and the fluid is held inside the anchor through an external e.g. stopcock valve controlled by the operator. When the inflation tube is cut at the end of the procedure the inflation line is crimped closed thereby locking the inflating substance inside the anchor. Alternatively the shears used to cut the inflation line can be metal and an electrocautery current can be applied through the shears and to the inflation line to weld it closed.

In the anterior anchor is in its reduced profile i.e. uninflated configuration with the connector of passing through the hole in the body of the anchor. When in this configuration the anchor body is readily deformable and the gripping elements and teeth do not significantly engage the connector . This allows movement of the anterior anchor along the length of the connector in the directions illustrated by the arrows in . Once the anterior anchor is in the desired position along the connector the anterior anchor is inflated by a filling substance delivered through the inflation tube and the anchor assumes its deployed i.e. inflated configuration as shown in the gripping elements and teeth engage the connector thus restricting movement of the anterior anchor in one or both directions along the length of the connector . The filling substance can be a gas liquid or material which changes phase with time i.e. it may harden cure polymerize or become a gel with time . In some embodiments the filler substance is a magnetorheologic fluid the viscosity of which can be changed with a magnetic field e.g. it can be turned on or off .

In this method the anchoring frame can be placed inside the abdomen to contact the stomach or abdominal wall. The frame can be passed over a connector rail or suture and the locked against the stomach or abdominal wall. The anterior anchor can comprise a material which is less compliant than another region of the anchor leading to a directionality of movement as the anchor is inflated.

In a preferred embodiment the anterior anchor is made from a biocompatible radio or magneto opaque polymer but it can also be made from various kinds of suitable materials known to those of skill in the art including metals metal alloys plastics natural materials or combinations thereof as disclosed above the anchor material can also be a biodegradable material. The anterior anchor can be solid or alternatively can be porous mesh like umbrella like or lattice like.

In a preferred embodiment the anterior anchor is porous mesh like umbrella like or lattice like to encourage fibrous ingrowth such that it becomes permanently attached to the stomach wall. Coatings can be added to the anchor or a mesh material such as polypropylene can be fixed to the anchor surface such that it touches the anterior stomach wall and encourages tissue ingrowth. In other embodiments the anterior anchor is solid and treated to discourage tissue ingrowth with materials such as silicone PTFE or FEP which are generally hydrophobic and non reactive. In one embodiment one side of the anchor is produced from PTFE and the other side of the anchor is produced from polypropylene. In other embodiments the anterior anchor has a xenograft or allograft material attached to the anchor which can encourage tissue ingrowth. In a preferred embodiment the anterior anchor is disc shaped and substantially flat but those of skill in the art will recognize that other embodiments are possible for example the anterior anchor can be elongate and or continuous and can range in size from 5 mm to 10 cm in which case it can traverse the length or width of the stomach. As described below this anchor can be used as an extragastric restriction device with one or more compartments or materials attached. Its buoyancy can be changed by these one or more materials or the buoyancy can be changed by different amounts and or combinations of fluids within the anchor.

In some embodiments a system is described in which the multiple anchors are connected by the connectors and the multiple anchors each have a characteristic buoyancy depending on the combination of materials and or fillers inside. This configuration can add flexibility to the system as each anchor can be placed on different regions of the stomach. In some embodiments the combination of anchors and connectors forms a ring around the stomach or traverse the stomach from anterior to posterior.

In some embodiments the anterior anchors can have electrodes which can communicate electrically with a tissue e.g. the stomach after the anterior anchors are positioned in contact with the tissue e.g. the stomach . The electrodes can pass through the material to communicate electrically with the connector traveling through the anterior fastener. The electrodes can communicate with other effector pathways e.g. the vagus nerve or the muscle of the stomach located at different anatomic regions from the anterior fastener. The electrodes can travel with or along the connectors delivering current to the anchors or the tissue surrounding the anchors.

In any of the above embodiments the anterior and posterior anchors as well as the connector can have one or more magnets electromagnetic paramagnetic magnetorheologic or ferromagnetic materials disposed within or on their surfaces. Such magnet can serve a variety of purposes. In one example the magnets serve as actuators to forcefully maintain the walls of the stomach together through their inherent and continuous or discontinuous in the case of an electromagnet magnetic interaction. In other embodiments the magnets serve as sensors to sense the amount of food taken in by a patient in this embodiment a change in a magnetic field relative movement of the magnets is detected as an inductive current and can be correlated to food intake. Such sensing mechanisms are well known in the mechanical arts. In another embodiment the anchors contain a magnetorheologic fluid which can respond to an electrical current. When stimulated with a magnetic field the magnetorheologic fluid will undergo a change in viscosity and create a more or less compliant anchor or connector. In this embodiment once electrically charged the increase in viscosity will enhance the effect of the anchors in creating restriction or volume reduction or both of the stomach for example .

The above devices and methods can further be adapted to create a connection or an anastomosis such as a gastrojejunostomy jejunojejunostomy or ileocolostomy between two body lumens. A gastrojejunostomy is the major anastomotic component of the Roux n Y bypass procedure the jejunojejunostomy being the second component. depicts the cardia and fundus region of a stomach. An elongate tube commonly referred to in the medical arts as a nasogastric tube is adapted to serve a similar function to the connectors described above the nasogastric connector the nasogastric tube can further have one or more independent lumens which are fixed or translateable with respect to the other lumen or lumens and then fixable with respect to the other lumens. The proximal end of the elongate tube is accessible to an operator outside a patient and the distal end of the elongate tube is manipulateable via the proximal end of the elongate tube .

The lumens can communicate with expandable elements or anchors along the connector and or communicate with the gastrointestinal lumen. In one embodiment one lumen communicates with one expandable element and another lumen communicates with another expandable element on the elongate structure. In a further embodiment an additional lumen not shown in the elongate structure communicates with the region between the expandable elements so that the quality of a connection between the two body lumens can be interrogated.

An expandable element is further associated with the distal end of the connector . As described above the expandable element or anchor can expand from an undeployed to a deployed state where the diameter of the tube in the deployed state is larger than the diameter of the tube in the undeployed state. Any of the materials devices and or configurations mentioned above can be used in this embodiment. In this embodiment a hole e.g. enterotomy in the body lumen is created by a surgeon during a surgical procedure with or without assistance from the elongate structure the enterotomy is approximately the size of the undeployed expandable element .

A second surgically created enterotomy in a portion of a second body lumen for example small intestine allows for the connector nasogastric tube to be further placed into the small intestine . The diameter of the connector nasogastric tube defines the ultimate diameter of the anastomosis between the stomach and the small intestine. Typically in the Roux en Y procedure the diameter of the anastomosis is very difficult to define accurately. The diameter of the connector nasogastric tube can therefore be chosen to satisfy a pre specified requirement for the diameter of an anastomosis. The expandable element is then expanded in the small intestine and serves to enable the small intestine to be urged against the stomach . As described above the expandable elements can be produced from any of a number of materials including shape memory materials balloons magnets etc.

A second expandable element is slideable along the nasogastric tube connector. In one embodiment a separate lumen can communicate and control the second expandable element . The separate lumen can be slideable with respect to the first lumen of the nasaogastric tube and is also lockable with respect to the first lumen so that the first and second lumens and therefore the first and second exapandable elements cannot slide with respect to each other . The individual lumens can be locked at the proximal end of the nasogastric tube connector by the operator. Alternatively the separate lumen can be fixed with respect to the first lumen and the second expandable element is itself slideable and lockable along the separate lumen the second expandable element can communicate with the separate lumen for actuation into the expanded state. Once the first and second expandable elements are expanded the body lumens e.g. small intestine and the stomach can be urged toward one another in compression as shown in

After the urging step the nasogastric connectors or lumens can be fixed with respect to one another so that compression is applied between the two expandable elements and hence between the serosa of the two body lumens. The nasogastric connectors can be fixed temporarily e.g. during application of an adhesive or more permanently e.g. 3 7 days after a procedure with respect to one another depending on the method of creating an anastomosis between the two body lumens.

In one method of creating the anastomosis between body lumens the expandable elements are comprised of magnets or electromagnets which attract one another. In this embodiment the nasogastric connectors can be fixed by virtue of the magnets attracting one another maintaining the nasogastric connectors fixed with respect to one another with the body lumens in between. In another embodiment the expandable anchors are held fixed with respect to one another by virtue of the lumens of the nasogastric connectors being fixed with respect to one another described above . The amount of compression created by any of these embodiments can be sensed with a tensiometer via the nasogastric connector or connectors. The compression between the body lumens can be applied for any period of time in order to produce an anastomosis. For example the compression can be applied for a period of time during an operation when an adhesive or sutures are applied to the apposed body lumens. Alternatively the compression is applied over a longer period of time to allow for natural healing natural compression anastomosis of the anastomosis e.g. 3 7 days . During a 3 7 day time period the patient can be fed through a lumen of the nasogastric connector . A 3 7 day time period is long enough to allow for healing of an anastomosis or a leak from an anastomosis. With the current embodiment the degree of compression of the anastomosis can be defined by a tensiometer.

In another embodiment an additional element is applied over the nasogastric connector or near the connector but around the apposition of the body lumens. This additional element is applied to the nasogastric connector during the surgical procedure or is a component of the nasogastric connector when it is placed into the body lumens. The purpose of this additional element is to facilitate connection between the body lumens. In this capacity element can be adhesive in nature or can be activated to be adhesive in nature. This element can be magnetic paramagnetic or ferromagnetic potentially enhancing the magnetic power between the other two elements . In one example the adhesive element is compatible with a tissue glue e.g. cyanoacrylate fibrin glue polyethylene glycol based sealants and glutaraldehyde based sealants to enhance bonding to the outer portions of the body lumens. In one example cyanoacrylate was applied to SIS Surgisis Cook Corp Indianapolis Ind. after compression was created with a nasogastric connector. The burst pressure of the anastomotic connection was 59 mm of mercury and the anastomosis was created in three minutes.

In other embodiments element is responsive to activation by an electromagnetic means such as radiofrequency energy or optical energy. In some embodiments the material of the element is chosen to facilitate adhesion. Examples of such materials include biomimetic materials see above or adhesive nanomaterials for example US patent application 20040250950 to Dubrow et. al. which describes devices comprising superadhesive nanomaterials which can be used in this embodiment and herein incorporated by reference .

In some embodiments element is a sensor which when in place can detect the strain or stress of a peristaltic wave or a food bolus passing through the anastomosis. In other embodiments element is an adjustable restriction device an electrical stimulator or a component of a closed loop feedback system. In another embodiment element is an electroactive polymer which can act as a sphincter on command from an electrical signal.

In one embodiment adhesive devices or systems can include systems wherein light is introduced through the nasogastric connector or through a port external to a patient. The light acts directly on element or in the case where element is absent directly on the tissue in order to bond the two body lumens to one another or in other cases when an adhesive is applied directly to the region between the two body lumens. The wavelength range of the light source can be from about 250 nm to about 11 microns depending on which material is activated by the light. For example tissue adhesives may be activated in the range of about 250 to 600 nm with or without a photosensitizer and constituents of the extracellular matrix such as collagen can be activated by the infrared wavelengths 800 nm to about 11 microns.

In some embodiments the nasogastric connector is applied not to create an anastomosis but to protect an anastomosis . For example the system can be applied to an anastomosis created by staples or by hand. In these cases compression is created between the anastomosed body lumens by the expandable elements of the nasogastric connector which can then protect the anastomosis while it is healing e.g. over 1 3 days . The patient can be fed through a lumen of the nasogastric connector while compression is applied to the body lumens. In another embodiment an additional lumen is provided within the nasogastric connector this additional lumen allows for a fluid to be placed in the space created between the body lumens. The fluid can be placed under pressure because of the seal between the expandable elements the fluid and can be a dye or a contrast material in some embodiments. A leak or fault in the connection between the body lumens can then be detected by detecting leak of fluid either visually or with a pressure detector on the proximal or distal ends of the nasogastric connector. If a leak is detected then the anastomosis is already under compression and is simply left in place for a longer period of time until the leak goes away i.e. the anastomosis heals . In this embodiment the nasogastric connector can serve as a feeding tube a compression device a leak detector and an anastomotic protection device. If there is a fault or leak the compression system is already in place and the anastomosis will be protected.

In some embodiments the transgastric fastening assemblies or other restriction devices serve to reduce the volume of the stomach or restrict the entry of food and in addition provide for electrical stimulation and or sensing furthermore the gain or the relationship between an input parameter e.g. a food bolus and an output parameter e.g. stimulation of the device can be assigned prior to implantation of the device and or can be adjusted after implantation of the device. In these embodiments an electrical signal runs through electrodes in the transgastric fastening assemblies enroute from a sensor or enroute to alter the contraction patterns of the stomach and or to electrically create a feeling of satiety through one or more afferent patient nervous pathways e.g. vagus nerve . Electrical stimulation can enhance or work synergistically with volume reduction and or the creation of a restriction to flow in the stomach. Thus the fastener assemblies and restriction devices of the present invention can serve as sensing and or stimulation structures which are useful for example in the creation of exogenous satiety feedback loops see below . In one embodiment a sensor is provided on an anchor connector extragastric balloon to detect the degree of buoyancy or flotation of the structure within the abdominal cavity.

In one embodiment an exogenous gastric feedback loop see is described a satiety feedback pathway is created surgically by implanting a transgastric fastening assembly wherein the connector is adapted to be a strain gauge or have a strain gauge as an integral component and the fastening assembly is further connected via a device efferent pathway to a patient afferent pathway such as the vagus nerve . Additional examples of patient afferent pathways include the parasympathetic or sympathetic nervous system which contain patient afferent satiety nerve fibers. In other embodiments the device afferent pathway strain gauge sensor communicates with a device end effector pathway. For example if the connector were produced from a shape memory alloy such as nitinol nickel titanium the connector could be induced to decrease in size generate extra tension when an electrical current heat passes through it. In other embodiments an electroactive polymer can be used as an actuator and or a sensor in this system. In some embodiments the strain gauge is located in proximity to the connector but is not the same device as the connector.

In one example when the strain gauge is activated e.g. by food passing through the stomach a message is transmitted to the connector at which point the connector contracts to thereby prevent the flow of food into the stomach. Alternatively or in addition to in another embodiment activation of the strain gauge transmits a signal to the device efferent pathway which in turn sends a signal to the patient afferent pathway .

In addition a gain controller can be provided on the device in one embodiment in order to adjust the relative action increase in connector tension or degree of stimulation of the vagus nerve related to the sensing parameter. This device configuration allows the device to apply tension only when necessary e.g. when food flows into the stomach . In some embodiments this device configuration can allow for minimal tension to be applied to the device except when required e.g. when food flows into the stomach . This configuration can save power may also lead to a decreased tendency for erosion of the devices and or may prevent associated complications with devices such as the Lap Band the complications of which include reflux. In one embodiment an electroactive polymer serves as a controllable actuator when a food bolus is sensed by the sensor the polymer is stimulated to change shape and therefore act as a flow restrictor. When the stimulation i.e. food bolus ends the voltage applied to the electroactive polymer is decreased thereby allowing food to enter the stomach once again. In this case there is only gastric restriction during food boluses.

In another embodiment of an exogenous satiety pathway a restricting band type device is placed around a portion of the stomach. As is well known to those in the art restricting bands typically contain a balloon contained within a rigid outer shell. An additional inventive feature is to endow the restricting device with the ability to sense circumferential tension or pressure such as for example would be created when food flows through the distal esophagus and proximal stomach or when a peristaltic wave approaches the restricting structure. Surgical restricting devices which circumscribe the gastroesophageal junction are well known in the art see for example U.S. Pat. No. 64 653 213 these surgical constricting devices can be further fitted with pressure or volume sensors e.g. a circumferential strain sensor in order to create device afferent pathways which respond to the feeding state and simulate via device efferent pathways patient end effector pathways e.g. gastric muscle device end effector pathways e.g. nitinol or electroactive polymer based bands patient afferent pathways such as the vagus nerve or other elements of the visceral nervous system e.g. sympathetic plexus . Sensor can also communicate directly with a device end effector pathway for example rather than a balloon the band can be produced from an electrically responsive material such as nickel titanium. In this embodiment the material and therefore the entire constricting band can be induced to contract when electricity is run through the material which generates heat to induce a shape change in the material in this case to generate an increase in tension . In this embodiment the tension of the band and therefore its restricting ability are controllable through the shape memory material. In other embodiments the restricting material is produced from an electroactive polymer which can respond to an electrical field.

In some embodiments the band also has a balloon which is adjusted by nickel titanium or by a magnetorheologic fluid for example which can also be used to fill the balloon portion of the band. After detecting a feeding state an electric current passes through the magnetorheologic fluid or through an electromagnet which allow the band to become firmer more viscous or less compliant and thereby more difficult for food to pass through the band. In states when the patient is not taking any food the fluid inside the balloon is soft and does not apply pressure to the stomach wall.

By detecting the flow of food through the region of the restriction device and inducing restriction electrically in these embodiments the stress on the stomach can be limited to predominantly the on time of the restricting device. This arrangement can limit the tendency for erosion exhibited by implantable devices and can also limit the power requirement for electrical stimulation or to change the diameter of the band. In other embodiments the device end effector pathways which adjust the restriction elements run in parallel with the sensor but are composed of separate materials. In some embodiments these devices are further equipped with gain control in which the relationship between the inputs and outputs can be modified. Such gain controls can further be modified externally with a wireless type transmitter.

Exogenously created satiety pathways can further contain a control system which can communicate externally through for example wireless transmitters for recording and gain adjustment. The control system can incorporate device afferent pathways integral sensor such as a strain gauge in one embodiment such that recording of pressure or volume changes in the distal esophagus pH in the stomach relative movement of the afferent sensor strain or stress on the transgastric connector or circumferential bands or relative movement of the fasteners of the transgastric fastening assembly can be fed to the control system . Furthermore the control system has controllable or programmable gains such that the response e.g. the patient afferent device afferent device efferent device end effector and patient end effector pathways to stimulation is increased or decreased. The gain control can occur with a wireless type transmitting device in some embodiments. Importantly the schematics of the control system in are only one depiction of many possible pathways of input and output flow. The various boxes lines sensors and actuators can be mixed and matched in any combination to provide a beneficial effect for a patient. Additional sensors and actuators can be added to the system as well. Some actuators may even be placed outside the abdomen to alert patients or physicians of patient behaviors.

In another embodiment a sensor device afferent pathway is implanted using the methods and devices described herein e.g. the connector fastener system and implantation tools described above and below the sensor can communicate with or be a component of the stimulator and or the restriction device. In one embodiment a sensor is placed in the stomach wall with or without a restricting structure and senses stretch in the stomach in another embodiment the sensor detects transgastric stress and strain or circumferential stress or strain. This sensor can communicate with the stimulator or restricting device to create a feedback loop in which stretch is sensed the sensor and then a signal is sent to the stimulator portion of the system e.g. the device efferent pathway wherein a nerve e.g. the patient afferent pathway for example the vagus nerve or sympathetic plexus is stimulated to prompt the patient to slow their intake of food. The end effecter patient end effector pathway of the feedback loop does not have to be a nervous structure and in some embodiments is a muscular portion of the stomach or duodenum such as the pyloric channel the antrum the cardia or the fundus. In some embodiments the patient end effecter pathway is a stimulus such as a small electrical current under the skin to inform the patient that the stomach is full and to stop food intake. In another embodiment the patient end effector is an audible alarm. In some embodiments the device end effector pathway is an actuator on the gastric band or near to the band and the end effector can have its power output automatically adjusted. In one embodiment a transgastric fastening assembly serves to reduce the volume of the stomach as well as provide for electrical stimulation. In this embodiment an electrical signal runs through electrodes in the transgastric fastener assembly to possibly alter the contraction patterns of the stomach or to electrically create a feeling of satiety in addition to reducing the volume of the stomach and creating a restriction to flow in the stomach. Thus fastener assemblies of the present invention can serve as electrodes which are useful for example for gastric electrical stimulation.

In one embodiment an exogenous satiety pathway is recreated surgically by implanting a transgastric fastening assembly wherein the connector is adapted to be a strain gauge. In this embodiment transgastric anchors serve as anchors and or stimulators and or sensors in addition to reducing volume or causing mechanical restriction. The fastening assembly is further connected via a device efferent pathway to a patient afferent pathway. Examples of patient afferent pathways include the parasympathetic or sympathetic nervous systems which contain patient afferent fibers which can induce satiety.

In another embodiment a satiety pathway is recreated surgically by placing a constricting device around a portion of the stomach where the constricting device is able to sense circumferential tension or pressure such as for example would be created when food flows through the distal esophagus and proximal stomach. Surgical constricting devices include devices such as the Lap Band transgastric anchor assemblies or the extragastric restricting devices e.g. a balloon discussed below. Any or all of these devices can also be placed around or near an anastomosis such as a Roux en Y anastomosis. depict a constricting device within an obesity treatment system. Sensor detects a stimulus the signal is interpreted by the device control system and the signal is delivered to a patient efferent device end effector for example further constriction of a nitinol based or electroactive polymer band or balloon device efferent and or patient end effector pathway.

In a surgically placed banding system is depicted around the proximal stomach . The band system comprises a rigid restricting structure and balloon which acts to restrict the flow of food into the stomach relative to the pressure in the balloon which initially is dependent on the volume of fluid in the balloon in this embodiment the balloon can be fitted with a sensor e.g. pressure sensor to provide information about feeding habits including frequency of meals volume of meals and consistency e.g. caloric intake . The pressure sensor can be incorporated into the fluid fillable balloon of constricting system . When food passes through the lumen of the restricting device the pressure increases inside the balloon signaling patient ingestion. The pressures sensor can detect changes in balloon pressure as a bolus of food passes through the constricting device system . Although one pressure sensor is used in one preferred embodiment in other embodiments one or more pressure sensors in strain or other sensors can be coupled to one another or directly to the balloon.

In one embodiment one or more pressure sensors are incorporated into the port of a laparoscopic band . The port communicates directly with the balloon. When fluid is introduced into the port by a surgeon the pressure in the balloon is measured in order to determine and set the volume of the balloon. In this embodiment pressure sensors communicate directly with the fluid chamber of the port and therefore communicate directly with the pressure in the balloon. Sensing pressure directly in the port can be advantageous because the balloon and or surgery does not have to be modified to add a pressure sensing to the treatment regime of the patient. Furthermore in patients whom already have a band in place the port because it is extra abdominal can be changed without having to worry about the balloon the intrabdominal portion therefore a band which is already in place can be outfitted to sense pressure via a relatively straightforward extra abdominal band change. Furthermore the port already in the marketplace can be retrofitted with pressure sensors a power supply and a telemetry without having to develop or change the balloon the Lap Band the patient already has in place. All of these sensing devices can further be adjusted changed or calibrated when the port is accessed percutaneously.

In one preferred embodiment a pressure sensor can be incorporated into the bottom portion of the port by cutting a hole in the port and placing the pressure sensor through the hole so that it is in fluid communication with the fluid inside the port. The sensor can further communicate with a transmitter e.g. a wireless transmitter and power supply. The power supply does not have to be implanted for example power can be delivered inductively and remotely to the pressure sensor through the skin. Furthermore the pressure sensor can communicate with an automated system which fills and or empties the port based on measurements from the pressure sensor.

In some embodiments pressure sensor is not a micromachined device but is made from a material which otherwise responds to strain stress or pressure change. For example an electroactive polymer is a device in which a capacitance is created by the polymer in between two electrodes. The capacitance is exquisitely sensitive to changes in pressure on one or both sides of the polymer. This type of polymer sensor system can possibly be manufactured from more naturally biocompatible materials than silicon.

Amplifier amplifies the signal generated by the piezoelectric polysilicon membrane in the pressure sensor. The amplified signal is then transmitted through the microcontroller system to the data logger which records time and voltage correlated with pressure from pressure sensor . The microcontroller converts the analogue signal from the amplifier to a digital signal for storage in the data logger . The microcontroller is powered on by the power source in response to a signal from the timer . It accepts power at every or 1 second interval depending on the program within the device. The microcontroller can be programmed to power up and sample pressure at even a faster rate though this frequency may not be necessary from the clinical standpoint. The microcontroller is powered on and off so that overall power in the circuit is conserved. For example with a duty cycle of 10 the power required for weekly data transmission and sensing at second intervals on a continuous basis allow the device to be powered for a year. In some embodiments the timer calls for power through the circuit at a lengthy interval e.g. 5 30 minutes and if the pressure is above a given threshold then the circuit senses and logs pressure every fraction of a second. In other embodiments the pressure is sampled at a constant rate. The sampling rates and other microcontroller variables can be controlled externally through the patient management system . Although components are shown independently in those skilled in the art would recognized that any or all of the data logger the timer the RF transmitter the amplifier and even the pressure sensor can all be condensed into one circuit.

In some embodiments port further comprises a visualizing material which enables visualization of the port under ultrasound guidance. Visualization material is one which provides contrast to the ultrasonic waves. Contrast is typically provided at fluid interfaces. Therefore material can be a polymer which contains a gas or a mixture of a gas and a liquid for example air and water . With enhanced visualization under ultrasound port can be accessed in locations which do not necessarily have fluoroscopic X ray capabilities such as a surgeon s office.

In some embodiments e.g. a hydraulic pump communicates with the adjustment port . The hydraulic pump in one embodiment can be manufactured with an electroactive polymer as the actuator. The pump communicates with a fluid reservoir . In the instance where the hydraulic pump is an electroactive polymer the pressure sensor can be a part of the electroactive polymer membrane and in this embodiment is the sensor and the actuator. The hydraulic pump can function autonomously to pump fluid into the port and then into the implant alternatively patient management system can be used to direct the hydraulic pump to fill the adjustment port to a given pressure. In one embodiment the hydraulic pump is utilized to change the buoyancy of the restriction device by injecting or removing air liquid foam inside the restriction device.

In other embodiments a pressure sensing system communicates with inflation tube from the implanted structure e.g. an adjustable stomach restricting band in a T configuration. In this embodiment port communicates with hydraulic line which splits off into a second hydraulic line which then communicates with a pressure sensing system . In this embodiment the pressure sensor is not rigidly coupled but is hydraulically connected in a flexible manner.

Although certain embodiments have described an implantable system the pressure sensing system can be a handheld system which communicates with a fluid line which then communicates with an implantable device . In some embodiments the handheld pressure sensing system for the implantable device can communicate hydraulically with the adjustment port through a fluid line percutaneously introduced with a needle through the skin. When pressure sensing system is handheld and external to the patient wireless data transmission is optional since data transmission could occur with an electrical cable leading to a patient. Pressure sensing system can contain the snout and isolating system described above or the pressure sensor can be made to be disposable such that it is included in manifold or is removable from the system itself. Inflator is a manually powered device to inflate the implantable restriction device while pressure is being measured via the pressure sensing system through the manifold .

In summary handheld device is part of a management system which includes the pressure sensors and retrofits described above. It may contain the pressure sensor snout isolator and diaphragm described above as well. This handheld system can sense the pressure in the band through the skin of a patient via percutaneous access via the manifold when the band is implanted in a patient. The patient can be given a food bolus or a water bolus and asked to swallow after which a pressure tracing will show up on a reader on the device . The reader can be at the patient s bedside e.g. as a component of device or the reader can be separated from the patient e.g. through a receiver on a PC in some embodiments a wireless transmitter is used. Connector transmits pressure from the manifold to the sensing system . Fluid line communicates with the implanted device through a needle introduced percutaneously through the skin of a patient.

In some embodiments sensor is not a pressure sensor but a temperature sensor pH sensor strain gauge camera etc. The pressure sensor is incorporated into obesity management system e.g. see in one embodiment obesity management system is an electronic control system which incorporates the pressure sensor and the output e.g. a stimulator . Output is any of the patient or device efferent or afferent outputs described above and below in one embodiment the output pathway is a stomach muscle stimulator which also stimulates vagal afferents and or vagal efferent pathways. Required but not shown is a source of power which as is well known in the art is required for operation of the system and can be delivered remotely or through an integral power supply.

In another embodiment of the current invention a neurostimulator or neurostimulator lead is a component of the restriction or volume reducing device but does not have to be an integral component for example it can be distal in the stomach yet communicate with the restricting device and is placed in the serosal layer of the stomach or small intestine to stimulate the muscular or nervous portion of the stomach or small intestine e.g. the duodenum . In some embodiments the stimulator contacts and acts on the parasympathetic the enteric or the sympathetic nervous system in other embodiments the stimulator acts on the muscular portion of the stomach. The stimulator can be placed anywhere along the stomach including the anterior and or posterior walls of the stomach. In some embodiments the stimulator contacts the mucosa and in other embodiments the stimulator does not contact the mucosa. In some embodiments a sensor is placed as a component of the stimulator or as a separate device. In some embodiments the stimulator further communicates with a second or third stimulator through a wired or wireless connection.

A further component of the system is the ability of the system to detect store and transmit sensory and motor information from the effector pathways and that is pathways and can sense currents e.g. from the stomach vagus enteric or sympathetic nerves as well as provide therapeutic electrical current. The ability to sense the currents can be used to optimize the therapeutic electrical currents or enable understanding of the patient s behavior. This information includes voltages amplitudes and waveforms from neural pathways such as the parasympathetic sympathetic gastric muscle and enteric nervous pathways. When interpreted in relation to patient ingestion and type of ingestion these signals can be used to further understand satiety signals generated in reponse to ingestion. In this manner the system can essentially learn from itself and be optimized for each patient.

In another embodiment an extragastric balloon is used to reduce the volume of the stomach and or create a barrier to the flow of food and a restrictor to the flow of food. Although balloon is used in the description below any device which expands from a contracted state to a deployed state can be used. depicts the balloon or other expandable device in the undeployed configuration. The balloon is placed through a trocar port after the trocar port has been placed between the peritoneum and the anterior wall of the stomach with or without general pneumoperitoneum as described in detail above and below. shows an embodiment of an extragastric balloon in its deployed state. The balloon is attached to the abdominal wall by any of the percutaneous anchor connector assemblies and methods described above. Stem is the residual from the connector used to place the balloon with an optional access port valve for further inflation and or deflation after the balloon is placed for example a surgeon can access the subcutaneous port using a needle placed through the skin. The access port can further be retrofitted with a pressure sensor to detect the pressure exerted by the balloon on the stomach wall . A pressure sensor or other force transducer e.g. a strain transducer can also be placed in or around the balloon itself. Anchor is similar to the anterior anchors described above and can be placed between the muscular portion of the abdominal wall and the subcutaneous fat or between the anterior layer of muscular fascia and the muscle e.g. the rectus muscle . In some embodiments the balloon is placed close to the pylorus or at the fundus of the stomach close to the GE junction and can optionally be contoured to partially or completely surround the GE junction or the pyloric outlet. In some embodiments the posterior portion of the balloon is fixed to the outer or inner portion of the stomach using any of the fastening systems described above two or more point fixation for example the balloon can be delivered over a connector a guidewire or a rail to its position inside the abdomen. The balloon can be delivered within a port The balloon can further be combined with a transgastric anchor assembly to aid its attachment to adjustably control tension on the transgastric assembly or to synergize with the transgastric anchor assembly. The posterior portion of the balloon can be fixed to the anterior gastric wall with an anchor delivered through the stomach with an endoscope. The balloon structure can be used in combination with a VBG a Ruox en Y or any other surgical procedure.

In one embodiment an anchor is used to fix the extragastric balloon to the stomach using an endoscope in combination with a guidewire guidewires are thin flexible wires which are well known in the cardiology and gastroenterology fields which is also placed through the endoscope. In some embodiments guidewires are used through laparoscopic trocars or directly through incisions in the skin of the abdominal wall in some embodiments guidewires are similar to the connectors discussed above. In some embodiments the balloon is attached to fixation points other than the abdominal wall and stomach wall . For example the balloon can be attached to the diaphragm the liver the colon or the omentum. In some embodiments an expandable device other than a balloon is used. For example the expandable device can be an expandable cage which expands based on pre stressed metal or polymer which then returns to its pre determined shape.

The extragastric balloon can be placed anywhere along the stomach even at a position 1 5 cm below the gastroesophageal junction at the same place where laparoscopically placed adjustable gastric bands are currently placed. The balloon can further be shaped to partially circumscribe or form a lumen fully circumscribe around a structure such as the gastroesophageal junction. The balloon can have roughened regions to improve friction and or adhesion with the stomach. The balloon can further have support structures either separate materials or components of the same material with different mechanical properties which are rigid or more rigid than the balloon and in some embodiments help to apply force toward the stomach.

Even though the balloon may completely circumscribe the stomach it does not necessarily have to be a continuous ring and can be discontinuous even though it forms a complete ring when fully expanded. For example depicts an expanding device e.g. a balloon which does not form a complete lumen around the region of the stomach. The device can circumscribe up to approximately one quarter of the circumference of the stomach or from one quarter to one half the circumference of the stomach or even one half to three quarters the circumference of the stomach. Support structure can circumscribe a similar circumference or can circumscribe its own circumference of the stomach.

In one embodiment device is not an expanding device but is made from a material which tends to contract passively or actively. For example device can be made from a material such nitinol which starts at a first width and tends to move toward a smaller width unless a force is applied to prevent contraction of the width. If the device in this embodiment were designed for a region of the stomach 1 5 cm below the GE junction the device may begin at a width of from 5 10 cm then contracting to a width of between 0.5 cm and 4 cm. In another embodiment it is supporting material which is produced from a material that tends to contract passively or actively. Supporting material in this embodiment can be produced from a material such as nitinol which creates rigidity along one portion of the expandable device or itself is adjustable for example structure can be a fluid fillable balloon as well essentially creating a multi compartment fluid fillable structure. Support material can also be placed inside of the expanding device an expanding device inside an expanding device or an inflateable device inside an inflateable device. The inner expandable device can provide support for the outer supporting device or the inner device can be used to increase or decrease the overall density or buoyancy of the device.

Alternative materials for this embodiment include a variety of electroactive polymers and materials. Any of the sensors actuators and systems described above and below can be incorporated into this embodiment as well.

In one embodiment a material configured as a mesh can be placed within 1 5 cm from around the GE junction of the stomach alternatively the device can be placed along the length of the stomach or at the region of the pyloric valve. The mesh can be made from materials such as nitinol an electroactive polymer see for example U.S. Pat. No. 6 940 211 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety and or other materials which possess shape memory and or can be actively shape controlled to apply pressure to the stomach and create a restriction to the flow of food through the stomach. Mesh can be made from any of the biocompatible materials above and or below and additionally can be produced from a composite material .

The material which can be referred to as an anchoring frame anchoring structure anchoring material anchoring tab or anchoring body can be placed at any part of an implantation procedure. For example the material can be placed prior to implantation of the anchor inserting the frame initially and then attaching the anchor afterward using a suture or a connector. The anchoring frame can also be placed into the abdomen and attached to the abdominal wall a restriction device subsequently attached to the frame.

The extragastric balloons and or other devices can further be configured to act as stimulators which can deliver electrical current or can sense certain parameters such as peristaltic contraction food boluses or other patient activity. Electroactive polymers and shape memory alloys can also be used as sensors and or actuators. In one example an electroactive polymer consists of multiple polymer layers wherein one or more of the layers comprises a sensor such as a strain gauge or pressure gauge. This information can be used to increase or decrease the volume of the balloon accordingly.

As described above any of the extragastric balloon embodiments can further contain an integral sensor to detect changes in volume for example volume and or pressure changes of the restricted portion of the stomach. Such changes in volume can then be used to create satiety feedback loops to deter the patient from further food intake as discussed above and below for example vagal nerve stimulation .

In some embodiments mechanical fixation structures are used to attach the balloon to the serosa of the stomach. Other means of attaching balloons to the stomach include adhesives pledgets expandable anchors etc. The connector anchor systems above are used to attach the balloon to the abdominal wall. The connector can further serve as an inflation valve for the extragastric balloon.

In another embodiment a flexible guiding device e.g. a connector is depicted as part of a system to operate or place devices in or around the stomach. Device is placed through lumen of device . Device can be expandable in some embodiments. In one embodiment anchor is first implanted in the stomach after a trocar and or camera is are optionally placed in between the abdominal wall and the stomach. The anchor could be a temporary anchor or could be a grasper which temporarily grabs onto the stomach while devices are implanted over the guiding devices connectors . Anchor or grasper can first grasp structures other than the stomach including the diaphragm the liver the omentum a nervous structure or the crus of the diaphragm.

A device such as a camera can optionally be placed close to the anchoring device . This camera can be flexible and of a CCD or CMOS type. The camera is slideable along the guiding device and can be used to direct placement of the device or used to direct the injection of materials or to visualize the application of energy to the stomach wall or related nervous structure. The guiding device allows for positioning and fixturing inside the abdominal cavity. The guiding device can purely serve to guide devices to the stomach or it can ultimately serve to conduct electrical or mechanical power to the expanding device or other surgical devices such as electrocautery devices retractors e.g. liver retractor graspers or scissors.

Extragastric constriction systems can be particularly advantageous in patients who have had bariatric procedures in the past e.g. Roux en Y Vertical Banded Gastroplasty or a duodenal switch . Patients who have had these procedures have anatomy posterior to their stomachs which is typically scarred and difficult to access. Therefore a device which applied pressure from the top or sides would be advantageous in this patient population as access would be achieved through percutaneous means and possibly percutaneous surgery and would not involve encircling the stomach. The assumption is that compression from on top of the stomach is counteracted by the relative stability of the retroperitoneum behind the stomach. This assumption is proven in the animal experimentation described below.

In some embodiments extragastric expanding devices are combined with transgastric anchors . In these embodiments transgastric restriction devices have an extragastric balloon to adjust stoma passageway for food through the device size. Balloons can be placed on either side of the stomach. Balloons can be sensors or stimulators as can band or .

To provide experimental verification of the assumption that the one sided balloon can provide for functional stomach restriction a prototype of this assembly was placed in a porcine abdomen and fixed in its operative position according to the method described above and depicted in . The device was attached to the crus of the diaphragm and attached to the anterior wall of the stomach using floating serosal knots which did not pierce the wall of the stomach in accordance with . A gastrograffin swallow was performed one month later. With filling of 0 50 cc the balloon exerted minimal force on the esophagus during the bolus of fluid. After the balloon was filled with up to 100 cc or more of saline it was evident that the extragastric balloon indeed created a physiologic level of stomach restriction. depicts some of these results in the form of a schematic of a picture obtained from a fluoroscopy performed during the procedure. The animal was given a gastrograffin radiocontrast meal and fluoroscopy performed. As can be seen at the 100 cc level of contrast swallowed the balloon constricted the stomach enough to practically prevent all flow into the stomach from the esophagus . The extragastric balloon was also filled with contrast material to evaluate its position relative to the esophagus and stomach . Thus it is evident that one sided restriction or non circumferential restriction or an extragastric balloon indeed can indeed utilize the retroperitoneal region behind the stomach to create enough pressure on food entering the stomach to create a back pressure within the esophagus and therefore induce satiety.

In accordance with these experimental data a method is described whereby an extragastric balloon pushes on the stomach pushing the posterior portion of the stomach against the retroperitoneum thereby compressing the stomach walls together to create a resistance to food entering the stomach to create a sensation of fullness.

The procedure performed to evaluate the extragastric inflateable implant in the animal experiment is also useful in the clinic when treating human patients. For example in one method of treating a patient the extragastric balloon is implanted in proximity to the stomach and filled with fluid. In one embodiment it is preferable to fill the balloon with radiocontrast saline so that it is visible under fluoroscopy and during follow up of the patient. In one embodiment the balloon is filled with a small amount of fluid so that it can heel into place forming a capsule around it and assisting in its anchoring to the stomach wall. After 15 30 days the balloon can then be inflated to the proper volume and level of stomach restriction. The balloon can be filled with a water soluble contrast agent such as gastrograffin so that the balloon will be visible at follow up clinic visits.

At explantation of the balloon in the experimental validation described above the assembly was found to be adhered in place with a thin capsule around it. At explantation the volume within the assembly was adjustable so that a large resistance was created at the entry to the stomach creating a barrier to food entry into the stomach. Indeed at high enough levels for example 100 cc an enlarged esophagus was found to have been created a so called mega esophagus indicating that a single sided balloon can indeed create a back pressure within the stomach using the immobile retroperitoneum to provide the resistive force behind the stomach.

In the clinical environment an extragstric assembly can therefore be used to prevent or limit the amount of food ingested by a patient. The device can be filled with barium or gastrografin during implantation and the effect on the esophagus can be used to determine the amount of volume utilized within the balloon to create satiety by viewing its effect on the esophagus. Alternatively a nasogastric manometer can be utilized to detect the back pressure on the esophagus and indicate the need for tightening or loosening of the restriction device prior to setting its final configuration prior to the end of surgery.

The ingestion signals can also be used to couple to a therapeutic or behavioral change in a patient. For example the ingestion signal can be used to trigger a stimulator such as a muscle stimulator a nervous stimulator a cutaneous stimulator etc. as described above. Alternatively the ingestion signal can be used as an external auditory signal to remind a patient of a diet.

In accordance with the data obtained related to the pressure sensing apparatus a pressure sensor can be implanted into a patient at the time of implantation of a restriction device. After implantation and healing of the device in place the gain of the device can be adjusted so that a signal noise ratio is obtained wherein the pressure sensor detects physiologically relevant signals related to food ingestion. The physiologically relevant signals can then be utilized by a physician to adjust the restriction device in order to optimize therapy with the restriction device.

Surgical instruments which can be used to implant many of the devices of this invention are disclosed. The surgical instruments represent one example of the methods to implant the disclosed devices but not the only possible means for implantation. Any of the devices and or methods and or features of the current inventions can be implanted with an endoscopic procedure in addition to endoscopic means to assist a percutaneous procedure or an endoscopic means to assist a laparoscopic procedure.

The distal end of the grasping instrument is configured to cut puncture or dilate tissue when the jaws are in the closed position. In one embodiment shown in the jaws have screw thread shaped protrusions on the surface. By rotating the instrument as it passes through tissue the protrusions facilitate the penetration of tissue similar to a corkscrew. In another embodiment illustrated in the instrument has jaws that form a sharp tip when closed. In yet another embodiment the jaws form a blade which can cut through tissues when in the closed position. One of skill in the art would recognize that the above configurations can be combined or that other configurations are possible which facilitate the passage of the tip of the instrument through the wall of the stomach or other tissue.

It also should be realized to one skilled in the art that the closed end of the grasping device does not have to be the only instrument responsible for cutting through the tissue the central lumen of the device can be utilized to assist in tissue penetration. For example a needle e.g. a Veres needle can be passed through the lumen and the needle can make the initial puncture through the tissue. The configuration of the distal end of the grasper is meant to be a tissue dilator and facilitator of the entry into the stomach or any other hollow organ after the needle makes the initial puncture. For safety the needle can be retracted as the tissue grasper dilates the tissue.

In the embodiment of the tissue grasper illustrated in the inner member and outer sleeve have a central tunnel that extends the length of the tissue grasper. The tunnel allows for the passage of an expanding means such as a needle or other instrument or device such as the posterior or anterior anchor described above see for example the description above regarding the connector suture combination in which the suture is left behind and the outer sheath of the connector is pulled away through the length of the tissue grasper as shown in . The central tunnel is also adapted such that a radially dilating sheath can be inserted through it. The diameter of the central lumen is preferably at least 4 mm but can be at least 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 or 12 mm. In an alternative embodiment the distal jaws can be configured to close through an electromechanical means a purely magnetic means or via an electroactive polymer such that the inner member is not necessary.

The tubular middle sleeve of the anchor grasping instrument has a portion of a handle attached at the proximal end of the instrument. Disposed within the middle sleeve is a tubular inner member which has an outer diameter such that it can slide within the middle sleeve in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the middle sleeve but cannot move substantially in transverse to the longitudinal axis of the middle sleeve . At the proximal end of the inner member a second portion of a handle is attached.

The distal tip of the instrument is illustrated in more detail in with the inclusion of the anterior anchor of and connector of . is a side section view taken along the line C C of . At the distal end of the inner member is a pair of hooking members which are connected to the inner member at a hinge point . When the distal end of the inner member is displaced from the inside of the middle sleeve such that the hinge point is outside the middle sleeve the hooking members assume their open position as depicted in . As the hinge point is withdrawn into the middle sleeve the middle sleeve forces the hooking members into a closed position as illustrated in . The opening and closing of the hooking members can be accomplished by manipulation of the handle portions and .

The instrument is designed such that the anterior anchor is easily manipulated. When the anterior anchor is in its substantially folded or compressed configuration as in the entire anterior anchor assembly can be manipulated along the longitudinal axis of the connector . depicts the assembly as it would be introduced over the connector and into the patient. The operator pulls the connector toward the operator such that the posterior anchor is urged toward the anterior anchor. When in position the operator deploys anterior anchor . To deploy anterior anchor outer sheath is pulled back toward the operator. Middle sleeve is then withdrawn proximally toward the operator as well. Hooking members tend to fan out as the middle sleeve is pulled back and will release hooks . Once deployed anterior anchor is now fixed in a longitudinal position along the connector .

An important feature of the anterior anchor in some embodiments is that it be grippable by a laparoscopic grasping instrument and able to be translated through a laparoscopic port further the anterior anchor is reversibly translatable along the connector such that the surgeon can place and replace depending on what is seen by the endoscopist or the tension indicated by the tensiometers. If the surgeon wants to re adjust the anterior anchor connector is manipulated so that the hooks of the anterior anchor are brought into contact with hooking members middle sleeve is advanced distally from the operator permitting hooking members to engage the hooks such contact is facilitated by pulling back proximally on the connector . By manipulating the middle sleeve over the hooking members the hooks on the ends of the hooking members can engage the hooks on the anterior anchor . The outer sheath is then slid over the anterior anchor or the anchor middle sleeve complex is withdrawn into the outer sheath until it is compressed into an undeployed configuration as shown in . As described above when the anterior anchor is in a substantially compressed configuration it can move along the length of the connector in either direction.

In an embodiment where an inflatable anterior anchor such as the one illustrated in is utilized or in the case that the anterior anchor is otherwise sufficiently compliant to be pushed through a laparoscopic port a standard laparoscopic grasping instrument with teeth can be used to manipulate the anterior anchor. When the inflatable anterior anchor is in the uninflated position it is sufficiently compliant such that it can easily be passed through a laparoscopic port prior to inflation and deployment or after it has been deflated for readjustment the middle sheath may not be necessary because the compliance of the balloon enables easy compression into the outer sheath. The inflation tube passes through the laparoscopic port and out of the patient. This allows the inflation tube of the anchor to be temporarily opened or closed outside the patient allowing for deflation and reinflation until the anchor is in place. The inflation tube is then sealed and cut off preferably substantially flush to the surface of the anterior anchor. Clearly one skilled in the art will understand that this instrument can be used for extra gastric balloons or balloons attached to the abdominal wall or inside the abdominal wall.

A particularly advantageous laparoscopic port is one which allows visualization with a laparoscope of the individual abdominal layers as the laparoscope is being pushed through the abdominal wall well known to those skilled in the art . Use of such a port allows the surgeon to see the different layers of the abdominal wall from within the trocar using a standard laparoscopic camera as the trocar is advanced through the abdominal wall. The endoscopic light inside the stomach will be seen by the surgeon as the port approaches the inner layers of the abdominal wall because the endoscopic light source transilluminates through the layers of the stomach wall and inner layers of the abdominal wall. Such visualization is advantageous if the patient has a very thick abdominal wall e.g. in a morbidly obese patient because the surgeon needs to ensure that another organ e.g. the colon is not positioned between the stomach and the posterior wall of the abdomen. Once the transillumination of the stomach is visible through the transparent port the port can be slipped in the abdomen between the abdominal wall and the anterior wall of the stomach. This portion of the procedure may be done without pneumoperitoneum and without general anesthesia e.g. local anesthesia .

At this point the camera can also be used to visualize the anterior wall of the stomach and or it can be used to visualize placement of devices into the anterior wall of the stomach examples of some devices include stimulators sutures clips drug delivery devices sensors and volume displacing devices extragastric balloons are discussed below . As described above visualization of the surface of the stomach and implantation of devices into the anterior wall without puncturing through the stomach can be achieved with this method and does not require general pneumoperitoneum. The camera can be slid along the stomach to reach virtually any portion of the anterior stomach duodenal wall or lower esophagus. Additional ports can also be placed in the space between the abdominal wall and the anterior wall of the stomach. With the additional ports additional instruments can be used which can facilitate placement of the devices into the walls of the stomach. Suture passers knot tiers electrosurgical devices and clip appliers are just some examples of instruments which already exist in the surgical arts and which can be utilized to facilitate placement of devices into the walls of the stomach. Small incisions can be made in the serosa of the stomach and a pocket can be made so that stimulators can be placed in a pouch in the stomach wall. Therefore using the inventive technique of entering the abdomen without general anesthesia and without pneumoperitoneum as detailed above many different gastric operations can be performed.

In a method for percutaneous gastric surgery is illustrated also see for the associated devices . Percutaneous gastric surgery begins with at least one skin incision after which a surgical device such as a connector rigid or flexible is pushed through the skin and abdominal wall to enter the space between the stomach and the abdominal wall . Abdominal structure s is are contacted with one or more flexible or rigid connector device s . Temporary graspers and or anchors can also be used to contact structures within the abdomen such as the stomach liver omentum and the diaphragm some of these temporary devices can be used to retract the liver for example by sliding a retractor over the flexible connector to for example push the liver away from the stomach while surgery is being performed on the stomach. Once the abdominal structure is contacted or grasped with the flexible or rigid connector device s a surgical device can optionally slide over the flexible connector s to perform surgery on the stomach examples of surgical devices include electrosurgical hooks organ retractors graspers and knot tiers. Spaces or grooves can be made with these devices on either side of stomach or GE junction. Once these spaces and or grooves are made on either side of the stomach other devices can be slid over the connector to perform procedures visualize a region or implant devices in the stomach. Examples of devices and procedures include stimulators balloons ablation of nervous tissue fundoplications and injection of bulking agents to treat reflux disease for example . In some embodiments the temporary grasper serves as an anchor and the connector becomes the outside communication path for a device such as an extragastric balloon see below .

At this point in the procedure or any other point a therapeutic energy device can also be applied to the stomach. For example a laser or other phototherapy device a radiofrequency device a microwave device or an ultrasound device can be applied to the stomach. Furthermore electrical and or nervous mapping can be performed with the surgical device in a position between the anterior wall of the stomach and the abdominal wall. In the embodiment where an extragastric balloon is being deployed see above and below such deployment can proceed at this step. The ability to perform these procedures without general pneumoperitoneum and with minimal anesthesia is enabled by the inventive methods described herein and is considered advantageous. Furthermore in the embodiment where balloons are placed inside the stomach or neuro or muscular stimulators or other devices are placed in the walls of the stomach these devices are implanted at this step and do not require pneumoperitoneum or general anesthesia.

At this point in the percutaneous procedure after entry into the stomach the tissue grasping instruments of is inserted through the port with the jaws in the closed position with or without a needle projecting in front of the instrument and is passed through the anterior wall of the stomach . When the jaws of the instrument are closed the jaws define a sharp dilating and or cutting configuration which can more easily advance through the stomach wall.

In an alternative embodiment the space of the lesser peritoneal sac is not expanded before the posterior anchor is placed. For example in an embodiment where an inflatable posterior anchor is used the potential space can be expanded by the anchor itself as it is inflated to its deployed configuration.

In another embodiment the posterior anchor is directly implanted in the retroperitoneum rather than in the lesser peritoneal sac. In this embodiment the posterior anchor is placed in the retroperitoneum above the envelope of the lesser peritoneal sac. Above the envelope the retroperitoneum is safe being above the pancreas and splenic vessels. As is known to those skilled in the art of bariatric surgery the Lap Band is implanted at this spot in the retroperitoneum however implantation requires general anesthesia and pneumoperitoneum . A Cat Scan MRI fluoroscopy or ultrasound can be used to assist in this step.

In the laparoscopic procedure after insufflation pneumoperitoneum and general anesthesia of the abdominal cavity with a Veres needle a retrogastric tunnel is created as is well known in the surgical arts and is shown in . The posterior anchors are shown as a component of the retrogastric instrument in . Embodiments of the posterior anchors are also shown in . Depicted are single posterior anchors with one or more connectors and continuous posterior anchors with one or more connectors. The suture connector system depicted in is also depicted in and can be used in one of the laparoscopic embodiments. Connector in engages anchor and locks suture into posterior anchor . Connector is then slid over suture prior to the anterior anchor similar to the anterior anchor in being slid over tracking the connector . depicts the configuration of the transgastric anchor assemblies after the anterior anchors are placed tensioned and the connectors are cut. depicts devices of the laparoscopic procedure where the posterior anchor is continuous. Anterior anchors are shown as individual anchors and as discs however in some embodiments the anterior anchors can be rectangular or continuous.

In some embodiments a suture is provided on the posterior anchor not shown prior to insertion of the connector connector is adapted to pull the suture through the stomach and thence through the abdominal wall after being inserted through the anterior and posterior wall of the stomach. This results in a configuration similar to . Subsequent attachment of the anterior fastener s and subsequent urging step where the anterior and posterior walls are brought together is similar as outlined above.

When the connector reaches the posterior anchor gripping elements are released by the surgeon through a mechanism which is integrated into the laparoscopic tool . Connector is fixed to posterior anchor through a locking mechanism. Mechanisms of locking connector to posterior anchor are well known to those skilled in the art of mechanical fixturing. Some or all of the fixturing mechanisms may reside on the connector or on the anchor. In another embodiment the gripping force of the grippers can be overcome by force applied by the surgeon on connector . Reversible locking means other than mechanical means also exist and include magnetic electromagnetic and adhesive means.

An anterior anchor is then placed over the connector by the methodology and devices described in the next paragraph the mechanism of deploying the anterior anchor is the same in both the laparoscopic and percutaneous procedures. The walls of the stomach are urged together to create a resistance to the flow of food within the stomach or to reduce the volume of the stomach. Stomach region depicts one side of the stomach after the walls of the stomach are urged together. Region is the side of the stomach where the food enters. Its the stomach volume and capacity are now reduced as compared to its original volume and capacity. Although not shown connector is subsequently truncated at the level of the anterior anchor after the anterior anchor is deployed by any of the mechanisms described and depicted above. depicts the transgastric assembly after the anterior anchor is deployed. depicts a cutting tool which is threaded over the connector and allow cutting of the connector after deployment of the anterior anchor.

In a preferred embodiment the inflatable anterior anchor of is used and the use of the implantation instrument of is optional. After the anterior anchor is in the desired position the anterior anchor is inflated with a filling substance through the inflation tube until it is in its deployed configuration. The gripping elements and teeth are thus engaged against the connector in . The anchor implantation device can then be withdrawn from the patient s abdomen.

In another embodiment both the posterior anchor and the anterior anchor are continuous along both the anterior and posterior portions of the stomach. In this embodiment connectors are suture like or are more rigid as described above. Strain gauges or flexible electrodes may be incorporated into any or all of the connectors . Region is the where food flows through the restriction system. In some embodiments it is desirable to transect a part of the stomach with staplers well known in the surgical arts creating a region between the staple lines.

In some embodiments a fluid expandable component is included in the laparoscopically placed anchors . the fluid expandable component combines the best of the banding procedures and the surgical procedures such as the VBG.

With the transgastric fastening assembly complete the surgeon can examine the resulting configuration of the stomach using an endoscope. If one or more anterior anchors is are not in the desired location its placement along the connector can be adjusted as described above. Alternatively in another embodiment the anterior anchor can be urged closer to the posterior anchor simply by pushing it along the connector without using the implantation device to capture the anchor and deform it into its reduced profile configuration.

In another embodiment the anterior anchor can be deflated allowing the anterior anchor to be repositioned the anterior anchor is reversibly fixed to the connector and then reinflated to engage the connector. illustrates the transgastric fastening assembly with the anterior anchor in its deployed configuration on the connector and the anchor implantation instrument removed from the patient s abdomen. The anterior and posterior walls of the stomach have been urged closer together by the transgastric fastening assembly. Whether the walls of the stomach are urged into contact or not is determined by the surgeon. Contact between the mucosal surfaces can be loose such that food can go through yet a significant resistance to food is provided alternatively mucosal surfaces are urged together and touch however food cannot pass through the apposed surfaces.

When more than one transgastric fastening assembly is to be implanted it is sometimes preferred to insert all of the posterior anchors and connectors before attaching any or all anterior anchors. For example in posterior anchors are show in a position posterior to the stomach with connectors outside the abdomen. Anterior anchors can now be placed over the connectors and the tension independently adjusted under endoscopic visualization. In some embodiments an instrument to measure and quantify tension is used to measure the compression of the stomach mucosa prior to the operation. In some embodiments test blocks are placed on the laparoscopic ports . The tension on connectors can now be tested without placing an anterior fastener on the connector. This type of parallel fastener placement and quantification allows the operator to control the tension of each individual fastener across a row of fasteners. Test blocks are adapted to engage connectors and the optimal tension on the connectors can be quantified using a standard tensiometer attached to connectors . The degree of volume reduction can also be tested with this setup and by visualization with endoscope . Once the optimal tension has been determined the anterior fastener is placed over the connector at the pre determined tension. Tensioning of individual fasteners is in contrast to attempting place transgastric fastening assemblies in series. While possible to individually place transgastric assemblies in series if one were to do so each successive assembly would be more difficult to place because the volume of the stomach would be progressively reduced resulting in more difficult visualization each time.

In an alternative embodiment the stomach is fastened to the abdominal wall rather than there being a free space between the anterior gastric wall and the peritoneum of the abdominal wall not shown . The initial steps are as discussed above. After the posterior anchors are placed their position can be tested as depicted in to simulate the configuration after the anterior anchor is placed. Next the outer laparoscopic port is pulled back so that the anchor deploying instrument directly contacts and sits within the tissues of the muscular abdominal wall. Once the outer laparoscopic port is pulled back the anterior anchor can be deployed within the abdominal wall musculature and the connector can be cut flush with the anterior anchor. In an embodiment where the inflatable anterior anchor is used after the anterior anchor is deployed within the abdominal wall musculature the inflation tube is cut preferably flush with the anterior anchor.

The connector e.g. a suture of a preferred embodiment of the deployed transgastric fastening assembly as illustrated in can be cut at a point between the anterior and posterior anchors which results in reversal of the gastric volume reduction. The connector is preferably made to resist corrosion from stomach acid but is able to be cut by a cutting implement advanced through an endoscope into the stomach. In the Smith paper Smith L. et. al. Results and Complications of Gastric Partitioning. The American Journal of Surgery. Vol. 146 December 1983 a nylon suture was used to traverse the stomach in the anterior posterior direction and attach the pledgets to the walls of the stomach. The nylon material was suitable for use for over 3 years without any indication of corrosion. Other materials suitable to prevent corrosion and yet allow cutting include plastics such as polyurethane silicone elastomer polypropylene PTFE PVDF or polyester metals and metal alloys such as stainless steel nickel titanium titanium cobalt chromium etc. Once the connector is cut the walls of the stomach are free to move away from one another thereby reversing the procedure. Reversal of the procedure can occur at any time days to years after the procedure. In a preferred embodiment the anchors remain in the gastric wall permanently even after the connector is cut or otherwise divided the anchors are made from a material which facilitates permanent integration into the gastric wall or other intestinal wall suitable materials include polypropylene Alloderm Surgisis and polyesters. Alternatively in other embodiments the anchors can in part or in whole be manufactured from a bioabsorbable material such that the anchors will eventually be absorbed by the body. In the case of bioabsorbable anchors it is preferable to have a connector which is at least in part bioabsorbable. In another embodiment substantially all of the elements of the transgastric fastening assembly are made of bioabsorbable materials with the intent that over the desired period of time the entire assembly will be absorbed by the body reversing the procedure without any additional actions required by a doctor. In another embodiment the anchors are made of a non reactive material such as silicone. In this embodiment reversal of the procedure requires a laparoscopic procedure that is pneumoperitoneum so that the connectors can be cut and the fasteners removed. The connector is cut with the endoscope and then the anchors are removed with standard laparoscopic instrumentation being composed of silicone the anchors in this case will be easily removed.

Even if there is some degree of fusion between the mucosa around the connector at the region of the assembly once the connector is cut or absorbed the walls will tend to move apart over time. Alternatively a balloon or other dissection device is introduced through an endoscope and used to urge apart the walls of the stomach at the point of fusion.

The devices methods and instruments disclosed above and below can be used to treat other diseases such as gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD . In this embodiment a transgastric fastening assembly is placed in the cardia region. Such a configuration would maintain the position of the GE junction in the abdomen and potentially create a barrier to reflux contents. Similar to the devices above feedback systems can be instituted so that the reflux prevention is initiated as a response to a stimulus such as pH or peristalsis rather than applying continuous pressure to the tissue even when reflux is not present. Furthermore GERD devices can be equipped with patient controlled features such that when the patient feels symptoms the antireflux features are activated. Reflux disease can also be treated with sutures or plications placed with a percutaneous procedure and in the region of the GE junction. Placement of the sutures with or without pledgets with a percutaneous procedure would not require general anesthesia and would be advantageous in many patients.

In many of the embodiments discussed above a transverse row of fasteners is depicted which is one method of creating volume reduction or flow restriction. depicts and alternative embodiment in which three transgastric fastening assemblies are deployed longitudinally in the stomach such a configuration of anchors results in a tubular configuration of the remaining portion of the stomach. The dashed lines represent boundaries of the divisions of the stomach the cardia of the stomach the fundus of the stomach the body of the stomach the antrum of the stomach and the pyloric sphincter . In one embodiment the fastening assemblies are not implanted in the antrum but are implanted longitudinally in the stomach as shown in in order to maintain the normal digestion process of the stomach. Normal digestion therefore occurs in the antrum which precedes passage of food into the duodenum. In stopping short of the antrum the implants replicate the degree of volume reduction of the Magenstrasse and Mill M M procedure discussed above in the background .

Food ingested by the patient follows a physiologic pathway for digestion depicted by the arrow in . It travels through the esophagus and enters the cardia of the stomach . The food is digested in the stomach and pushed toward the duodenum as chyme for further digestion. The preserved antrum allows for relatively physiologic digestion and emptying into the duodenum akin to the M M procedure. With transgastric fastening assemblies in place food which leaves the esophagus and enters the stomach results in increased wall tension on the lesser curvature of the stomach as the greater curvature of the stomach will be restricted from the food pathway. The path of least resistance will be the path toward the pylorus and duodenum . The increased wall tension of the stomach will result in a feeling of satiety by the patient leading to decreased food intake and weight loss. As discussed further above any of the transgastric assemblies in this embodiment can have feedback systems which communicate with patient end effector patient afferent pathways device efferent and or device afferent pathways. Although three assemblies are shown in there may be as few as one or as many as ten or more depending on the degree of volume reduction desired. Such flexibility in number of devices as well as the ability of the surgeon to tune the tension between the anterior and posterior anchors is advantageous. Such flexibility may enable for example reversal of a few anchors rather than all the anchors such that the volume reduction procedure is partially reversed. As described above any or all of the anchors or parts of the anchors can be biodegradable and therefore the gastric reduction procedure would be reversible by virtue of the implanted biodegradable anchors. Furthermore in some embodiments where there are multiple transgastric connectors which are produced from an electrically active material different ones of the multiple connectors can be adjusted. In some embodiments an electrical current is applied to the structures in order to reverse the procedure. For example some metals and polymers will dissolve corrode in response to current.

In another embodiment a transgastric fastening assembly is placed in the antrum or the region just proximal to the pyloric sphincter if deemed necessary by the gastroenterologist and or surgeon. Such a configuration would not reduce the volume of the stomach but would cause a feeling of fullness similar to a gastric outlet obstruction leading to decreased food intake and weight loss. The anchors in this region can also conduct a current to electrically stimulate the pyloric region to simulate satiety.

In another embodiment a transgastric fastening assembly may be required at the region of the cardia to treat morbid obesity in a similar manner to that utilized with the LAP BAND Inamed Corp. Santa Barbara Calif. . In this embodiment the transgastric fastening assembly is not utilized to reduce the volume of the stomach but to create a restriction to the inflow of food. In this embodiment the fastening system can traverse the cardia but does not necessarily completely oppose the mucosal surfaces of the anterior and posterior walls of the stomach. In some embodiments the transgastric assemblies do in fact completely appose the walls of the stomach together but allow food to pass through by not completely traversing the cardia leaving a space for flow of food stuffs. The assembly can further be configured to provide electrical signals to the anterior and or posterior portions of the stomach in this region. The active region of this embodiment can be quite large in some cases ranging up to 10 15 cm large enough to traverse almost the entire width of the cardia.

In another embodiment the disclosed methods in combination with the transgastric fastening assemblies can be adapted to attach a gastrointestinal organ to the abdominal wall which in addition to reducing volume can also create a kink in the organ e.g. the stomach . The kink may cause a resistance barrier in addition to volume reduction to gastrointestinal contents and can be useful to treat reflux disease or morbid obesity. Such a kink would also fix the gastrointestinal region to the abdominal wall as well as maintain the reduction of a hiatal hernia in the abdominal compartment e.g. in reflux disease . A major component of reflux disease is a hiatal hernia in which the gastroesophageal junction freely slides from the abdomen to the mediastinum. A percutaneously placed suture or anchor in the region of the gastric cardia and or fundus can tether the junction to the abdominal wall and confine the junction to the abdomen.

In other embodiments the devices and methods of this invention can assist in the implantation of devices such as stents meshes stitches or tubes in the gastrointestinal tract. A major technical difficulty encountered in placing stents tubes balloons stimulators and meshes inside the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract is that they tend to migrate because the walls of such devices do not adhere to slippery mucosa. A transgastric or transintestinal anchor implanted with the current instrumentation could solve this problem. Such a method would be particularly useful in the attachment of the stent part of the stent sleeve system outlined in patent application US20050075622A1 or the mesh of patent application US20040172141A1. In another example devices such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 773 441 attempt to place an endoscopic stitch to tether the cardia of the stomach to the fundus to treat reflux disease. Such stitches are tenuous in the long term because they do not necessarily penetrate the serosa. Even if the stitches penetrate the serosa they tend to erode through the wall with time because of their thin profile and an inability of the endoscopic operator to control tension on the suture when it is placed. With the methods and devices of this invention such an endoscopic suture can be buttressed with a percutaneously placed anchor.

Although the described methods are focused on the implantation of transgastric fastening assemblies to reduce the volume of the stomach or to increase the resistance to the flow of food in the stomach the methods and devices can easily be expanded to the implantation of other types of devices such as neurostimulators gastric muscle stimulators gastric balloons and bulking devices inside the wall of a gastrointestinal organ using the percutaneous procedures and devices described herein.

The methods disclosed herein e.g. the percutaneous procedure can further be used to apply an energy source to an internal organ without having to give general anesthesia or pneumoperitoneum. For example the methods and devices of the current invention can be used to apply radiofrequency probes microwave probes ultrasound probes and radioactive probes to the serosa in similar ways as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 872 206. The energy sources can be temporary or permanent and can be activated remotely through the abdominal wall in the case where they are implantable. The methods can further be used for diagnostic purposes prior to performing a surgical therapy. In one example the methods and devices are used to identify specific nerves or nerve plexuses prior to delivering a specific therapy. In another example specific hormone producing regions such as ghrelin are identified prior to delivering a specific therapy. Following the methods and devices outlined both above and below instruments can be placed in the abdominal cavity under percutaneous guidance. Any of the layers of the stomach can be accessed and stimulation ablation or diagnostic devices can subsequently be placed without anesthesia and without pneumoperitoneum. For example a stimulation device can be placed in any layer of the stomach wall such as the serosa or muscular layers for example.

Similarly the anchor assemblies and anchors are applied to solid organs such as the spleen kidney liver and pancreas to urge the edges of a defect together to promote healing in other embodiments the anchor assemblies are applied to the blood vessels such as arteries or veins for example the aorta or vena cava.

In still further embodiments fascial defects can be closed with the anchoring assembly described above. for example shows an anchor being delivered into a fascial defect caused by a laparoscopic port. Using similar methodology to that described above except applied to a fascial defect a posterior anchor a connector and an anterior anchor are shown in . A laparoscopic port is shown as well. After anterior anchor is threaded over connector the connector is is trimmed as described above shown in . When the anchoring assembly is in place as shown in the defect created by port is effectively closed and the connector stabilized in the anterior abdominal wall. Typically laparoscopic fascial defects are closed with sutures which can be very difficult in an obese patient. The anchor connector anchor assembly shown in is a possible solution to having to close fascial defects with sutures in obese patients.

In some embodiments the methods and devices described herein are used to place devices inside or outside the stomach inside or outside the lesser sac of the peritoneum inside or beside a structure within the retroperitoneum inside beside or outside the duodenum pylorus or gastroesophageal junction. Implanted devices include but are not limited to the anchor devices and transgastric fastening assemblies described above stents meshes stent grafts stitches stimulators and bulk forming agents can be implanted individually in combination and as a component of the same device.

In some embodiments a transgastric method of placing such stimulators is described which in some embodiments enable placement of stimulators in the lesser peritoneal space where they can stimulate the sympathetic system or directly stimulate structures in the lesser peritoneal sac such as the pancreas . In these and other embodiments the transgastric access method to the lesser peritoneal sac is used to place stimulators and stimulate and or inhibit pain fibers in and around the celiac ganglion. This type of procedure is used to treat patients with severe pain from a tumor or from pancreatitis.

Devices that circumscribe the gastroesophageal junction are well known in the art see for example U.S. Pat. No. 64 653 213 the surgical constricting balloons can be retrofitted with sensors in order to create device afferent pathways which detect overeating and simulate via device efferent pathways patient afferent pathways such as the vagus nerve or the visceral nervous system.

The methods and devices of this invention can also be used to place sutures in the stomach or pylorus to treat reflux disease or obesity. Such suturing would be facilitated by the placement of multiple ports through the walls of the stomach. Any of these methods and devices could be used in combination with or in place of the transgastric fastening assemblies to induce weight loss in a patient.

In another embodiment the novel methods implantation devices and anchors of this invention are used to implant devices in one wall of a gastrointestinal organ without volume reduction. One example of such an embodiment is illustrated in in which a balloon like device is deployed in the stomach to displace volume rather than to reduce volume from the outside. The internal balloon is similar to the posterior anchors in some of the embodiments described above. In one embodiment after initial insufflation of the stomach and placement of a laparoscopic port percutaneously and without pneumoperitoneum as described above between the abdominal wall and the anterior wall of the stomach an instrument is used to penetrate only the anterior wall of the stomach and place an inflatable intragastric balloon . Inflation is achieved through the connector lumen and the balloon is placed within the interior of the stomach as illustrated in . When inflated the balloon is preferably spherical in shape such that it occupies a substantial portion of the stomach volume when inflated. In the embodiment shown the connector also acts as the inflation tube for inflating the intragastric balloon. In another embodiment in addition to the connector there is a separate inflation tube similar to embodiments presented above. As discussed above a valve can be located between the anchor and the connector or alternatively outside the patient. Preferably after the intragastric balloon is inflated and an anterior anchor is deployed on the connector as described previously. The connector is also cut preferably flush with the anterior anchor and the laparoscopic port is removed as shown in . The anchor portion of the intragastric balloon is then fixed in the wall of the stomach. In the preferred embodiment where an inflatable anterior anchor is used the inflation tube is also cut preferably flush with the anterior anchor. Other devices which may only be implanted in one gastric wall with similar methods and with similar anchoring devices include neurostimulators muscular stimulators sensors and pharmaceutical delivery devices.

In another embodiment a surgical anastomosis is surrounded with the organ spanning anchors and anchor assemblies of the current invention. In this embodiment the anchors can buttress the anastomosis to protect the integrity of the anastomosis. The buttresses can support both hand sewn and stapler anastomotic techniques. To prevent or the anchors are placed around or through the anastomosis. In a similar embodiment a transgastric anchor system or constricting band can be used at a gastrojejunostomy in a Roux n Y bypass procedure. Both the transgastric anchor system and constricting band can further have associated electrically activateable elements by which flow through the anastomosis can be controlled.

The anchors and bands as described above can also be used to control the flow of material through an anastomosis. Flow control is attainable when an anchoring assembly is applied across an anastomosis and are linked by means of a connector through the anastomosis. The distance between the anchors determines the amount of flow through the anastomosis and therefore the flow rate can be adjusted quite readily with the device of the current invention. The flow rate is adjustable at anytime during or after the operation. Luminal devices to control the flow rate through an anastomosis can be found in US patent application number 20050022827. The devices of the current invention can be used to accomplish the goal of controlling flow through an anastomosis by placing anchors on either side of the anastomosis with a connector that traverses the anastomosis. Furthermore the anastomotic flow control device can further have automated control using the materials methods and control systems described above in order to automatically adjust flow control or tension on the anastomosis.

In another embodiment the anchor assemblies are applied to the lung to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD via functional lung reduction. Rather than removing a portion of the lung the surgical procedure the anchors of the current invention are placed through the diseased portion of the lung to close off or at least create a large resistance in one portion of the lung and broncheoalveolar tree so that inspired air does not reach a malfunctioning portion of the lung.

In other embodiments of the current invention the fastening systems and tools to implant the fastening systems are used to secure closure or repair of blood vessels. The blood vessels can be named vessels such as the aorta vena cava pulmonary veins pulmonary arteries renal vein renal artery inferior mesenteric vein and or artery splenic vein and or artery portal vein and or hepatic artery or the saphenous and or deep veins. Alternatively the vessels are unnamed such as in the case of the mesentery of the colon or small bowel. Vessel closure with the current system is possibly more efficient than current laparoscopic means of vessel closure which involve staple or clip occlusion of the vessels staples and clips do not penetrate the vessel and therefore are often inadequate or at least do not replicate what a surgeon would do in an open procedure which is place a suture through the vessel to suture ligate it as is well known in the art.

It is also possible that a part of or any or all of the devices and methods described above are performed with an alternative imaging means for example fluoroscope MRI ultrasound and CAT scan.

Although the present invention has been described in the context of certain preferred or illustrative embodiments it should be understood that the scope of the exclusive right granted by this patent is not limited to those embodiments but instead is the full lawful scope of the appended claims.

Furthermore any of the devices methods surgical instruments and features can be used singly or together in order to treat any of the disorders or diseases mentioned above.
