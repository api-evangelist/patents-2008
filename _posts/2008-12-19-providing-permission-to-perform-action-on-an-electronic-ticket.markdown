title: Providing permission to perform action on an electronic ticket
abstract: Described are methods and systems related to providing permission to a user to perform an action on a workflow driven ticket. The ticket is accessed to determine an action type to be performed on the ticket and a correlated object associated therewith. A role based permission tuple is determined based upon a role of the user. A ticket based permission tuple is determined by generating a universal permission tuple based upon the action type and generating a dependency map based upon the correlated object. The dependency map is mapped to the universal permission tuple to construct the ticket based permission tuple. The role based permission tuple is supplemented with the ticket based permission tuple, to provide the required permission to execute the action. Upon an execution of the action, the permission is partially revoked, by removing the ticket based permission tuple.

Embodiments of the invention generally relate to the field of workflow management and more particularly they relate to methods and systems to provide permission to perform an action on a workflow driven ticket.

Workflow management generally relates to managing the execution of a series of processes designed to accomplish some work. Processes in a workflow are made up of a sequence of tasks that may depend on one another and the execution of the tasks may need to take these dependencies into account in order to accomplish the desired work. In one sense workflows are abstract representations of patterns of activities executed according to a business context determined by among other things the types of resources involved the roles of the individuals asked to execute the tasks and the types of tasks involved.

In an enterprise context workflow management is used to accomplish a wide variety of business activities such as approving purchases hiring sales marketing and so on. Such activities will have a security component at least because it may involve accessing sensitive information or restrictions on appropriate permissions needed to take certain actions. Enterprise access control applications typically manage permissions and access based on the statically pre determined role of a user. However in a dynamic workflow situation certain tasks or activities may be delegated or otherwise received by individuals who may not have all the access or authority needed to accomplish the tasks they have been assigned based solely on their static role definition. Thus the task may be left incomplete mainly because a user is allowed to access the task but may not be allowed to work on the task. In other words the user may not have all the permissions needed to perform the necessary tasks to complete the activity that is in their workflow. Therefore a method and system is required for providing such permission to perform action necessary to complete the business process.

Described are methods and systems related to providing permission to a user to perform an action on a workflow driven ticket. To perform an action on the workflow driven ticket one or more of permissions may be required by the user. In one aspect a role definition of the user and a role assignment of the user may be used to determine role based permissions for the user. The permission that is provided based upon the role of the user may be described in the form of a role based permission tuple that lists an object and the action that a user with the appropriate permissions can perform on that object.

In one embodiment additional ticket based permissions may be provided temporarily and specified as a set of objects and corresponding operations that have to be performed that are specific to the ticket. In another embodiment any ticket based permission could supplement any permission that the user may already have e.g. role based permissions . The ticket itself could comprise information sufficient enough to enable such access. For instance in one aspect to provide the additional permissions the ticket is parsed to access an action type to be performed on the ticket and a correlated object associated with the action to be performed. Based on the action type a universal permission tuple is determined. In one embodiment the universal permission tuple includes one or more object types and the corresponding operations allowed to be performed on the object types associated with the ticket. Based upon the correlated object associated with the ticket a dependency map is generated. The dependency map identifies one or more auxiliary objects related to the correlated object. The dependency map and the universal permission tuple are mapped to construct a ticket based permission tuple. The ticket based permission tuple is a particular permission tuple constructed based upon an instance of an object type and a corresponding operation to be performed on the object type that is particular to the ticket. The ticket based permission tuple supplements the role based permission tuple to provide complete permission that may be needed to perform the action on the ticket.

In yet another aspect dependency maps are generated by determining auxiliary objects based on identifying objects hierarchically related to the correlated object. In one embodiment at least one target auxiliary object type is identified along with a direction in which to traverse a hierarchy of which the correlated object is a part. The auxiliary object can be identified by traversing the hierarchy until the object of target type is encountered and all objects below the target object in the hierarchy are designated as auxiliary objects of the correlated object for generating the dependency map.

In an embodiment the ticket based permission tuple is removed based upon the completion of the action on the ticket. The removal of the ticket based permission tuple would revoke the complete permission provided on the ticket. On removal of the ticket based permission tuple the user will no longer have permission to perform the necessary action on the ticket. By restricting the permission the action to be performed on the workflow ticket is restricted to the intended user at the intended time. The ticket does not accept any modifications to be performed once the partial permission is revoked. Also the types of operations that have to be performed on the ticket are monitored.

In an embodiment an already existing permission is supplemented with the additional permission e.g. ticket based permission tuple . This additional permission is independent from currently available permissions. Thus the application programming interface API layer does not require any modification with respect to permission logic that is currently available. The additional permission is only being inserted to the existing permission logic to generate the permissions needed for executing an action on the ticket.

These and other benefits and features of embodiments of the invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following description of embodiments thereof presented in connection with the following drawings in which like reference numerals are used to identify like elements throughout.

A workflow is a process that is made up of a sequence of processes or tasks which may be dependent on each other. Tasks are specific pieces of work that may need to be carried out to perform an action. According to one embodiment a workflow driven ticket is a collection of information received via workflow for instance requesting that the recipient take a specific action with respect to the content of the ticket. The workflow ticket is a specific instance of a workflow task that is instantiated at runtime and is sometimes also referred to as a workflow item. The information in the ticket may include details about the type of action to be completed one or more objects that are involved in the action operations that have to be performed on the objects and the like. In one embodiment an object associated with a ticket is a collection of any type of data including but not limited to text documents such as forms database tables reports analytics graphics images business objects hyperlinks and so on. Thus the objects could be some information needed to perform the action. The action itself need not be directly on the object itself. So the action could include but is not limited to approving reviewing editing and commenting on the object itself. However the action itself could be some operation that needs to be performed based on the information provided in the object. Each object may have metadata associated with it that describe its attributes characteristics components properties relationships and any other data that describe the object.

A user is notified of a ticket via workflow notifications in the form of emails additions to their universal task list and other messages that could alert the user to the presence of a new ticket that needs their attention. However users receiving these tickets need permission to take the actions described in the ticket.

In one embodiment a user role data repository may include information about the users allowed to work on various ticket types such as his or her role assignment and the role definition. Based upon the role definition and role assignment of the user from user role data repository role based permission tuple is determined. Role based permission tuple is just one exemplary method of specifying permissions needed to complete the action specified in the ticket . The role based permission tuple includes permissions that are available to the user based on their role alone. The role based permission tuple may be in the form of a permission pair including an object and an operation that the holder of the permission is allowed to perform on the object.

In an embodiment role based permission tuple which is provided based upon the role of the user may not be sufficient to perform the specified action on ticket . An additional set of permissions may be necessary to complete the action. To determine this additional set of permissions ticket is parsed to access the action type and the correlated object associated with ticket . Based upon the action type required metadata is retrieved from ticket metadata repository to determine a generalized set of permissions referred to herein as universal permission tuple that may be needed by a user to perform the specified action on the ticket . Universal permission tuple includes tuples of object types and corresponding operations to be performed on the object types. The object types define the type of objects e.g. documents data and images that a user may need to access alter create and so on in to order complete the action associated with the ticket . The corresponding operations define what the users are allowed to do with the object types that are associated with ticket . For example the object types that are associated with ticket may include EVALUATION SALES DEAL CUSTOMER PRODUCT BALANCE SHEET BILL OF MATERIALS PURCHASE ORDER INVOICE . The corresponding operations for the object types may include CREATE RETRIEVE MODIFY ASSESS TALLY APPROVE ORDER and the like.

The ticket in a workflow typically includes a correlated object pertaining to an action associated with the ticket e.g. ticket . However to perform the action specified on the ticket the user may be required to access or otherwise interact with objects other than the correlated object. In one embodiment these other objects can be identified based on their relationships or dependencies with the correlated object of the ticket . Such auxiliary objects may be objects that exist around the correlated object associated with ticket . The auxiliary objects that are present around the correlated object may be determined based upon a relationship of the correlated object. For instance depending upon where a correlated object exists in a hierarchical chain.

The collection of auxiliary objects can be structured as a dependency map identifying one or more auxiliary objects that are related to the correlated object associated with ticket and the corresponding relationships. For example the correlated object of ticket is SALES DEAL 123 . The metadata about SALES DEAL 123 may note that this particular sales deal pertains to PRODUCT XYZ and CUSTOMER ABC. Thus the auxiliary objects PRODUCT XYZ and CUSTOMER ABC can be included in a dependency map for the ticket . Typically auxiliary objects are specific to the correlated object of a ticket e.g. .

The metadata needed to identify these auxiliary objects can be retrieved from ticket metadata repository . Some of the data needed to determine the dependency map could also be included in the ticket itself. In one embodiment starting with the object referred to by the workflow driven ticket the object hierarchy is traversed until a target object is found. In one embodiment the target object is specified in the metadata but preferably the metadata does not refer to specific instances of target objects since these are not known at the time the metadata is built. Therefore it refers to a type of target object. In the sales deal evaluation for SALES DEAL 123 the metadata could define that permissions should be granted on all products within the same organization unit as the sales deal is defined for. So the object type of the target would be ORGUNIT a hierarchy traversing mode may be upwards. The dependency map determination process will now traverse the hierarchy upwards starting with the SALES DEAL 123 looking for an object type ORGUNIT. Once an object of type ORGUNIT is encountered the process will traverse downwards in order to discover all child objects of that organizational unit and for each child of type PRODUCT the user will be granted DISPLAY permission based on the universal permission tuple PRODUCT DISPLAY .

Universal permission tuple and dependency map are mapped to construct ticket based permission tuple that is particular to the ticket in question. Ticket based permission tuple is a particular permission tuple that is constructed specifically for ticket and in an embodiment has a life that is only as long as the ticket . This particular permission tuple defines a particular instance of an object and a corresponding operation to be performed on the ticket . The particular instance of the object and the corresponding operation is determined based upon mapping information about the correlated object the auxiliary objects and the universal permission tuples by using the object types as the key. For instance the instance of the object type may be the correlated object type that is defined in ticket and the corresponding operation may be the operation that is defined in the universal permission tuple for that object type. For example the instance of the object type may be SALES DEAL 123 and the operation to be performed may be RETRIEVE .

The constructed ticket based permission tuple provides additional permissions based upon the action types and the correlated objects of ticket that was not provided by role based permission tuple . Ticket based permission tuple supplements the role based permission tuple to provide the complete permission needed to execute the action on ticket . In an embodiment ticket based permission tuple is temporary and is removed based upon the completion of the action on ticket . The removal of ticket based permission tuple would revoke some of the permissions provided but the role based permission would remain.

Referring first to based upon a role definition and a role assignment defined for a role of a user a role based permission tuple is determined. Role based permission tuple includes an object and a corresponding operation to be performed on the object that the user is allowed to perform. For instance a role definition for a first user JOHN may be a CUSTOMER CARE REPRESENTATIVE and the role assignment may be CUSTOMER ABC . The role based permission tuple for ticket for John includes object CUSTOMER ABC and corresponding operation EDIT . The role based permission tuple for John includes the object and the corresponding operation that John is allowed to perform and defines permission based upon John s role.

In an embodiment these permissions may not be sufficient to complete the execution of the ticket . Some additional permission may be necessary for performing the action on the ticket . Here John has permission to edit the customer records of CUSTOMER ABC but this permission does not allow John to evaluate a SALES DEAL 123 that may be defined for a particular product of CUSTOMER ABC . To provide the additional permission the ticket is parsed to access the action type to be performed on the ticket and a correlated object associated with the ticket . Based upon the action type of the ticket universal permission tuple is determined. Universal permission tuple includes the object types and the corresponding operations to be performed on the object types associated with the ticket . For instance universal permission tuple includes object type EVALUATION and corresponding operation CREATE object type SALES DEAL and corresponding operation RETRIEVE object type PRODUCT and corresponding operation ACCESS and object type CUSTOMER and corresponding operation ACCESS . This list preferably comprises all the permissions needed for John to perform the action on ticket . However it is possible that some of the permissions needed to accomplish the operation could also be defined based on the role of the person. For instance user John who is a customer care representative for customer ABC at has a role based permission to EDIT customer records for customer ABC which is a higher permission than the permission ACCESS required to perform the action on the ticket . In this case the role based permission supersedes the ticket based permission regarding the customer record for customer ABC.

However not all the necessary permissions can be obtained based on user s role. In that event one has to rely on the temporary access provided by the ticket based permission tuple . The ticket based permission tuple is created by particularizing the universal permission tuple to the ticket based upon its correlated object. Dependency map identifies one or more auxiliary objects related to the correlated object and the corresponding identifiers. For instance dependency map identifies the auxiliary object CUSTOMER ABC and auxiliary object PRODUCT XYZ that are related to SALES DEAL 123 .

Dependency map and universal permission tuple are mapped to construct ticket based permission tuple that particularizes the universal permission tuple to the particular ticket . It is this strong association of the ticket based permission tuple to the ticket and the action associated with the ticket that allows the system to provide the needed permissions without having a large overhead for maintaining the lifecycle of these permissions. The temporary permissions simply expire when the ticket is cleaned up after the action on the ticket is completed. Ticket based permission tuple is a particular permission tuple constructed based upon an instance of an object type and a corresponding operation to be performed on the object type that is particular to ticket . For instance ticket based permission tuple includes an instance of a new object type EVALUATION OF SALES DEAL and corresponding operation CREATE the instance of the object type SALES DEAL 123 and corresponding operation RETRIEVE the instance of the object type PRODUCT XYZ and corresponding operation ACCESS and the instance of the object type CUSTOMER ABC and corresponding operation ACCESS .

Ticket based permission tuple is supplemented to role based permission tuple to construct master permission tuple to provide complete permission to perform the action on ticket . Master permission tuple now includes object type CUSTOMER ABC and corresponding operation EDIT object type EVALUATE SALES DEAL and corresponding operation CREATE object type SALES DEAL 123 and corresponding operation RETRIEVE and object type PRODUCT XYZ and corresponding operation ACCESS . Each object type and corresponding operation in master permission tuple is an instance of the object type and corresponding operation that is particular to ticket . However as noted above where role based permissions provide permissions at levels at or above what is required for the action the role based permissions preferably supersede the ticket based permissions. Ticket based permission tuple may be removed from master permission tuple based upon the completion of the action on ticket .

In an embodiment these permissions may not be sufficient to complete the execution of the ticket . Some additional permission may be necessary for performing the action on the ticket . Here in Lisa has permission to access PRODUCT XYZ but this permission does not allow Lisa to evaluate a SALES DEAL 123 that may be defined for a particular CUSTOMER ABC . To provide the additional permission the ticket is parsed to access the action type to be performed on the ticket and a correlated object associated with the ticket . Based upon the action type of the ticket universal permission tuple is determined. Universal permission tuple includes object type EVALUATION and corresponding operation CREATE object type SALES DEAL and corresponding operation RETRIEVE object type PRODUCT and corresponding operation ACCESS and object type CUSTOMER and corresponding operation ACCESS . This list preferably comprises all the permissions needed for Lisa to perform the action on ticket . However it is possible that some of the permissions needed to accomplish the operation could also come based on the role of the person. For instance user Lisa who is a product manager for product XYZ at has a role based permission to EDIT product records for product XYZ which is a higher permission than the permission ACCESS required to perform the action on the ticket . In this case the role based permission supersedes the ticket based permission regarding the product record for product XYZ.

However not all the necessary permissions can be obtained based on user s role. In that event one has to rely on the temporary access provided by the ticket based permission tuple . The ticket based permission tuple is created by particularizing the universal permission tuple to the ticket based upon its correlated object. Dependency map identifies one or more auxiliary objects related to the correlated object and the corresponding identifiers. For instance dependency map identifies the auxiliary object PRODUCT XYZ and auxiliary object CUSTOMER ABC that are related to SALES DEAL 123 .

Dependency map and universal permission tuple are mapped to construct ticket based permission tuple that particularizes the universal permission tuple to the particular ticket . It is this strong association of the ticket based permission tuple to the ticket and the action associated with ticket that allows the system to provide the needed permissions without having a large overhead for maintaining the lifecycle of these permissions. The temporary permissions simply expire when the ticket is cleaned up after the action on the ticket is completed. Ticket based permission tuple is a particular permission tuple constructed based upon an instance of an object type and a corresponding operation to be performed on the object type that is particular to ticket . For instance ticket based permission tuple includes an instance of a new object EVALUATION OF SALES DEAL and corresponding operation CREATE the instance of the object type SALES DEAL 123 and corresponding operation RETRIEVE the instance of the object type PRODUCT XYZ and corresponding operation ACCESS and the instance of the object type CUSTOMER ABC and corresponding operation ACCESS .

Ticket based permission tuple is supplemented to role based permission tuple to construct master permission tuple to provide complete permission to perform the action on ticket . Master permission tuple now includes object type PRODUCT XYZ and corresponding operation EDIT object type EVALUATE SALES DEAL and corresponding operation CREATE object type SALES DEAL 123 and corresponding operation RETRIEVE and object type CUSTOMER ABC and corresponding operation ACCESS . Each object type and corresponding operation in master permission tuple is an instance of the object type and corresponding operation that is particular to ticket . However as noted above where role based permissions provide permissions at levels at or above what is required for the action the role based permissions preferably supersede the ticket based permissions. Ticket based permission tuple may be removed from master permission tuple based upon the completion of the action on ticket .

In process block based upon the action type of the ticket a universal permission tuple is determined. The universal permission tuple includes one or more object types and corresponding operations to be performed on the object types associated with the ticket. In process block based upon the correlated object associated with the ticket a dependency map is generated. The dependency map identifies one or more auxiliary objects related to the correlated object. In process block the dependency map is mapped to the universal permission tuple to construct a ticket based permission tuple. The ticket based permission tuple is a particular permission tuple constructed based upon an instance of an object type and a corresponding operation to be performed on the object type that is particular to the ticket. The ticket based permission tuple provides the additional permission necessary to perform the action on the ticket.

In process block the ticket based permission tuple is supplemented to the role based permission tuple to provide complete permission to perform the action on the ticket. In process block based upon completion of the action on the ticket the permission is partially revoked by removing the ticket based permission tuple.

System provides permission to the user to perform the action on ticket . Ticket includes an action to be executed on the ticket and a correlated object associated with the ticket . The correlated object may include the object on which the action needs to be performed. Based upon a role of the user authorization engine determines necessary permissions to generate role based permission tuples particular to the ticket e.g. based on the role of the user receiving the ticket from the role based permission tuple stored in the user role assignment repository . In an embodiment these role based permissions may not be sufficient to complete the execution of the action on the ticket . An additional set of permissions may be necessary to complete the action. To determine this additional set of permissions authorization engine calls API layer to parse ticket and access the action type and correlated object associated with ticket . Based upon the action type required metadata is retrieved from ticket metadata repository to determine universal permission tuple that may be needed by the user to perform the specified action on ticket . In an embodiment universal permission tuple may be stored on ticket metadata repository . Based upon the correlated object pertaining to the action associated with the ticket required metadata is retrieved from ticket metadata repository to determine dependency map . Dependency map identifies one or more auxiliary objects that are related to the correlated object.

Authorization engine maps universal permission tuple and dependency map to construct ticket based permission tuple based on the mapping. Ticket based permission tuple is a particular permission tuple that is constructed specifically to ticket and may have a life that is only as long as ticket . This particular permission tuple defines a particular instance of an object and a corresponding operation to be performed on the ticket . The constructed ticket based permission tuple provides additional permissions based upon the action types and the correlated objects of ticket that was not provided by role based permission tuple . In an embodiment ticket based permission tuple may be temporarily stored in ticket metadata repository . Authorization engine supplements role based permission tuple with ticket based permission tuple to provide complete permission to execute the action on ticket . Once the ticket based permission tuple is available along with the role based permission tuple business logic execution engine executes necessary action on ticket . In an embodiment ticket based permission tuple is temporary and is removed based upon the completion of the action on ticket . The removal of ticket based permission tuple would revoke the some of the permissions provided but the role based permission tuple would remain.
