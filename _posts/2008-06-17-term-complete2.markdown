title: Term complete
abstract: Real-time query expansion (RTQE) is a process of supplementing an original query with additional terms or expansion choices that are ranked according to some figure of merit and presented while users are still formulating their queries. As disclosed herein, individual terms may be combined and submitted as a phrase into a query. By building the phase term-by-term, users can compositionally formulate queries while maintaining the same benefits that other RTQE interfaces offer. To promote greater flexibility in its working environment, the number of terms that are presented on a display may be reduced. In place of some terms, placeholders may be used and expanded by the user when necessary. This allows phrases to be readily presented on small displays (e.g., hand-held devices).

Today many computer related applications help to facilitate quicker and more accurate text entry. For example computers often have an auto complete application that allows the computer to store terms that have been frequently typed such as a website address and fill in the missing terms whenever the user begins to reenter the terms at a later date.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

As provided herein one or more techniques are disclosed that enhance a user s ability to arrive at a desired phrase by auto completing or suggesting terms that may be desired in a search. In one example a real time query expansion RTQE interface on a hand held device can be enhanced while lessening memory space requirements and increasing the usability and effectiveness of text entry for hand held devices such as cellular telephones for example. An RTQE generally comprises one or more databases of terms or expansion choices that are associated in some manner such that when a user enters a first term or part of a first term a second term or part of the first term is automatically produced.

As provided herein a user is presented with first and second lists e.g. where the first list may be a currently focused list and the second list a subsequent list of predetermined terms where the second list of terms is a function of a term focused on in the first list either by default or in response to user input. Lists of terms can be presented in a compact manner by representing one or more terms e.g. that have a lower figure of merit as a generic placeholder. Terms represented by a placeholder can be viewed by selecting the corresponding placeholder to zoom in on this collapsed segment of the list.

In one example a first list of predetermined terms may comprise often chosen terms. Additionally where fewer than all of the terms in the first list are presented to a user e.g. due to the compactness of a display the terms that are presented may be those that have a higher figure of merit e.g. according to some context of interest . Moreover the contents of the first list that are displayed to a user may vary depending upon user input. For example the contents of the first list that are displayed may be adjusted as a user begins to spell out a desired term e.g. in a character entry field .

The content of the second list e.g. subsequent list is correspondingly updated when a term in the first list e.g. currently focused list is focused on e.g. either by default and or by user input . For example the second list may comprise terms that would commonly follow the term focused on in the first list. Additionally where fewer than all of the terms in the second list are presented to the user e.g. due to the compactness of a display the terms that are presented may be those that have a higher figure of merit e.g. as relates back to the term focused on in the first list .

Once a user selects a term in the first list the user may then focus on a term in the second list different from a term focused on by default in the second list which affects the content of a third list e.g. another subsequent list that is displayed. The user can then select a term in the second list and focus on a term in the third list which affects the content of a fourth list that is displayed etc. The user may continue to scroll through the lists in this manner until a desired phrase is selected. Once terms constructing a desired phrase are selected the user may accept the phrase e.g. by clicking an accept button and the phrase will be presented in a character entry field. The user can also generate a new phrase for example by jumping back to a previous list unselecting a selected term and focusing on a different term.

This process allows the user greater flexibility in choosing phrases by letting the user choose terms commonly associated with prior selected terms rather than making the user choose an entire phrase as traditional RTQE interfaces require. It significantly expedites the process of creating a phrase by reducing the number of keystrokes adding great convenience to a user particularly on a handheld device since such devices typically have relatively small keys or other input mechanisms. Additionally if a query is to be run using the accepted phrase it increases the accuracy of the search by helping users choose relevant terms that may aid in a search engine s retrieval process.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

Turning initially to an exemplary methodology is illustrated for building phrases using real time query expansion RTQE by separately selecting terms linked with one another according to some criteria. In one example the phrases can be so constructed and used for entering a query into a handheld device such as a cellular telephone for example. At a first list e.g. a currently focused list of predetermined terms e.g. terms being stored in a hand held as a function of the device s storage capacity is presented in a first manner based on a figure of merit for the different terms in the list. For example where the size of a display upon which the list is going to be presented to a user is too small to accommodate all of the terms in the list merely the ten or so terms in the list having higher figures of merit may be presented on the display e.g. with undisplayed terms represented as a generic placeholder . Additionally the term in the list having the highest figure of merit for example may be presented in some distinguishing manner e.g. bold different color etc. . One example of a figure of merit may comprise a consideration of the popularity of one or more terms e.g. relative to some context of interest . A term might include but is not limited to a word number or symbol for example but generally does not include a complete phrase. A term in the first list may be focused on by default e.g. the term having the highest figure of merit the most popular term in the list etc. or by user input which would override a default focus. To focus on other than a default term a user may scroll to a different term in the list and or input e.g. into a character entry field part of a desired term until the desired term appears on the list which can then be focused on by the user. A character may include but is not limited to a letter number or symbol for example. It will be appreciated that user input can also include a variety of actions including for example navigation into a drop down menu and or control to access previous queries and or popular query logs for example.

The contents of a second list e.g. a subsequent list are adjusted at based upon the term in the first list that is focused on. That is if a user scrolls up and down the first list the terms in the second list will be adjusted as different terms in the first list are focused on e.g. highlighted during scrolling. As an example the second list of terms might be generated based on the most common term that would be typed after the term focused on in the first list to complete a phrase e.g. those terms would have a higher figure of merit based upon the term focused on in the first list . In one example fewer than all of the terms in the second list may be presented at once e.g. due to the compactness of a display and a placeholder may be used to represent one or more undisplayed terms. In this situation the terms in the second list that are displayed may have a higher figure of merit e.g. as relates back to the term focused on in the first list . Moreover a term in the second list having the highest figure of merit may be focused on in the second list by default once a term in the first list has been selected. A user may be able to override this focus by scrolling to and focusing on a different term in the second list and or entering into a character entry field part of a desired term until the desired term appears on the second list which can then be focused on selected and ultimately accepted by the user.

Once a term in the first list and a term in the second list have been selected the terms are linked to form a phrase at . It will be appreciated that even though multiple lists are discussed herein the phrase may merely include one word e.g. from one list . The user may accept the phrase causing it to be presented in a character entry field. An example of where the phrase may be used is on an Internet search engine. The process can be repeated for additional lists the contents of which are a function of the term focused on in the prior list and terms can be focused on in these lists to expand the phrase for example. Alternatively where additional lists e.g. additional subsequent lists are presented a user can halt the process by accepting the phrase as constructed e.g. presenting the phrase in a character entry field where a query is conducted based upon the currently established or constructed phrase . It will also be appreciated that the terms in the different lists e.g. first second third etc. and or currently focused subsequent etc. may be altered based upon the available real estate on a display. For example terms can be respectively added to or removed from a list when a larger or smaller display screen is used. Similarly more terms of a list may be presented on a device having a larger display screen while fewer terms of the same list may be presented on a different device having a smaller display screen.

By way of example demonstrate at least some of the advantages of building a phrase term by term e.g. as provided in . More particularly illustrate a display comprising a character entry field a left boundary for a first list a right boundary for a first list a first list of predetermined terms a right boundary for a second list a left boundary for a second list and a second list of predetermined terms. In the illustrated example the first and second lists are presented in alphabetical order and through a fish eye technique such that terms having a higher figure of merit e.g. more popular more relevant etc. are presented in the middle of the lists in a more distinguished manner e.g. larger font relative to other terms presented in the lists. It will be appreciated however that such a fish eye technique is not necessary and that other presentation schemes are possible. illustrates the display without user input e.g. which may alter the items displayed in the first and or second lists . Based on a term focused on in the first list either by default and or user action such as scrolling and or text entry etc. a second list of predetermined terms is presented in a first manner. In the illustrated example the terms focused on in the first list is presented in a box. It will be appreciated however that focused terms can be presented in other distinguishing manners such as underlined different colors encircled etc.

As illustrated in once a first term is selected in the first list of predetermined terms for example customer and the second list of predetermined terms is presented in a first manner and a term in the second list is focused on e.g. service a third list of predetermined terms may be presented in a first manner. This third list comprises terms having a higher figure of merit as based upon the selected term in the first list and the focused term in the second list of predetermined terms. Additionally as in the first and second lists where fewer than all of the terms in the third list are displayed those terms that are presented in the first manner may have a higher figure of merit for example. Additional lists of predetermined terms can be displayed in a similar manner based upon selected and focused terms in previous lists.

As illustrates a user may accept the phrase as constructed in . The phrase e.g. customer service training is then entered into a character entry field and or a query may be conducted. In one example the user may continue to type characters and or terms after the accepted phrase is entered into the character entry field e.g. to type a phrase not commonly typed .

From the list of obtained terms the list of terms is presented in a first manner at the presentation of which is a function of among other things the size of a display upon which the terms are presented. The number of terms displayed for example may be a function of the height and width of a display on a handheld device and or desired font size of the terms e.g. the smaller the screen and the larger the font the fewer terms displayed . In one example those terms with a higher figure of merit e.g. more popular terms more relevant terms etc. may be presented in the first manner. The figure of merit might change for example if the user begins to input a part of a desired term into a character entry field. In another example there may be n term only slots in which to place terms and m open slots in which to place either terms or placeholders in a given list as a function of the height and width of the display. A term with a higher figure of merit e.g. as compared to other terms that are displayed for example may be placed in the middle slot and other terms that are displayed may be placed in term only slots before or after the term in the middle slot as a function of their lexicographical order for example. Once term only slots are filled terms that fall between terms displayed in term only slots may be displayed or a placeholder may be presented e.g. where there are too many terms in the list that fall alphabetically between two displayed terms .

In some instances one or more terms in the list may not be displayed e.g. when there are limitations on the size of the display . Where terms in the list are unable to be displayed the list may be presented in a first manner and a generic placeholder may be used as a substitute for the undisplayed terms. For example an ellipse may be placed between two terms presented in the first manner to indicate that there are other relevant terms that are unable to be presented in the first manner. In one example the placeholder represents terms that are alphabetically in between the two nearest displayed terms. A placeholder can be presented even if the terms that are displayed change e.g. different terms are presented with a higher figure of merit relative to those that are not presented because of user input .

Terms may be presented in a second manner where a placeholder is selected at and a second list may not be presented since the first term focused on is a placeholder. In one example a user may select the placeholder and one or more terms that were represented by a placeholder may be displayed. If all terms represented by the placeholder are not able to be displayed one or more placeholders may again be used in this zoomed in view. The user may continue to zoom in and out by selecting different placeholders until a desired term is displayed.

By way of example demonstrate at least some of the advantages of presenting a list of terms with placeholders e.g. as provided in . More particularly illustrate a display comprising a character entry field a left boundary of a list a right boundary of a list a first list e.g. a currently focused list of terms presented in a first manner a placeholder and a second list e.g. a subsequent list . In the illustrated example the placeholder is an ellipse between displayed terms earthlink and ebay. These terms presented in the first manner may have a higher figure of merit e.g. their relative popularity relative to other terms on the list for example and a placeholder is used to represent terms with a lower figure of merit between earthlink and ebay. 

In the placeholder is focused on e.g. a user focused on the ellipses and the second list is not presented. When the user selects and zooms into the placeholder some terms in the first list not able to be presented in the first manner are presented in a second manner in . In the illustrated example terms with a higher figure of merit that fall alphabetically between two terms presented in the first manner are presented in the second manner . It will be appreciated that any ordering is contemplated e.g. something other than alphabetical . It will also be appreciated that when a selected placeholder is unselected the list of terms presented in the first manner may be presented again. In the example illustrated a user may select a back arrow and the terms presented in the first manner will reappear e.g. returning to the illustration in . It will also be appreciated that a placeholder may be used in the presentation of terms in the second manner where one or more terms in the obtained list are unable to be displayed.

By way of example illustrates one device where a phrase generator can be implemented as provided herein. It comprises a hand held device with a numerical keyboard and a display . The output of a phrase generator may appear on the screen as illustrated for example. Implementing a phrase generator as provided herein would be useful because of the difficulties e.g. a limited number of keys multiple terms assigned to a key the size of the keys associated with typing on the relatively small numerical keyboard or other miniature input device e.g. a keyboard or virtual keyboard .

The first and second term acquisition components obtain a first and second list respectively from the storage component e.g. database . The storage component may contain for example all terms commonly used to generate a query in a search engine. The acquired terms from the first and second term acquisition components are then forwarded to the first and second storage components respectively. In one example these terms are stored on a handheld device where terms with prefixes less than some threshold e.g. as many characters as memory allows are stored in a hash table and terms with prefixes greater than some threshold are stored in secondary and more memory efficient indexes.

The first term ranking component ranks the first terms according to some figure of merit e.g. popularity of the term relevance of the term etc. . A term s figure of merit may also be altered as a function of user input at the phrase generator component . For example if a user begins to type cus the terms that begin with cus will have a higher figure of merit than terms that being with goo. As a function of a term ranked term in the first ranking component the second term ranking component ranks the terms stored in the second storage component according to some figure of merit. For example if customer is focused on e.g. ranked higher from the first term ranking component terms that are commonly associated with customer e.g. service support etc. may be ranked higher than if the first term focused on was earthquake. A term s figure of merit may also be altered as a function of user input at the phrase generator component. For example if the user at the phrase generator component selects customer as the first term and the terms ranked higher in the second list are undesirable to the user the user may accept the first term and begin to type a part of a desired second term until a term that is desired is ranked higher by the second term ranking component .

After the first term ranking component and the second term ranking component rank the terms in the first and second lists respectively the term filer component determines which terms will be displayed as a function of the size of an associated display . For example on a handheld device the display may be capable of only presenting five terms in first and second list prominently. Therefore for example the five terms from the first and second lists with a higher rank would be presented more prominently. A placeholder for example may be used where one or more terms on the lists are unable to be presented in a first manner. The display then presents the list with the terms chosen by the term filter component presented more prominently.

From the words presented more prominently on the display the user may select a term from the first and second lists. The phrase generator component takes the terms selected from the first and second lists and combines them to form a phrase. This phrase may be accepted by the user and used in a query on an Internet search engine for example.
