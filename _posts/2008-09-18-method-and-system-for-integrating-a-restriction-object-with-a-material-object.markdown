This application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 025 835 filed Feb. 4 2008 titled METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR INTEGRATING A RESTRICTION OBJECT WITH A MATERIAL OBJECT which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Embodiments of the invention generally relate to computer systems and more particularly to a method and system for integrating a restriction object with a material object.

In production systems a material object typically is a complete structured list of the components or materials that make up a product. The structured list contains the description the quantity and unit of measure of the components. The material object typically includes a hierarchy of nodes with each node having one or more material positions. Each material position generally has one material that may be used to produce the product. A material is typically selected from a corresponding material position based on a selection condition. The selection condition is typically a Boolean expression. A material from a material position is generally selected for production of the product only if the selection condition for the material position is true. A restriction object typically holds one or more restriction conditions that typically have information about the quantity restrictions for one or more materials.

For example the material object may have a list of materials for manufacturing a passenger car. A material at a material position may be configured to be chosen for the production of the car based on a selection condition such as a red car for sale in European countries. The restriction object may have a restriction condition that limits the supply of the material to 500 pieces a day.

The current production systems have the material objects and the restriction objects as independent objects with no integration between them. The restriction condition for a material is generally assigned to the selection condition. Thus there is a need to know the material positions in the material object that have the selection condition assigned to them. As there is no integration between the restriction object and the material object it is very difficult to find out the material positions in the material object. There may be several restriction conditions defined for various materials in the restriction object resulting in several production bottlenecks at various material positions in the material object. The absence of integration between the restriction object and the material object makes it very difficult to determine the position of the bottlenecks in the material objects. Thus there is no transparency of information as the bottlenecks are not visible by looking at the material object.

Furthermore the absence of integration between the material object and the restriction object may lead to data inconsistency. For example a material may be deleted from the material object and a restriction condition for the material may still exist in the restriction object.

Embodiments of the invention are generally directed to a method and system for integrating a restriction object with a material object. A reference is generated between a material object and a restriction object. A restriction note is received from a supplier having a material restriction for a material in the material object. A material position is searched in the material object using a material number of the material. A selection condition is determined based on which the material is chosen from the material position. A restriction condition is generated in the restriction object based on the material restriction and the selection condition.

These and other benefits and features of embodiments of the invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof presented in connection with the following drawings in which like reference numerals are used to identify like elements throughout.

A restriction condition is generated in the restriction object based on the material restriction and the selection condition.

Restriction object typically holds one or more restriction conditions. A restriction condition typically includes a material restriction for the material. The material restriction for the material generally includes a maximum quantity of the material to be supplied by supplier in a time period. The time period may include a day a week a month a year or the like.

Material object and restriction object are typically integrated by generating reference between material object and restriction object . In an embodiment reference is generated between a restriction name attribute for a material in material object and a restriction key of restriction condition in restriction object . In an embodiment reference is generated between a selection condition attribute of selection condition for a material in material object and a selection condition attribute of selection condition in restriction object . The integration of material object and restriction allows transparency between the two objects.

Supplier typically sends restriction note for a material in material object . Restriction note typically includes a material restriction for the material. For example the material restriction may include a maximum quantity restriction of 500 pieces per day for the material. One or more material positions having the material are typically searched in material object based on the material restriction. In an embodiment material object stores a unique material identifier for each material in material object . Material object is typically searched for material positions of the material using the material identifier of the material.

Selection conditions for each of material positions obtained as a result of searching are determined. Selection conditions typically define a condition based on which the material is chosen from a corresponding material position for the production of the product. Restriction condition is typically generated in restriction object for each selection condition based on the material restriction and selection condition determined from material object . In an embodiment restriction condition is generated by generating an association between the material restriction and each selection condition .

In material object maximum quantity of the product is typically determined based on the material restriction received from supplier . Material object generally stores a number of pieces of the material for each of material positions . The number of pieces is typically the number of pieces of the material used in the product. In an embodiment the maximum quantity of the product for a material position is determined from the number of pieces of the material in material position . For example if the number of pieces for a material in a material position is two and the material restriction is 100 pieces a day then the maximum quantity of the product is determined as 50 products a day.
