In some cases the search query may be broken down into single semantic units which may be recognized as tokens and or may be logically combined into compound semantic units which may recognized as tokens. The search query may include one or more tokens which in turn may represent one or more search terms. The search terms and or tokens in a search query may be recognized in various ways such as by using reference based approaches e.g. dictionaries databases statistical based approaches e.g. probability distributions proximity of words frequency of terms analysis of common search queries and or other suitable approaches in accordance with the described embodiments.

The search query may be evaluated to determine the presence of search terms and or tokens which may be expanded. In various embodiments evaluation of the search query involves determining whether the search query comprises an initial unit of measurement associated with a property and an initial numeric value for the initial unit of measurement. The determination may be made by analyzing the text string e.g. alphanumeric characters and or symbols search terms and or tokens of a search query to identify the presence of an initial unit of measurement associated with a property and an initial numeric value for the initial unit of measurement.

The unit of measurement UOM in a search query may be any unit defined by a unit of measurement system. One example of a unit of measurement system is the International System of Units SI that defines standard metric units. Another example of a unit of measurement system is the United States Customary System that defines U.S. customary units which are also referred to as English units Imperial units or standard units. The unit of measurement in the search query may be expressed as a full name or contracted form e.g. abbreviation symbol representing such units e.g. metric units U.S. customary units . The numeric value for the unit of measurement may be expressed as an integer decimal numeral fraction and or other type of number.

The unit of measurement may be associated with a property such as size rate time cost and so forth. The property associated with the unit of measurement may comprise for example a size such as length width thickness height distance area weight mass volume area data storage capacity clothing size or other dimension in accordance with the described embodiments. Exemplary units of measurement for size include without limitation kilometer km meter m centimeter cm millimeter mm mile mi yard yd feet ft inch in pound lb kilogram kg ounce oz ton T t cubic meter m cubic centimeter cc gallon gal quart qt pint pt ounce oz hectare ha square meter m acre square mile sq mi square feet ft sq ft terabyte TB gigabyte GB megabyte MB kilobyte KiB and others.

The property associated with the unit of measurement may comprise a rate such as such as speed velocity acceleration frequency data transfer rate fuel economy energy efficiency or other ratio in accordance with the described embodiments. Exemplary units of measurement for rate include without limitation kilometer per hour km h meter per second m s terahertz THz gigahertz GHz megahertz MHz Terabit per second Tbit s Tbps gigabit per second Gb s Gbps megabit per second Mbits s Mbps kilobit per second kbit s kb s kbps liters per 100 kilometers L 100 km kilometers per gallon km gal kilometers per liter kmpl miles per gallon mpg and others.

The property may comprise time such as age or other time period and the associated unit of measure may include year month day hour hr minute min second sec and others. The property may comprise a cost such as price value or other ratio and the associated unit of measurement may include for example currency such as U.S. dollar euro pound yen and others. It can be appreciated that in addition to the foregoing examples other suitable properties and or units defined by a unit of measurement system may be used in accordance with the described embodiments.

When the search query comprises a numeric value associated with a unit of measurement the numeric value and unit of measurement generally will be in close proximity to each other. For example in some cases a unit of measurement may immediately follow a numeric value e.g. 4 GB . In other cases the numeric value and the unit of measurement may be separated by a single space e.g. 3000 miles .

After identifying an initial unit of measurement associated with a property and an initial numeric value for the initial unit of measurement within the search query automatic expansion of the search query may be performed to form an expanded search query. In some cases the numeric value and the unit of measurement may comprise and or may be identified from a single search term or token. In other cases the numeric value and the unit of measurement may comprise and or may be identified by separate search terms or tokens. Forming the expanded search query may comprise expanding the search query to include at least one related unit of measurement associated with the property. In various implementations determining the related unit of measurement may involve performing aliasing and or unit of measurement conversion as described below.

In some embodiments the related unit of measurement may comprise an alias of the initial unit of measurement. In such embodiments the query expansion module may direct the query expansion server or other computing device to access the aliasing database . The aliasing database may comprise for example one or more lookup tables dictionaries or other suitable data structure to determine and return an alias or equivalent for the initial unit of measurement. In some usage scenarios a search query e.g. 3 ft audio cable may comprise an initial unit of measurement expressed as a standard or common abbreviation e.g. ft . In such scenarios aliasing of the initial unit of measurement may return a related unit of measurement comprising an alias e.g. feet of the abbreviation. The aliasing database may be configured to return the full name or other lengthened form of an initial unit of measurement in response to receiving an abbreviation or other contracted form e.g. symbol as well as to return an abbreviation or other contracted form of an initial unit of measurement in response to receiving a full name or other lengthened form.

In some embodiments aliasing may involve returning units of measurement translated into other languages e.g. kilometer to kilometro or kilom tre and or returning alternate spellings for units of measurements e.g. kilometer to kilometre . Aliasing also may involve returning more than one related unit of measurement including for example related units of measurement in more than one language e.g. km to kilometer and kilometro and or including alternate spellings e.g. km to kilometer and kilometre .

When aliasing is performed forming the expanded search query may comprise associating and or combining the related unit of measurement with the initial numeric value and or appropriately formatting e.g. positioning spacing etc. the associated or combined related unit of measurement and initial numeric value for inclusion within the expanded search query. For example the search query 3 ft audio cable may comprise an initial numeric value 3 and an initial unit of measurement ft . A related unit of measurement feet may be returned and associated with the initial numeric value and an appropriately formatted combination 3 feet may be generated for inclusion as one or more search terms or tokens within the expanded search query.

In addition to determining and returning an alias or equivalent for units of measurement the aliasing database also may be configured to determine and return an alias or equivalent for other search terms and or tokens of the search query. In such embodiments aliasing may involve returning search terms or tokens translated into one or more other languages and or returning alternate spellings for search terms or tokens in conjunction with unit of measurement conversion as described below.

In various implementations determining the related unit of measurement may involve performing unit of measurement conversion. In some embodiments the related unit of measurement may comprise a different unit of measurement associated with the property of the initial unit of measurement. In such embodiments the query expansion module may direct the query expansion server or other computing device to access the unit conversion database . The unit conversion database may comprise for example one or more lookup tables dictionaries or other suitable data structure to determine and return a related unit of measurement associated with the property of the initial unit of measurement.

The unit conversion database may be configured to return a different unit of measurement for the same property in response to receiving the initial unit of measurement an alias of the initial unit of measurement or an identifier associated with the initial unit of measurement. In some implementations for example the unit conversion database may be indexed by units in a particular format such as by the full name of a unit of measurement. It can be appreciated that indexing by the full name of a unit may be advantageous since many units of measurement may be abbreviated in numerous ways. The embodiments however are not limited in this context and the unit conversation database also may be indexed by common abbreviations for units of measurement. In some embodiments the unit conversion database may be indexed by identifiers associated with units of measurement.

In some usage scenarios the initial unit of measurement identified in the search query may be in the same format used by the unit conversion database to index units. For example when the unit conversion database is indexed by the full names of units and the initial unit of measurement comprises the full name of a unit of measurement e.g. kilometer the unit conversion database may return at least one related unit of measurement in response to the initial unit of measurement as presented in the search query.

However when the unit conversion database is indexed by full names of units and the initial unit of measurement comprises an abbreviation e.g. km an alias e.g. kilometer of the initial unit of measurement corresponding to the format used by the unit of conversion database may be determined. The unit conversion database then may return at least one related unit of measurement in response to the alias which in this case comprises the full name of the unit of measurement. It can be appreciated that aliasing from the full name of unit of measurement to an abbreviation may be required and or performed if the unit of conversion database is indexed by abbreviations and the initial unit of measurement comprises the full name of a unit of measurement.

In some embodiments the unit of conversion database may be indexed by identifiers associated with units. For example a single identifier may be mapped to the full name and or all abbreviations for the unit. In such embodiments an identifier associated with the initial unit of measurement may be determined and the unit conversion database may return at least one related unit of measurement in response to the identifier. In embodiments employing identifiers for units the unit of conversion database may be configured to return an identifier for the related unit of measurement which may be mapped to the full name and or abbreviations for the related unit of measurement.

When unit conversion is performed one or more related units of measurement may be determined. The one or more related units of measurement may comprise one or more different units of measurement associated with the property of the initial unit of measurement. Related units of measurements may comprise units defined by a unit of measurement system which is the same as and or different from the unit of measurement system that defines the initial unit of measurement. In some embodiments for example the initial unit of measurement may comprise a U.S. customary unit defined by the United States Customary System and the one or more related units of measurement may comprise one or more different U.S. customary units associated with the property of the initial unit of measurement. Alternatively or additionally the initial unit of measurement may comprise a U.S. customary unit and the one or more related units of measurement may comprise one or more different metric units defined by the International System of Units and associated with the property of the initial unit of measurement.

Unit conversion also may comprise mathematically converting the initial numeric value for the initial unit of measurement into a converted numeric value for the related unit of measurement. The mathematical conversion may be performed for example by the query expansion module based on the one or more related units of measurement which are provided in response to initial units of measurement. The mathematical conversion may involve generating one or more converted numeric values for the related unit of measurement. For example the query expansion module may comprise logic for outputting a converted numeric value in response to an initial numeric value an initial unit of measurement and a related unit of measurement. In some implementations the unit conversion database may supply the query expansion module with a conversion factor when returning a related unit of measurement. Each converted numeric value may be greater or less than the initial numeric value depending on the unit conversion and may be expressed as an integer decimal numeral fraction and or other type of number.

In some embodiments the converted numeric value may comprise a mathematically rounded value. For example the mathematical conversion may comprise calculating an exact value for the unit conversation and then mathematically rounding the exact value to generate the converted numeric value. Alternatively or additionally the converted numeric value may comprise or form part of a numeric value range. For example the mathematical conversion may comprise calculating an exact value and or rounded value for unit conversion from the initial unit of measurement to the related unit of measurement and then determining a numeric value range comprising the exact value and or rounded value to be used in the expanded search query. It can be appreciated that rounding the exact value and or calculating a numeric value range may be advantageous since the exact value or rounded value may be so specific as to overly restrict the expanded search query.

Forming the expanded search query may comprise associating and or combining each related unit of measurement with a corresponding converted numeric value and or appropriately formatting e.g. positioning spacing etc. the associated or combined related unit of measurement and corresponding converted numeric value for inclusion within the expanded search query. In some cases the converted numeric value and the corresponding related unit of measurement may comprise and or may be generated as a single search term or token. In other cases the converted numeric value and the corresponding related unit of measurement may comprise and or may be identified by separate search terms or tokens.

In some cases aliasing may be performed on the one or more related units of measurement. For example when the initial unit of measurement submitted in a search query comprises an abbreviation for a unit and the related unit of measurement comprises the full name of a unit aliasing may be employed to determine an abbreviation for the related unit of measurement for inclusion within the expanded search query. In such cases an alias of a related unit of measurement may be associated and or combined with a corresponding converted numeric value and the combination may be appropriately formatted for inclusion within the expanded search query. The converted numeric value and the corresponding alias of the related unit of measurement may comprise and or may be generated as a single search term or token or as separate search terms or tokens.

It can be appreciated that various combinations of aliasing and unit conversion may be performed in some embodiments. For example when a search query e.g. 3 ft audio cable comprises an initial unit of measurement e.g. ft and an initial numeric value e.g. 3 the related units of measurement may comprise an alias of the initial unit of measurement e.g. feet different units of measurement e.g. yard inch defined by a common unit of measurement system e.g. United States Customary System aliases of such units e.g. yd in converted numeric values for such units e.g. 1 36 different units of measurement e.g. meter centimeter defined by a different unit of measurement system e.g. International System of Units aliases of such units e.g. m cm and converted numeric values for such units e.g. 0.9144 91.44 which may be rounded e.g. 1 100 and or included in numeric value range e.g. 0.5 1.50 50 150 .

The related units of measurement which are provided in response to initial units of measurement may be predetermined or predefined from the perspective of users submitting search queries. That is when a user submits a search query comprising an initial unit of measurement one or more related units of measurement are determined and or mathematical conversions are performed automatically without the user needing to specify any parameters for performing unit of measurement conversion. The related units of measurement and or mathematical conversions may be provided according to the parameters of the query expansion module specified in advance by the network based system . In various embodiments the parameters of the query expansion module may be periodically updated by the network based system to modify and or optimize the related units of measurement and mathematical conversions which are provided in response to initial units of measurement. The related units of measurement and mathematical conversions which are provided may be updated for example based on popularity and or success of search queries. Accordingly in such embodiments the related units of measurement and or mathematical conversions which are provided in response to initial units of measurement may be dynamic from the perspective of users submitting search queries.

In some implementations the user may be notified that search expansion will be or has been performed so that the process is not completely transparent to the user. For example in some cases a search results page may include a notification that the search result is an expanded listing. In other cases the user may be allowed to set preferences for search query expansion. The user also may be presented with an opportunity to review an expanded search query and prompted to submit the expanded search query after review.

To further expand the search query in some embodiments at least one other search term within the search query other than the initial unit of measurement and the initial numeric value for the initial unit of measurement may be identified. After identifying the at least one other search term an alias of the at least one other search term may be determined. Determining the alias of the at least one other search term may involve for example translating the at least one other search term into one or more other languages. Such languages may include without limitation English e.g. US English UK English CA English French e.g. FR French CA French Spanish e.g. ES Spanish MX Spanish German Italian Japanese Chinese Hindi Arabic Portuguese Russian and so forth. In various implementations language translation of the at least one other search term may be performed in conjunction with performing unit conversion between different unit of measurement systems. For example when unit of conversion involves a different unit of measurement system used by different countries one or more search terms describing an item e.g. red convertible sports car may be translated into one or more languages of countries that use the different unit of measurement system.

The expanded search query may be formed by including at least one related unit of measurement to the search query. The expanded search query also may include a converted numeric value a numeric value range an alias of a related unit of measurement and or an alias of at least one other search term other than the initial unit of measurement and the initial numeric value in accordance with the described embodiments. One or more related units of measurement converted numeric values numeric value ranges and or aliases may be added to the search query for example as one or more additional alphanumeric characters and or symbols search terms and or tokens to be included along with the original alphanumeric characters and or symbols search terms and or tokens of the search query.

In various implementations the expanded search query may be sent to a search engine e.g. search engine server to search a database e.g. item database . The search engine may search the database and retrieve items from the database that satisfy the expanded search query. The search engine may aggregate the items that satisfy the expanded search query into a search result. The search result may be received by one or more client programs e.g. client programs and or one or more client devices e.g. client device to display within a user interface presented to a user. In some embodiments the search result may be presented within a user interface as a list of available goods for sale that satisfy an expanded search query. The embodiments however are not limited to this context.

As described above the network based system may communicate with users over one or more types of networks via interfaces provided the communications servers and provide various services to users such as online marketplace services via the application servers and databases . When servicing a user the network based system may present information to and or receive information from the user in a variety of ways such by displaying and receiving information via user interfaces e.g. web pages interactive screens sending and receiving messages e.g. e mail IM SMS MMS video message placing and or receiving telephone calls e.g. landline mobile VoIP IVR calls and so forth. User interfaces also may be displayed to a user via one or more client programs such as a web client e.g. web browser desktop or mobile widget web browser toolbar .

With reference to the user interface may be displayed by one or more of the client devices e.g. PC or mobile device and may be presented via a web browser and or a client side web application. It can be appreciated that the embodiments are not limited to this context or to this representation.

The user interface comprises a search engine interface implemented as a text entry box and a search button to commence a search based on a search query input into the text entry box . As shown the text entry box includes a search query from a user comprising an initial unit of measurement e.g. ft and an initial numeric value e.g. 3 . In response to activating the search button the search query is automatically expanded to form an expanded search query in accordance with the described embodiments. The expanded search query is then sent to a search engine to search a database.

In this representation a search result is received in response to the expanded search query that comprises a list of items that satisfy the expanded search query. It can be appreciated that the search result includes additional items beyond the constraints of the original search query that would not have been included without performing expansion of the search query. To retrieve such additional items would have required submitting a different search query which in turn would have provided a different search result. For example the description of an additional item may not include the initial numeric value. The different search result would have included a different list of items that may have eliminated other items of the search result . In accordance with the described embodiments however the user is provided with a relevant search result that comprises a more comprehensive list of items that may be of interest to the user in terms of price auction timing shipping location and so forth.
