In one type of fault tolerant system for each port one set of hardware called the command hardware or COM transmits and receives signals and another independent set of hardware called the monitor hardware or MON monitors the signals transmitted and received by the command hardware. For example in one such system a wrap back mechanism couples the transmitter of the COM hardware to a receiver in the MON hardware. Also in such a system for each port each received signal is delivered to two independent receivers one in the monitor hardware and one in the command hardware. Thus for each port such systems require three receivers and one transmitter one transmitter and one receiver in the command hardware and two receivers in the monitor hardware.

In some applications it is especially desirable to implement the physical layer of such a COM MON system using similar hardware for both the command hardware and the monitor hardware such that they use the same number of transmitters and receivers. However doing so typically leads to waste. illustrates the physical layer portion of a COM MON system that is implemented using the similar hardware for both the command and monitor hardware. In the example shown in a device comprises two ports . The device is implemented using two transceiver circuits one of which also referred to here as the COM IC is used to implement the command hardware for each port and the other of which also referred to here as the MON IC is used to implement the monitor hardware for each port . Each of the circuits and includes four transceivers each of which includes a respective transmitter and a respective receiver .

The one transmitter and one receiver needed to implement the COM portion for each port are implemented using a single one of the transceivers in the COM IC . The transmitter and receiver used to implement the COM portion for each port are coupled to the transmit portion and receive portion portion respectively of the communication channel to which that port is coupled.

The two receivers needed to implement the MON portion for each port are implemented using the receivers of two of the transceivers included in the MON IC . One of the receivers is coupled to the transmitter for the respective COM portion for that port using a wrap back link and the other receiver is coupled to the receive portion of the communication channel in order to receive data from the communication channel .

The design shown in uses similar hardware to implement the physical layer for each of the COM and MON portions for each port . However as shown in for each port of the device one entire transceiver in the COM IC and two transmitters in the MON IC are wasted where the wasted elements are marked with an X .

In one embodiment a communication device is provided. The communication device comprises first and second circuits to implement a plurality of ports via which the communicative device is operable to communicate over a plurality of communication channels. For each of the plurality of ports the communication device comprises command hardware that includes a first transmitter to transmit data over a respective one of the plurality of channels and a first receiver to receive data from the respective one of the plurality of channels and monitor hardware that includes a second receiver coupled to the first transmitter and a third receiver coupled to the respective one of the plurality of channels. The first circuit comprises the command hardware for a first subset of the plurality of ports. The second circuit comprises the monitor hardware for the first subset of the plurality of ports and the command hardware for a second subset of the plurality of ports.

In other words for each port with a command module located in circuit that command module is monitored by a corresponding monitor module in circuit . Similarly for each port with a command module located in circuit that command module is monitored by a corresponding monitor module in circuit .

For each port the transmitter in that port s command module is coupled to the transmit portion of the communication channel to which that port is coupled. Similarly for each port the receiver in that port s command module is coupled to the receive portion of the communication channel to which that port is coupled. Each port s monitor module has two receivers one coupled to the transmitter of the corresponding command module and another coupled to the receive portion of the communication channel to which that port is coupled.

Each communication channel is implemented using a suitable communication medium or media for example metallic communication media such as twisted pair cables coaxial cable and optical communication media such as fiber optic cables . In some embodiments each communication channel also uses suitably partitioned for example via code frequency space or time multiplexing radio frequency RF or free space optical paths. The transmit portion of each communication channel is the communication medium or media over which data is transmitted. Likewise the receive portion of each communication channel is the communication medium or media from which data is received. In some embodiments the transmit portion and the receive portion of the communication channel is implemented using a separate communication medium or media. For example in one embodiment where the communication channel is implemented using a copper twisted pair cable such as a category 5 CAT 5 cable one pair of copper wires included in the CAT5 cable is used for transmitting data and another pair of copper wires included in the CAT5 cable is used for receiving data.

In other embodiments the transmit portion and the receive portion of the communication channel are implemented using the same communication medium or media for example by using a multiplexing technique such as time division multiplexing frequency division multiplexing wave division multiplexing or code division multiplexing. In some embodiments each transmit portion and each receive portion of a communication channel uses multiple segments of media in parallel.

In some embodiments it is necessary for the circuit to communicate with circuit .

In such embodiments an inter chip link is used to facilitate the necessary communication between circuits and .

In addition in embodiments utilizing inter chip link a circuit having a monitor module is precluded from providing information via the inter chip link which influences the output of the command module being monitored. Similarly a circuit having a command module is precluded from providing information via the inter chip link which adversely impacts the ability of the corresponding monitor module to monitor the command module .
