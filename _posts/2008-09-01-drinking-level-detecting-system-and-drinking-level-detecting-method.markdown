The present invention relates to a drinking level detecting system and a drinking level detecting method for detecting the drinking level of a driver of a vehicle.

As a known device that detects the drinking level of a driver of a vehicle there is a device which detects the drinking level of a driver of a vehicle through the provision of an alcohol sensor in the vehicle as disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2004 249847. This device serves to prevent drunk driving by stopping an operation of a mechanism of the vehicle when the alcohol sensor exceeds a predetermined value.

In such a device however it is difficult to raise the accuracy of the drinking level. That is when the detection sensitivity is raised by setting the detection threshold value at which a determination of a drunken state is made to be high the rate of incorrect detection is increased. On the other hand when the incorrect detection rate is reduced by setting the detection threshold value at which a determination of a drunken state is made to be low the drinking level is undetected or overlooked. Accordingly the appropriate drinking level cannot be detected.

Therefore the present invention has been made in order to solve such a problem and it is an object of the present invention to provide a drinking level detecting system and a drinking level detecting method capable of improving the detection accuracy of the drinking level by allowing a third person to correct the drinking level of a driver.

According to the present invention the detection accuracy of the drinking level can be improved by allowing a third person to correct the drinking level of the driver.

Hereinafter embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. In addition the same elements are denoted by the same reference numerals in the drawing explanations and repeated explanation thereof is omitted.

As shown in a drinking level detecting system according to the present embodiment is a system that detects the drinking level of a driver of a vehicle and is provided in a restaurant . A drinking level acquisition section a drinking level correcting section a drinking level recording section and a drinking level issuing section are provided in the restaurant . The restaurant is a store which serves liquor and is a store to which the driver drives up to.

The drinking level acquisition section functions as a drinking level acquisition means for acquiring the drinking level of the driver of the vehicle. For example an alcohol detector is used. In this case by allowing the driver who ate and drank in the restaurant to breathe his or her breath on a detection portion of the drinking level acquisition section the drinking level of the driver is detected by the drinking level acquisition section and it is detected whether or not it exceeds the set alcohol concentration value.

The drinking level correcting section functions as a drinking level correction means for allowing a third person other than a driver to correct the drinking level detected by the drinking level acquisition section . For example it is provided so that the drinking level result can be corrected by the clerk of the restaurant . Specifically it is configured such that the drinking level result detected by the drinking level acquisition section can be corrected by the key operation of the clerk the operation of a button and the like.

In this case whether or not the operator is a clerk is checked on the basis of an ID a password or the like. Accordingly the drinking level correcting section also functions as a third person determination means since it has a function of determining whether or not a person who performs a correction operation is the third person other than the driver.

In addition the correction of the drinking level referred to herein is for example to correct a state where the driver is determined to be drunk to a state where the driver is determined not to be drunk. In addition the drinking level correcting section may function as a means for the operation equivalent to changing a non drinking level to a drinking level or release equivalent to changing a drinking level to a non drinking level of an alarm an interlock and the like.

The clerk of a restaurant is a third person who is responsible for drunk driving of a driver of a vehicle. For this reason corrections of the drinking level made by the clerk are very reliable. In addition since the clerk can correct the drinking level on the basis of the state of a driver and the driver s food and drink consumption an appropriate correction is possible. For example when it is detected by the drinking level acquisition section that the driver is drunk the clerk can correct the drinking level of the driver to a non drunken state if the driver is not under the influence of alcohol at all or if the driver has not drunk any liquor.

On the other hand when it is detected by the drinking level acquisition section that the driver is not drunk the clerk can correct the drinking level of the driver to a drunken state if the driver is clearly under the influence of alcohol or if the driver has been drinking liquor within a set time.

Thus since the drinking level of the driver can be appropriately corrected the detection accuracy of the drinking level of the driver can be improved.

The drinking level recording section records the drinking level information of the driver. For example a personal computer having a memory is used. The drinking level information recorded in the drinking level recording section is the corrected drinking level information when there was a correction by the drinking level correcting section and is drinking level information acquired in the drinking level acquisition section when there is no correction by the drinking level correcting section .

In addition the drinking and eating level recording section records an issuing number an issuing ID or a parking ID hereinafter referred to as issuing number and the like of a parking ticket issued in a parking lot of the restaurant and records the drinking level information of the driver so as to match the issuing number and the like.

In addition it is preferable that the drinking level recording section records the third person information for specifying the third person and the drinking level information so as to correspond with each other. For example information on the clerk who corrected the drinking level and the drinking level information are recorded so as to correspond with each other. Accordingly since an inappropriate determination of the clerk can be prevented when determining whether or not the driver is drunk the reliability of the determination can be improved.

The drinking level issuing section issues the drinking level information of the driver recorded in the drinking level recording section to the parking lot . As the drinking level issuing section for example a card reader writer which records the drinking level information on a parking ticket is used. When a parking ticket is issued in the parking lot the issuing number and the like are recorded on the parking ticket.

A parking lot facility a vehicle locking section and a drinking level reading section are provided in the parking lot . The parking lot is a parking lot of the store which serves liquor. In addition the parking lot may be a parking lot for exclusive use of the store and other stores. For example when the store is one store of a large commercial facility the parking lot may be a common parking lot of the large commercial facility.

The parking lot facility corresponds to an apparatus which issues a parking ticket to a vehicle that has entered the parking lot . As long as the issuing number and the like can be recorded on the parking ticket so that the drinking level information can be recorded any method such as a magnetic method may be used as a recording method. In addition as long as it is a medium in which the parking information the drinking level information and the like can be recorded and from which they can be read portable terminals such as mobile phones vehicle keys and the like other than the parking ticket may also be used.

The vehicle locking section functions as a preventing means for preventing a vehicle which does not satisfy the exit conditions set beforehand exiting from the parking lot . For example a wheel stopping type one which hooks the wheel of the vehicle or an outlet gate type one may be used. Cases where the exit conditions set beforehand are not satisfied could include for example a case where a driver of a vehicle is drunk or a case where the set parking fee is not paid.

The drinking level reading section writes the issuing number on a parking ticket or reads the drinking level information recorded on the parking ticket. For example an issuing device having card writing and reading functions is used.

The drunk driving prevention system has a good store point reporting function. When a drinking level is checked in the restaurant and the drinking level information is issued the good store point report information is transmitted to a restaurant information distribution server . In this case for example the drinking level issuing section and the restaurant information distribution server are connected to communicate with each other by a communication means such as the Internet so that the good store point report information can be transmitted and received. For example the restaurant information distribution server is provided in maintenance facilities managed by the police cities towns and villages and the like.

In addition the drunk driving prevention system has a good store information providing function. For example the good store point information distributed from the restaurant information distribution server is recorded in a good store information database . Search display order of the good store information recorded in the good store information database is determined in consideration of the good store point information.

Accordingly when searching restaurants through the Internet or the like by a search engine the restaurants with the high good store points are preferentially displayed on the search result list. For this reason it is possible to prevent the restaurant side from refraining from introducing the drunk driving prevention system according to the present embodiment.

Next operations of the drinking level detecting system and drunk driving prevention system according to the present embodiment and the drinking level detecting method according to the present embodiment will be described.

The entrance processing in the drunk driving prevention system shown in is repeatedly executed at predetermined periods by the parking lot facility and the drinking level reading section for example.

As shown in S of it is determined whether or not a vehicle has entered. This determination is preferably performed on the basis of a detection signal of a sensor which detects the entrance of a vehicle. When it is determined that there is no entrance of a vehicle in S the entrance processing is ended. On the other hand when it is determined that a vehicle has entered in S lock processing of the vehicle is performed S . This lock processing is processing of locking the exit of a vehicle by the vehicle locking section . For example the exit of a vehicle is prevented by a wheel stopper a gate or the like without outputting a lock release signal to the vehicle locking section .

Then the process proceeds to S in which parking ticket issuing processing is performed. The parking ticket issuing processing is processing of issuing a parking ticket on which the issue number and the like are recorded and is performed by the parking lot facility for example. Then the process proceeds to S in which parking information transmission processing is performed. The parking information transmission processing is processing of transmitting the issuing number information of the parking lot to the restaurant . When the parking information transmission processing is finished the control processing series of the entrance processing is ended.

By performing the entrance processing the vehicle that has entered the parking lot can be locked and the parking information corresponding to the vehicle can be transmitted to the restaurant .

The drinking level detection processing in the drinking level detecting system shown in is repeatedly executed at predetermined periods by the drinking level detecting system .

As shown in S of parking information receiving processing is performed. This parking information receiving processing is processing of receiving and recording the parking information transmitted from the parking lot . For example the parking information is recorded in the drinking level recording section .

Then the process proceeds to S in which it is determined whether or not the food bill has been paid. For this determination processing it is preferable to input an input signal of a cash register or the like to the drinking level detecting system and to determine whether or not the food bill has been paid on the basis of the input signal. When it is determined that the food bill has not been paid in S the control processing series of the drinking level detection processing is ended. On the other hand when it is determined that the food bill has been paid in S sobriety test processing is performed S . The sobriety test processing is processing of testing the drinking level of the driver with a sobriety testing device such as an alcohol detector and of inputting the test result.

Then the process proceeds to S in which the drinking level information and the parking information such as the issuing number of the parking lot are recorded. It is preferable that the information on whether or not the driver is drunk be recorded in the drinking level information. The parking information is preferably recorded by reading the information of the parking ticket by a card reader or the like.

Then the process proceeds to S in which it is determined whether or not the drinking level information has been corrected. For example it is determined whether or not the drinking level information has been corrected to the non drunken state when the test result indicated the drunken state or it is determined whether or not the drinking level information has been corrected to the drunken state when the test result indicated the non drunken state.

It is determined by the third person other than the driver for example by the clerk of the restaurant whether to correct the drinking level information. In this case it is preferable that the information regarding corrections of the drinking level information and the information on the third person who made the correction be recorded so as to correspond with each other. Accordingly since the corrected record and the person who made the correction become clear the reliability of the drinking level determination of the third person can be improved.

When it is determined that there was no correction in the drinking level information in S the process proceeds to S. On the other hand when it is determined that there was a correction in the drinking level information in S the information regarding corrections of the drinking level information is recorded S . Then the process proceeds to S in which the drinking level information and the parking information are transmitted to the side of the parking lot . When the transmission processing of S is finished the control processing series of the drinking level detection processing is ended.

According to the drinking level detection processing since the drinking level detected by the alcohol detector can be corrected by the third person other than the driver the drinking level can be corrected after ensuring reliability by the determination of the third person even when the drinking level detected by the alcohol detector is incorrect. As a result the detection accuracy of the drinking level can be improved.

In addition since the drinking level can be corrected by the third person who is responsible for preventing the driver from drunk driving for example by the clerk of the restaurant the reliability of the detection result of the drinking level can be improved. In this case the drinking level may also be corrected by the fellow passenger of the vehicle as a third person who is responsible for preventing the driver from drunk driving. Also in this case since the third person who is responsible for preventing the driver from drunk driving corrects the information the reliability of the detection result of the drinking level can be improved.

In addition the reliability of the determination of the third person can be improved by recording the third person information for specifying the third person and the information regarding corrections of the drinking level so as to correspond with each other.

The exit processing in the drunk driving prevention system shown in is repeatedly executed at predetermined periods by the drinking level reading section of the parking lot for example.

As shown in S of receiving processing of the parking information such as the issuing number and the drinking level information is performed. This receiving processing is processing of receiving the parking information and the drinking level information transmitted from the side of the restaurant and of receiving the information so as to correspond with each other.

Then the process proceeds to S in which it is determined whether a parking ticket was input. For example when the driver inserts a parking ticket in the parking lot facility and the information recorded on the parking ticket is read it is determined that a parking ticket was input. On the other hand when the information recorded on the parking ticket is not read it is determined that there is no input of a parking ticket.

When it is determined that there is no input of a parking ticket in S the control processing series of the exit processing is ended. On the other hand when it is determined that a parking ticket was input in S the issue number of the parking ticket and the like are read and the drinking level information corresponding thereto is read.

Then the process proceeds to S in which it is determined whether or not the driver can drive on the basis of the drinking level information. For example when the driver is in a drunken state it is determined that the driver cannot drive. On the other hand when the driver is in a non drunken state it is determined that the driver can drive.

When it is determined that the driver can drive in S lock release processing is performed S . This lock release processing is processing of releasing the lock of the vehicle locking section . For example a lock release signal is input to the vehicle locking section such that the vehicle can exit. Accordingly the driver in the non drunken state can drive the vehicle to exit from the parking lot .

On the other hand when it is determined that the driver cannot drive in S the lock release is not performed S . For example the lock release signal is not input to the vehicle locking section such that the vehicle cannot exit. Accordingly the driver in the drunken state cannot drive the vehicle. As a result drunk driving is prevented.

According to such exit processing drunk driving can be reliably prevented because lock release of the vehicle of the drunk driver is not performed. In this case since the drinking level of the driver is detected and corrected by the determination of the third person incorrect detection or non detection is reduced. As a result the drinking level of the driver is accurately detected. Therefore appropriate drunk driving prevention measures can be taken according to the drinking level.

The good point recording processing in the drunk driving prevention system shown in is repeatedly executed at predetermined periods by the restaurant information distribution server for example.

As shown in S of it is determined whether or not there was input of the usage information regarding the drinking level detecting system. For example when there was input of the good store point report information it is determined that there was input of the usage information regarding the drinking level detecting system. On the other hand when there is no input of the good store point report information it is determined that there is no input of the usage infatuation regarding the drinking level detecting system.

When it is determined that there is no input of the usage information regarding the drinking level detecting system in S the control processing is ended. On the other hand when it is determined that there was input of the usage information regarding the drinking level detecting system in S the good store points are counted up for the restaurant S and the good store point of the restaurant are transmitted to the good store information database S .

According to the good store point recording processing when the drinking level detecting system or the drunk driving prevention system is used in a restaurant the good store points of the restaurant are counted up and recorded. For this reason since the restaurant receives a better evaluation with increased use of the drinking level detecting system or the drunk driving prevention system active use of the drinking level detecting system or the drunk driving prevention system can be promoted.

The search priority setting processing in the drunk driving prevention system shown in is repeatedly executed at predetermined periods by the good store information database for example.

As shown in S of it is determined whether or not the good store point information has been received S . When the good store point information has been received search priority calculation is performed S . The search priority calculation is processing of calculating the search priority considering the good store points for a store which has received good store points. For example the calculation is performed such that the search priority becomes high for a store which has received good store points.

Then search priority setting processing is performed S . This setting processing is processing of setting the display priority of search results in consideration of the good store point information. For example when the conditions other than the good store point are equal a store with high good store points is preferentially displayed as the search result.

According to the search priority setting processing the display priority of search results when performing searching using the Internet or the like is set according to the good store points of the store. For this reason active use of the drinking level detecting system or the drunk driving prevention system can be promoted.

As described above according to the drinking level detecting system and drinking level detecting method according to the present embodiment since the drinking level detected by the alcohol detector can be corrected by the third person other than the driver the drinking level can be corrected after ensuring reliability by the determination of the third person even when the drinking level detected by the alcohol detector is incorrect. As a result the detection accuracy of the drinking level can be improved.

In addition since the drinking level can be corrected by the third person who is responsible for preventing the driver from drunk driving of for example by the clerk of the restaurant or the fellow passenger of the vehicle the reliability of the detection result of the drinking level can be improved.

In addition the reliability of the determination of the third person can be improved by recording the third person information for specifying the third person and the information regarding corrections of the drinking level so as to correspond with each other.

In addition according to the drunk driving prevention system according to the present embodiment drunk driving can be reliably prevented because lock release of the vehicle of the drunk driver is not performed. In this case since the drinking level of the driver is detected and corrected under the determination of the third person incorrect detection or non detection is reduced. As a result the drinking level of the driver is accurately detected. Therefore appropriate drunk driving prevention measures can be taken according to the drinking level.

In addition the above embodiments describe best embodiments of the drinking level detecting system and drinking level detecting method of the present invention and the drinking level detecting system and the drinking level detecting method according to the present invention are not limited to those described in the present embodiment. As for the drinking level detecting system and the drinking level detecting method according to the present invention the drinking level detecting system according to the embodiment may be modified or may be applied to other things without departing from the scope of the present invention as defined in the appended claims.

For example although the case where the drinking level acquisition section and the drinking level correcting section are provided in the restaurant and the vehicle locking section is provided in the parking lot has been described in the above embodiment the drinking level acquisition section the drinking level correcting section and the vehicle locking section may be provided in the vehicle. For example it may be detected whether or not the driver is drunk by a drinking level acquisition section such as an alcohol detector provided in the vehicle and the third person determined as a third person by personal authentication or the like may correct the detection result by a switching operation or the like.

In addition the drinking level correcting section may be provided in the management center. For example the drinking level information acquired by the drinking level acquisition section is transmitted to the management center and is recorded. In addition a configuration where the drinking level can be corrected by an operator who is a third person of the management center is also possible.

According to the present invention the detection accuracy of the drinking level can be improved by allowing a third person to correct the drinking level of the driver.
