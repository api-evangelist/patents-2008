The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government without payment therefor.

This application is related to inventor s application titled Spherically Shaped Optical Beamsplitter filed on even date.

The invention relates to optical elements and methods. More specifically the invention relates to an optical beamsplitter that can be used to propagate optical signals.

A beamsplitter is an optical device that receives an incident light beam and divides it into two components. The first component is propagated from the beamsplitter as a transmitted beam. The second component is propagated as a reflected optical beam angularly displaced from the transmitted beam.

A conventional beamsplitter comprises a cube of optically transparent material encasing a thin layer of semi reflecting material oriented diagonally across the interior. About one half of the light entering a face of the beamsplitter is reflected by the semi reflecting material through an adjacent face as a reflected light beam. The remaining portion of the incident light beam is transmitted by the layer of semi reflecting material through the opposite face as a transmitted light beam.

Beamsplitters are used in optical devices such as scanners interferometers and back scattering detectors for measuring back scatter from particles. A problem associated with conventional cubic beamsplitters is distortion caused by light striking faces at oblique i.e. non perpendicular angles. Transmission through the beamsplitter is refracted at the surface according to Fresnel s Equations. The refracted light beam is parallel to the incident beam and displaced from it. The magnitude of displacement depends on the angle of incidence and the index of retraction of optical materials in beamsplitter components. This distortion may be compensated for to some extent by repositioning components in an optical system.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 411 441 to Gorden Videen discloses a Beamsplitter Prism with Cylindrical Faces for Transmitting or Reflecting Cylindrical Waves Without Magnification.

A cylindrically shaped optical beamsplitter system and method are provided. An optical beamsplitter comprises an optically transparent material and a partially reflective layer. The optically transparent material has a first end a second end and a cylindrically shaped exterior surface extending between the first end and the second end. The first end second end and cylindrically shaped exterior surface define an interior. The partially reflective layer is positioned at least partially within the interior.

A method for using an optical beamsplitter for scanning a sample is provided. The beamsplitter includes an optically transparent material having a cylindrically shaped exterior surface and a partially reflective layer contained therein. The method comprising the steps of 

Other devices systems methods features and or advantages will be apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following drawings and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional devices systems methods features and or advantages be included within this description.

A cylindrically shaped optical beamsplitter system and method are provided. The portion of the exterior surface of the beamsplitter that directs light is substantially cylindrically shaped. As a result advantages are achieved. For example light incident upon the beamsplitter is received at an angle normal to the exterior surface of the beamsplitter. Light propagated from the beamsplitter can be transmitted at an angle normal to the exterior surface. Therefore at least some of the light received and transmitted is propagated without distortion.

Reference is made to the drawing. is a schematic diagram showing a cylindrically shaped optical beamsplitter. Beamsplitter is made of a material that is optically transparent with respect to at least one wavelength of light. For example glass quartz plastic and epoxy are optically transparent to visible light. Quartz is transparent to ultraviolet light. Silicon and germanium are transparent to infrared light. The optically transparent material may be optically transparent for more than one wavelength of light.

The exterior surface of the material is defined by first and second ends that are generally planar and oppose each other. Portion of the exterior surface that extends a length I between the first and second ends is defined by a substantially constant radius r extending from longitudinal axis L. In another embodiment ends may be other than planar and or cat be oriented differently than specifically shown.

Beamsplitter also includes a partially reflective layer which is oriented generally within a plane that intersects center C. Two orthogonal axes longitudinal axis L and transverse axis T extend outwardly from center C. In the L T plane in which layer is oriented is parallel to the X Y plane.

The partially reflective layer is formed of one or more materials known in the art for this use. In the partially reflective layer is continuous and extends across the optically transparent material. Partially reflective layer extends across the optically transparent material so that its outer periphery is adjacent to the exterior surface . In another embodiment the partially reflective layer is discontinuous. The partially reflective layer may not extend to or in the alternative may extend beyond the exterior surface of the beamsplitter.

In transmitted ray is incident upon an object not shown that provides a back scattered ray to the beamsplitter. For ease of illustration both the transmitted ray and back scattered ray are shown parallel to and laterally offset from each other. In reality these rays are co extensive.

Back scattered ray is received by the beamsplitter and is incident upon an opposing face of the partially reflective layer . A component of the back scattered ray is then reflected as a second reflected ray that is propagated from the beamsplitter. Although not shown in the partially reflective layer may transmit another component of the back scattered ray . The ray shown is normal to the corresponding portion of the exterior surface of the beamsplitter to which it is incident.

Reference is made to . Optical system includes a beamsplitter incorporating a partially reflective layer . Light source provides light to optional input optics which focuses light passed to the beamsplitter. The input optics can include a lens.

Light incident upon the beamsplitter shown as an incident ray is passed through the beamsplitter to the partially reflective layer . A component of the incident ray is transmitted through the beamsplitter as transmitted ray . The component of the incident ray reflected by the partially reflective layer is not shown. Transmitted ray is directed toward sample that scatters incident light. A component of the scattered light comes back to the beamsplitter as back scattered ray . Back scattered ray is then reflected by the partially reflective layer . Back scattered reflected ray provided to optional output optics . Output optics can include one or more lenses for focusing the reflected back scattered ray . The back scattered reflected ray is then provided to detector that analyzes the light. For example the detector can be an electronic detector such as a photomultiplier tube PMT a photodiode PDA or a charge coupled device CCD . Detector can be a non electronic detector such as photosensitive film or a human eye. The component of the back scattered ray that is not reflected by partially reflective layer is not shown in .

Optical system also includes controller and rotation mechanism used to rotate beamsplitter with respect to at least one axis of rotation. Rotation mechanism contacts the beamsplitter so that movement of the rotation mechanism rotates the beamsplitter. As shown in Controller provides an input signal to rotation mechanism to cause rotation as indicated by arrow A. In response beamsplitter rotates as indicated by arrow B. The rotation mechanism can be configured so that the beamsplitter can be rotated with respect to more than one axis. The beamsplitter can also be rotated with the light source.

The opposing ends of a cylindrically shaped beamsplitter are not used for propagating light. Therefore unlike the embodiment shown in in which the rotation mechanism contacts the cylindrically shaped portion of the exterior surface the ends can be used to attach a rotation mechanism.

Another embodiment of an optical system is a variation of that shown in . What is different is that the position of both light source and input optics is exchanged with the position of both detector and output optics . As beamsplitter is rotated incident light from the source scans object . Backscattered light from object is transmitted to the output optics and detector.

The optical system of is described with reference to the flowchart of . The method begins at block where a cylindrically shaped optical beamsplitter is shown. In block the beamsplitter is rotated with respect to at least one axis of rotation to a first orientation. In block the beamsplitter is used to acquire information corresponding to the first orientation. When the beamsplitter is used in conjunction with an array of photodiodes the information can correspond to amount or intensity of the reflected back scattered light incident upon the photodiodes during an exposure period.

An embodiment of an optical system including a cylindrically shaped optical beamsplitter is shown in . Optical system includes a beamsplitter incorporating a partially reflective layer . An external light source not shown illuminates sample . A portion of the light provided by the external source is incident upon the sample with some of the incident light scattered back to the beamsplitter. Scattered ray is scattered from the sample to the beamsplitter . The scattered ray is then reflected by the partially reflective layer with a scattered reflected ray provided to a detector via optional output optics .

Many variations and modifications may be made to the above described embodiments. All such modifications and variations are intended to be included within the scope of the invention as defined by the following claims.
