The computers discussed above whether those mentioned with respect to the hospital environment or those mentioned with respect to the ambulance environment may each be configured to employ using their processor statistical analysis on data such as a value of a parameter baseline a varying baseline a trend and or a varying trend in order to determine a Z score for any of the above data. The Z score sometimes referred to as a standard score indicates how many standard deviations the data is above or below a mean namely compare the COwaveforms which are sampled to a standard normal distribution which is either predetermined and programmed into the computer or is learned on the fly during the monitoring of the pertinent patient.

Advantageously the Z score may enhance the diagnosis of the type and or degree of severity of a medical condition of the patient for example by indicating the statistical significance of each suspected diagnosis. This may assist in eliminating or mitigating noise artifacts in the COwaveforms and or in providing the caregiver a measure of the certainty of the medical indication provided by the computer. This may be useful whether the computer indicates a single diagnosis and its computed likelihood or multiple possible diagnoses and their likelihoods so that the caregiver can reach an educated decision.

For further discussion of Z score analysis and computation see Richard J. Larsen and Morris L. Marx 3ed. 2005 incorporated herein by reference.
