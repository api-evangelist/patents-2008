title: Map service with network-based query for search
abstract: On a mobile device a “live” network-based query for search is performed (e.g., performed automatically) in response to a map display update or other trigger event. In some implementations, when the map display is updated (or other trigger event occurs) a network-based map service is queried to obtain information related to the current location of the mobile device. The information can be presented on the map display. In some implementations, when multiple search results matching the query are provided by the map service, a confirmation request is presented on the mobile device to allow the user to select a search result. The selected search result (e.g., a destination) can be presented on the map display. A route from the current location of the mobile device to a destination can be drawn on the map display.

The role of traditional printed maps is being supplanted by modern devices capable of rendering dynamic map displays. Devices that include mapping or navigation applications provide information regarding an area selected by a user by recalling map data from local memory or networked services. When coupled with any of a number of positioning technologies a mapping device can display a current position on a map and deliver navigation instructions based on the current position to route a user to a desired destination. Positioning technologies include satellite positioning systems such as the Global Positioning System GPS cell tower triangulation and network based positioning systems e.g. Wi Fi positioning system .

On a mobile device a live network based query for search is performed e.g. performed automatically in response to a map display update or other trigger event. In some implementations when the map display is updated or other trigger event occurs a network based map service is queried to obtain information related to the current location of the mobile device. The information can be presented on the map display. In some implementations when multiple search results matching a query are provided by the map service a confirmation request is presented on the mobile device to allow the user to select a search result.

A camera subsystem and an optical sensor e.g. a charged coupled device CCD or a complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS optical sensor can be utilized to facilitate camera functions such as recording photographs and video clips.

Communication functions can be facilitated through one or more wireless communication subsystems which can include radio frequency receivers and transmitters and or optical e.g. infrared receivers and transmitters. The specific design and implementation of the communication subsystem can depend on the communication network s over which the mobile device is intended to operate. For example a mobile device may include communication subsystems designed to operate over a GSM network a GPRS network an EDGE network a Wi Fi or WiMax network and a Bluetooth network.

The user may be able to customize a functionality of one or more of the buttons. The touch screen can for example also be used to implement virtual or soft buttons and or a keyboard.

In some implementations the mobile device can present recorded audio and or video files such as MP3 AAC and MPEG files. In some implementations the mobile device can include the functionality of an MP3 player such as an iPod . The mobile device may therefore include a 30 pin connector that is compatible with the iPod . Other input output and control devices can also be used.

The memory interface can be coupled to memory . The memory can include high speed random access memory and or non volatile memory such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices one or more optical storage devices and or flash memory e.g. NAND NOR . The memory can store an operating system such as Darwin RTXC LINUX UNIX OS X WINDOWS or an embedded operating system such as VxWorks. The operating system may include instructions for handling basic system services and for performing hardware dependent tasks. In some implementations the operating system can be a kernel e.g. UNIX kernel .

In some implementations the media processing instructions are divided into audio processing instructions and video processing instructions to facilitate audio processing related processes and functions and video processing related processes and functions respectively. An activation record and International Mobile Equipment Identity IMEI or similar hardware identifier can also be stored in memory .

Each of the above identified instructions and applications can correspond to a set of instructions for performing one or more functions described above. These instructions need not be implemented as separate software programs procedures or modules. The memory can include additional instructions or fewer instructions. Furthermore various functions of the mobile device may be implemented in hardware and or in software including in one or more signal processing and or application specific integrated circuits.

The mobile device can for example receive a communication A from an access point e.g. a Wi Fi access point . The communication A can include information about the access point e.g. the Internet Protocol IP address and or the Media Access Control MAC address of the access point . The communication A can include other information such as the latitude and longitude of the access point . The information received in communication A can be sent to the location based service in communication B. The location based service can for example with a degree of uncertainty or error estimate a first geographic area in which the mobile device is currently located using the information sent in communication B. In some implementations the location based service is a system or service that estimates with some degree of uncertainty or error the position of a device using a database of access points mapped to geographic locations. The accuracy or precision or the degree of uncertainty or error of the estimated position can for example be based on the range of the technology the accuracy of the range or some other metric. Accuracy or precision of an estimated position can be affected by one or more factors including for example inherent properties or limitations of the technology or system and a level of deployment of the given technology or system e.g. number of access points or cell towers in the vicinity of the device .

In some implementations the accuracy or precision of the estimated position is stated in units of distance e.g. the estimated position is accurate up to 50 meters . That is the actual position of the mobile device can be within the accuracy distance from the estimated position. For example the first geographic area can be a circle centered at the latitude and longitude of the estimated position with a radius equal to the stated accuracy or precision e.g. 38 meters if the accuracy of the estimated position is up to 38 meters . The first geographic area can alternatively be represented on a map display as a square rectangle oval diamond triangle or some other shaped enclosed region.

In some other implementations unique signatures of multiple access points e.g. five or more can be compared to a local cache on the mobile device or a central reference database at location based service via network communication e.g. communication B can be sent to the location based service . The location based service can use the unique signatures to estimate the latitude and longitude of the center of the first geographic circle with an m meter radius e.g. about 20 meters .

In some implementations location based service includes positioning services and reference database information provided by SKYHOOK WIRELESS of Boston Mass.

The mobile device can receive a communication A from cell tower . The cell communication A can include for example information identifying the cell tower . In some implementations the cell communication A can also include the latitude and longitude of the cell tower . The identifying information and or the latitude and longitude of the cell tower can be sent to the location based service in communication B. The location based service can estimate a position of the mobile device using the information included in communication B and estimate an accuracy of the estimate position. Thus for example the location based service can estimate a second geographic area in which the mobile device is currently located. In some implementations the second geographic area is represented on a map as a circular region centered at the estimated position and with a radius equal to the accuracy of the estimated position. In some other implementations the second geographic area can represented on a map by a square or rectangular shaped enclosed region to name a few additional examples.

In some implementations the position and the geographic area of the mobile device can be estimated using a cell of origin positioning technology. In some other implementations the second geographic area can be determined by cell tower triangulation.

The first and second geographic areas can be sent to the mobile device by communications and respectively. The mobile device can present on the touch sensitive display for example a map view including an indication of one of the geographic areas if that one is entirely contained within the other geographic area including the case where the boundaries of the geographic areas touch but otherwise no part of the one of the geographic area is outside of the other geographic area . For example a map view that includes an indication of the first geographic area can be presented if the first geographic area is completely contained within the second geographic area. The mobile device can present a map view that includes an indication of the second geographic area if the first geographic area is not completely contained within the second geographic area. For example if the technology system or service used to estimate the first geographic area has a greater level of accuracy or precision detail than the technology system or service used to estimate the second geographic area and the first geographic area is determined to be more accurate or precise based on the first geographic area being entirely within the second geographic area the mobile device can use the first geographic area. The level of detail of the technology can for example be determined by a priority table stored in the mobile device .

In another example the first geographic area can be estimated using the access point and the second geographic area can be estimated using the cell tower . In this example the access point was moved from its original location and the latitude and longitude coordinates of the access point as they are known to location based service are incorrect and the mobile device is not actually located within the first geographic area. The cell tower provided correct location based data and the mobile device is located within the second geographic area. In this situation the first and second geographic areas do not overlap so the mobile device would display a map view indicating the second geographic area. The mobile device can be used to determine the accuracy of the first and second geographic areas or an external server or servers can be used.

The location based service and location based service can run on the same device or on separate devices. For example the location based services and can run on servers communicating with the mobile device through a network e.g. WAN . The servers can be separate servers or the same server. The location based services and can alternatively run on the mobile device .

The mobile device can for example connect to additional devices or services not shown for location based services instead of or in addition to the access point and the cell tower . Such devices or services could include a Bluetooth device GPS radio or TV towers or cellular grids to name a few examples. For example the mobile device can connect to peer devices with the Bluetooth communication device and receive location based information from other mobile devices and or Bluetooth enabled devices. In some implementations the mobile device can determine or estimate its position and or geographic area using other technologies e.g. GPS . In some implementations the geographic area determined or estimated using any of these other technologies can be used e.g. displayed in lieu of the geographic area estimated using location based services or e.g. Wi Fi or cellular positioning techniques if the geographic area determined or estimated using the other technologies is contained entirely within the geographic area estimated using location based services or and if the other technologies are more accurate or precise according to the priority table stored in the mobile device .

The search bar can be used to find an address or other location on the map. For example a user can enter their home address in the search bar and the region containing the address would be displayed on the map . The bookmarks list object can for example bring up a Bookmarks list which contains addresses that are frequently visited such as a user s home address. The Bookmarks list can also for example contain special bookmarks such as the current location e.g. the current location of the mobile device .

The search object can be used to display the search bar and other map related search menus. The directions object can for example bring up a menu interface that allows the user to enter a start and end location and then displays information for a route from the start location to the end location e.g. directions and travel time. The map view object can bring up a menu that will allow the user to select display options for the map . An example of a menu that can be displayed when map view is selected is further described below in reference to . The map could be changed from black and white to color the background of the map could be changed or the user could change the brightness of the map to name a few examples.

The current location object can allow the user to see a geographic area on the map indicating where the device is currently located. The special current location bookmark can be placed in the Bookmarks list when the current location object is selected. If the special current location bookmark was previously set in the Bookmarks list the old bookmark information can for example be replaced with the new current location information. In some implementations the special current location bookmark is tied to the centroid of the geographic area . That is the special current location bookmark includes the address for the centroid of the geographic area . The geographic area can be based on location data determined or estimated using location based services or or some other location data such as the data previously described in reference to . The geographic area can for example be depicted by a circle rectangle square or other enclosed region with crosshairs or some other distinctive element to differentiate the geographic area from the map .

In some implementations the geographic area indicates a region in which the mobile device is determined or estimated to be located and the geographic area may not necessarily be centered on the actual current position of the mobile device . In this example the mobile device may be located off center within the geographic area. In another example the geographic area can be centered on an estimated current position of the mobile device .

The mobile device can for example center the map view on the geographic area when the current location object is tapped or otherwise selected. In some implementations the zoom level of the map can be adjusted based on the accuracy or precision of the location data or the technology system or service that provided the location data. For example the map can be zoomed in for higher accuracy GPS location data and zoomed out for lower accuracy cell tower or Wi Fi location data. In another implementation the zoom level can be based on the velocity of the mobile device e.g. the map can be zoomed out at higher velocities and zoomed in when the mobile device is not moving. A combination of accuracy or precision and velocity can also be used. If all methods for retrieving location based data fail e.g. both location based service A and location based service B fail and there are no other systems or services available for determining or estimating the current position of the mobile device an error can be displayed to the user and no geographic area is displayed on the map . The error can for example contain a message to the user informing them of the failure and the possible reason for the failure.

The current location object can be selected for example to activate the estimation and displaying of the geographic area on the map to get directions to or from the estimated current location i.e. the centroid of the geographic area to send the estimated current location of the mobile device to a friend e.g. so that the friend can go to the same location or to create a bookmark for the estimated current location to name a few examples.

The circle outlining the geographic area can for example have animation or be motionless. The circle can for example change color e.g. user defined colors or pre programmed colors on the mobile device change distinctive features e.g. switch between crosshairs and ticks or have moving distinctive features e.g. the ticks change position . The circle could for example have white space overlaid on top of the map directly around the perimeter or some combination of features. In some implementations the contrast of the circle s color oscillates or pulses to differentiate the circle from the map .

In some implementations the geographic area can be based on data from the most recent query to the Wi Fi base station device . The geographic area could also for example be based on historical data of where the mobile device recently was located. For example if the geographic area was last updated a short time before the newest activation the previous location can be used to identify the new location. Continuing the example if the previous current location showed that the user is in California but the new location 30 minutes later would show a current location in Florida an error can be displayed on the mobile device .

For example the first geographic area from can be determined using access points and the second geographic area from can be determined by cell tower . If the first geographic area is determined to be wholly contained within the second geographic area the first geographic area can be used as geographic area and be presented on the mobile device . If the first geographic area is determined to be at most partially contained within the second geographic area the second geographic area could be used as geographic area and be presented on the mobile device .

Some examples of the first geographic area being at most partially contained within the second geographic area include the access point being moved or the access point and the cell tower having a partial overlap of geographic areas e.g. the first geographic area is on the edge and partially outside of the second geographic area . Other examples of the cause of geographic areas and being different would be for other positioning technologies systems or services that have varying levels of accuracy or precision such as a GPS and a radio tower.

In some implementations the scaling of the map can be different based on the geographic area selected the technology system service used to determine or estimate the geographic area or some other requirement. For example if the first geographic area determined using access points as described above is selected to be presented as the geographic area from the scaling can be larger than if the second geographic area determined using cell tower was selected to be presented as geographic area . The scaling of the map can for example stay the same when the current location object is selected. Continuing the example if the default zoom level determined to be used on the mobile device is close to the currently used zoom level the zoom level can remain unchanged e.g. if the default level is a street zoom and the current zoom level in on a city view no change is made. If the current zoom level is a state view and the default level is a street view the map can for example be changed to a street view.

The line width of the circle around the geographic area can be changed based on the zoom level or the line width can stay the same. For example the line width can get larger or smaller when zooming in closer to the map. The change to the line width and or to lengths of the crosshairs tick marks or the like on the circle can be based on an exponential algorithm a linear algorithm or some other algorithm.

The start location and end location can be swapped with a switch object . For example the switch object can be used to make the end location the new start location and the start location the new end location.

In some implementations the user can for example remove the current location bookmark from the start location if a different start location is desired with a remove start location object . Alternatively the user can manually enter a new location as the start location using the keyboard . In other implementations the user can select the current location bookmark or another location bookmark from the Bookmarks list as the start location. The remove start location object can be replaced with a start bookmarks list object not shown similar to the end bookmarks list object if the start location is empty. Once the start location and end location have been entered the route object can be selected and directions and optionally other information for a route from the start location to the end location can be displayed on the map e.g. the map .

Referring to the user has entered Camer in the search bar . The search resulted in multiple unique search results Camer United Kingdom and Camer France. In some implementations multiple search results can be presented to the user on the touch sensitive display and the user can be prompted to select a result using a touch or gesture. For example the user can be presented with a pane that presents the search results together with the prompt Did you mean . . . . In some implementations the user can be prompted to correct the spelling of word such as Did you mean Camera The pane can be presented at any desired location including as a semi translucent overlay. In the example shown the pane replaced the keyboard .

The route of the directions between the start pin and the end pin can be highlight or depicted in some other way to clearly show the route. In some implementations the start pin has a street flag that displays the name of the street on which the start pin is placed. The street flag can have an object that is user selectable. Selection of the can display an interface to allow the user to change the display of the route to show turn by turn directions or to select other options to name a few examples.

When the user performs a search at a first location the map service provides placemarkers e.g. pushpins to indicate search results e.g. the locations of a business which can be presented on the map display . For example if the user searches on the query Starbucks e.g. using the graphical user interface of the map service displays pushpins . . . to indicate the geographic locations of all Starbucks within the geographic area defined by the map display .

When the user moves to a second geographic location the map display can be updated or replaced to maintain the mobile device location or geographic area on the map display e.g. in the center of the map display . These map display updates result in the display of new map tiles which can be received from a network based map service and displayed on the mobile device. While in a live tracking mode the mobile device can automatically perform a query based on the user s first query at the first location and the second automatic query at the user s second location. The query and the second location can be sent to a network based map service e.g. navigation service to determine additional destinations responsive to the search query that are associated with new map tiles. In some implementations this live network based search can be triggered when the map display is updated and or other trigger events.

In some implementations the live query pulls search results from surrounding map areas where the user is likely to be in the near future. Those map areas can be pre populated with pushpins or other markers associated with the search results. For example if the user is traveling along a known route e.g. a highway such information and or other information e.g. velocity can be used to predict where the user will be in the future and generate pre populated map areas for presentation in the map display .

Referring to an example map display is shown. The map display can be the result of an updated map display or other trigger event. For example a map update from map display to map display can be triggered by movement of the mobile device or the geographic region e.g. graphical icon over a route while in a tracking mode. The dashed line in illustrates the route traveled by the mobile device and may not be shown in an actual implementation. When live tracking is enabled as the user moves around search queries are performed and search results are received. The search results that are closest to the user s current location can be presented as pushpins or using other marker types e.g. dots on the map display . In some implementations at least the pin closest to the user s current position is displayed in the map display .

In the example shown the user mobile device is tracked while traveling along Route 82 from Mt. View to Sunnyvale. Responsive to updating the map display to the map display or other trigger event a live search query can be automatically performed using the original user query and the current location of the mobile device. A set of new pushpins . . . associated with new search results e.g. Starbucks locations in Sunnyvale can be displayed on the map display e.g. along Route 82 . At least one pushpin . . . can be associated with a user interface element which when touched or otherwise interacted with displays information e.g. contact information or a contact application and or other options. In some implementations the user interface element can be displayed when the corresponding pushpin is touched. Some examples of information include but are not limited to address phone number email website URL hours of operation payment options ratings reviews etc. In some implementations the phone number and or website URL can be a link that automatically dials the phone number or launches a web browser with the web URL loaded when touched. Some examples of options include but are not limited to an option for getting driving directions an option to add a book mark etc.

Referring to there is shown another example map display where a route is drawn on map display between a current geographic area and a destination . The route can be drawn to provide driving directions to the destination . In some implementations the route can be the shortest route to the destination using public transportation e.g. buses trains subways . In other implementations the route can be the shortest pedestrian route to the destination e.g. walking bicycle . A pedestrian route can be more useful in cities that do not rely on automobiles as the primary mode of transportation.

In some implementations the process can begin by performing a first search using a search query and first location information e.g. position coordinates centroid of a geographic region of a mobile device . One or more first search results e.g. a first set of search results can be obtained from the first search . The first search results can be displayed on a map display of the mobile device . The first search results can be for example a business location. A placemark e.g. a pushpin can be used to indicate the location of the search result on the map display.

Responsive to an update of the map display e.g. due to movement of the mobile device and or other trigger event a second search e.g. a next search can be performed e.g. automatically performed using the search query and second location information for the mobile device . The second search can be performed by a map service application located on a server coupled to a network e.g. Internet . One or more second search results e.g. a consecutive set of search results from the second search can be obtained . The second search results can be displayed on the updated map display of the mobile device .

In some implementations trigger events for a live search can include zooming or panning gestures. For example when a user pans a map outside the current map display a search can be triggered. A set of criteria or rules can be set for determining when such panning will trigger the search. One criteria for a panning trigger event could be a time limit e.g. 2 seconds so that if the user briefly pans outside the current map display then pans back to the current map display a search is not triggered. Other possible trigger event criteria can include the amount or distance of panning or zooming or a particular user activity pattern or gesture.

In some implementations a determination can be made as to whether a search is performed based on current saturation level of pins in the current map display.

The disclosed and other embodiments and the functional operations described in this specification can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry or in computer software firmware or hardware including the structures disclosed in this specification and their structural equivalents or in combinations of one or more of them. The disclosed and other embodiments can be implemented as one or more computer program products i.e. one or more modules of computer program instructions encoded on a computer readable medium for execution by or to control the operation of data processing apparatus. The computer readable medium can be a machine readable storage device a machine readable storage substrate a memory device a composition of matter effecting a machine readable propagated signal or a combination of one or more them. The term data processing apparatus encompasses all apparatus devices and machines for processing data including by way of example a programmable processor a computer or multiple processors or computers. The apparatus can include in addition to hardware code that creates an execution environment for the computer program in question e.g. code that constitutes processor firmware a protocol stack a database management system an operating system or a combination of one or more of them. A propagated signal is an artificially generated signal e.g. a machine generated electrical optical or electromagnetic signal that is generated to encode information for transmission to suitable receiver apparatus.

A computer program also known as a program software software application script or code can be written in any form of programming language including compiled or interpreted languages and it can be deployed in any form including as a stand alone program or as a module component subroutine or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program does not necessarily correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data e.g. one or more scripts stored in a markup language document in a single file dedicated to the program in question or in multiple coordinated files e.g. files that store one or more modules sub programs or portions of code . A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.

The processes and logic flows described in this specification can be performed by one or more programmable processors executing one or more computer programs to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output. The processes and logic flows can also be performed by and apparatus can also be implemented as special purpose logic circuitry e.g. an FPGA field programmable gate array or an ASIC application specific integrated circuit .

Processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include by way of example both general and special purpose microprocessors and any one or more processors of any kind of digital computer. Generally a processor will receive instructions and data from a read only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for performing instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally a computer will also include or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to or both one or more mass storage devices for storing data e.g. magnetic magneto optical disks or optical disks. However a computer need not have such devices. Computer readable media suitable for storing computer program instructions and data include all forms of non volatile memory media and memory devices including by way of example semiconductor memory devices e.g. EPROM EEPROM and flash memory devices magnetic disks e.g. internal hard disks or removable disks magneto optical disks and CD ROM and DVD ROM disks. The processor and the memory can be supplemented by or incorporated in special purpose logic circuitry.

To provide for interaction with a user the disclosed embodiments can be implemented on a computer having a display device e.g. a CRT cathode ray tube or LCD liquid crystal display monitor for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device e.g. a mouse or a trackball by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well for example feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback e.g. visual feedback auditory feedback or tactile feedback and input from the user can be received in any form including acoustic speech or tactile input.

The disclosed embodiments can be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component e.g. as a data server or that includes a middleware component e.g. an application server or that includes a front end component e.g. a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation of what is disclosed here or any combination of one or more such back end middleware or front end components. The components of the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication e.g. a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network LAN and a wide area network WAN e.g. the Internet.

The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client server relationship to each other.
