title: Antibodies which bind variants of the TRP channel family member, LTRPC3
abstract: The present invention provides novel polynucleotides encoding LTRPC3g, LTRPC3h, LTRPC3i, LTRPC3j, LTRPC3k, or LTRPC3l polypeptides, fragments and homologues thereof. Also provided are vectors, host cells, antibodies, and recombinant and synthetic methods for producing said polypeptides. The invention further relates to diagnostic and therapeutic methods for applying these novel LTRPC3g, LTRPC3h, LTRPC3i, LTRPC3j, LTRPC3k, or LTRPC3l polypeptides to the diagnosis, treatment, and/or prevention of various diseases and/or disorders related to these polypeptides. The invention further relates to screening methods for identifying agonists and antagonists of the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention.
