This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 885 068 filed Jan. 16 2007.

Before performing dermatological treatments the patient is locally anesthetized with topical anesthetics. Existing topical anesthetics used on the face take up to an hour to anesthetize effectively. The delay between application and effective anesthesia causes waiting room delays in a medical office. In addition an impatient physician may want to begin a procedure before the patient is fully anesthetized

It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide a topical anesthetic for rapid less than one hour local anesthesia.

With the foregoing and other objects in view there is provided in accordance with the invention a topical anesthetic for rapid local anesthesia. The topical anesthetic includes an anesthetic a volatile solvent and a non volatile solvent.

The anesthetic can be a parenteral local anesthetic such as lidocaine. The anesthetic concentration is four to eight weight percent. Solutions of up to four percent are preferable because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to limit the concentration for over the counter use to four percent of lidocaine.

Parenteral local anesthetics cause loss of feeling before and during surgery dental procedures including dental surgery or labor and delivery. These medicines do not cause loss of consciousness. Examples of parenteral local anesthetics include articaine bupivacaine chloroprocaine etidocaine levobupivacaine lidocaine mepivacaine prilocaine procaine and tetracaine. In the United States these anesthetics are sold under the following trade names CARBOCAINE6 CARBOCAINE WITH NEO COBEFRIN6 CHIROCAINE10 CITANEST FORTE7 CITANEST PLAIN7 DALCAINE5 DILOCAINE5 DURANEST4 DURANEST MPF4 ISOCAINE6 L CAINE5 LIDOJECT 15 LIDOJECT 25 MARCAINE2 MARCAINE SPINAL2 NESACAINE3 NESACAINE MPF3 NOVOCAIN8 OCTOCAINE5 POLOCAINE6 POLOCAINE MPF6 PONTOCAINE9 SENSORCAINE2 SENSORCAINE MPF2 SENSORCAINE MPF SPINAL2 SEPTOCAINE1 XYLOCAINE5 XYLOCAINE MPF5 and XYLOCAINE MPF WITH GLUCOSE5. In Canada the anesthetics are sold under the following trade names ASTRACAINE 4 1 ASTRACAINE 4 FORTE1 CARBOCAINE6 CITANEST FORTE7 CITANEST PLAIN7 ISOCAINE 2 6 ISOCAINE 3 6 MARCAINE2 NESACAINE CE3 NOVOCAIN8 OCTOCAINE 505 OCTOCAINE 1005 POLOCAINE6 PONTOCAINE9 SENSORCAINE2 SENSORCAINE FORTE2 ULTRACAINE D S1 ULTRACAINE D S FORTE1 XYLOCAINE5 XYLOCAINE TEST DOSE5 and XYLOCAINE 5 SPINAL5.

The non volatile solvent system includes oleyl alcohol and propylene glycol. Generally the fatty alcohol can be a Cto Csaturated alcohol a liquid at room temperature Cto Cmono or polyunsaturatured or branched chain alcohol or those same compounds in acid form. The fatty alcohol forms two to six percent of the formulation by weight and in particular four percent by weight of the formulation.

The other non volatile solvent propylene glycol or a butane diol with adjacent hydroxyl groups forms between two and six percent by weight of the formulation.

The formulation includes a volatile short chain alcohol such as isopropyl alcohol IPA or ethanol. Short chain alcohols include the isomers of butanol propanol ethanol and methanol. The short chain alcohol forms between sixty and eighty five percent by weight of the formulation. A thickener can be added that is soluble in the total solvent system. A suitable thickener is hydroxypropylcellulose HPC . The thickener can form between two and five tenths and three and five tenths percent by weight of the formulation. The HPC is sold under the trade name KLUCEL.

The formulation also can include a volatile silicone. The preferred volatile silicone is polydimethylsiloxane. The volatile silicone forms up to twenty five percent by weight of the formulation. A suitable polydimethylsiloxane is sold under the trademark DOW CORNING 200. Volatile silicone is odorless. In addition volatile silicone has a low heat of evaporation so it does not create a cold sensation when evaporating after being deposited on the skin.

A thickener can be added to help hold the topical anesthetic on the site of the skin to be anesthetized. Without the thickener the topical anesthetic would likely run off the skin. Other devices can be used to hold the topical anesthetic on the skin such as a gauze pad.

The invention also encompasses a method applying the topical anesthetic to a face of a patient without occlusion. The above described topical anesthetic is applied to an injection site i.e. a surface or area on the skin of a patient. After approximately fifteen minutes a dermatological procedure such as a cosmetic injection can be performed. The topical anesthetic can also be used as an anesthetic before circumcision. The topical anesthetic not only can be used to anesthetize cosmetic injection sites on or near the face but any other suitable injection site. The topical anesthetic also can be used to numb any topical pain such as a burn scrape or cut.

Other features which are considered as characteristic for the invention are set forth in the appended claims.

As stated an object of the invention is to provide a topical lidocaine formulation that provides faster local anesthesia than prior art formulations that include four percent 4 by weight of lidocaine. A further object is to provide a topical lidocaine formulation producing local anesthesia at least twenty percent 20 faster than current products and lasts the duration of a subsequent procedure.

The resulting topical lidocaine gel has the following qualities. The topical anesthetic gel is a clear to translucent viscous gel that remains on the area of application while not leaving a film that can be easily wiped off prior to injection.

The topical anesthetic gel provides maximum local anesthesia within fifteen to twenty minutes without occlusion. The local anesthesia allowing for mild to deep dermal implantation of dermal fillers such as hyaluronic acid gels such as those sold under the trademark RESTYLANE by HA North American Sales AB and Botulinum Toxin Type A such as those sold under the trademark BOTOX Purified Neurotoxin Complex by Allergan Inc. . It is also believed that the topical anesthetic gel provides sufficient local anesthesia for various dermatological office procedures such as skin biopsies and removal of pre cancerous lesions moles etc.

Topical anesthetic formulations that contain four percent by weight of lidocaine have been found to be effective as an external analgesic for topical anesthesia by the Food and Drug Administration Federal Register Volume 48 Number 27 . The topical anesthetic gel described previously is specially formulated to penetrate intact skin without occlusion for the rapid relief of pain caused by minor skin irritations minor burns minor cuts and insect bites as well as topical anesthesia for dermatological procedures.

In accordance with the objects of the invention a topical anesthetic gel is provided. The topical anesthetic gel includes lidocaine in concentrations from 1 to 10 by weight in a drug delivery base composed of propylene glycol unsaturated fatty alcohols thickeners isopropyl alcohol and other volatile components that have been proven safe for topical administration.

A typical package is a tube that holds two grams 2.0 g . The tube is single use for application to an individual patient.

Although the invention is illustrated and described herein as embodied in a topical anesthetic for rapid local anesthesia and a method of applying a topical anesthetic it is nevertheless not intended to be limited to the details shown because various modifications and structural changes may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention and within the scope and range of equivalents of the claims.

The construction and method of operation of the invention however together with additional objects and advantages thereof will be best understood from the following description of specific embodiments.

The ingredients in the preferred embodiment have been found to make an effective product when in the following approximate ranges 

Fatty alcohols are aliphatic alcohols derived from natural fats and oils. They are the counterparts of fatty acids. They usually but not always have an even number of carbon atoms. They find use in the cosmetics and food industry. Fatty alcohols are a common component of waxes mostly as esters with fatty acids but also as alcohols themselves. Those with common names include 

Propylene glycol known also by the systematic name propane 1 2 diol is an organic compound a diol usually a tasteless odorless and colorless clear oily liquid that is hygroscopic and miscible with water acetone and chloroform. It is manufactured by the hydration of propylene oxide.

For the KLUCEL hydroxypropylcellulose there are a number of pharmaceutical grades that vary in molecular weight.

Two lidocaine formulations are being evaluated. Formulation 1 contains 3 KLUCEL. Formulation 2 contains 2 KLUCEL.

Both formulations are clear to translucent liquids. Formulation 1 is slightly thicker than Formulation 2 but both are sufficiently viscous so as not to drip when applied.

Patient 1 Formulation 1 experienced numbness almost immediately and was able to be injected after 15 minutes exposure. No pain due to the needle stick was noted.

Patient 2 Formulation 2 experienced numbness almost immediately and was able to be injected after 15 minutes exposure. Patient indicated that the pain at injection was similar to previous procedures that utilized EMLA. However previous procedures allowed the EMLA to remain on the skin for over 60 minutes prior to injection.

Patient 3 Formulation 1 two applications 15 minutes apart were made. Patient experienced pain on injections similar to previous injections. Again previous procedures utilized EMLA and greater than 60 minutes exposure.

Patient 4 Formulations 1 and 2 Products were applied to the left and right side of the site to evaluate the products side by side. Formulation 1 was judged superior by the patient faster numbness. Injections were made 15 to 20 minutes after application.

Two additional patients were evaluated. Samples were applied as per Patient 4 above. In both cases Formulation 1 was judged superior. In addition one patient that required removal of a growth was treated with Formulation 1 and after 15 minutes had no pain at the site of biopsy.
