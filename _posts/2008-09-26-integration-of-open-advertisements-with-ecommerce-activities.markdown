The disclosed embodiments relate to the integration of open advertisements from online auctions with other e commerce activities and more particularly to the integration of open advertisements related to auction listings with targeted websites and with search results pages.

Electronic commerce or e commerce consists of the buying and selling of products or services over electronic systems such as the Internet and other computer networks. The amount of trade conducted electronically has grown extraordinarily since the spread of the Internet. A wide variety of commerce is conducted in this way spurring and drawing on innovations in electronic funds transfer supply chain management Internet marketing online transaction processing electronic data interchange EDI inventory management systems and automated data collection systems. Modem electronic commerce or e commerce typically uses the World Wide Web Web at least at some point in the transaction s lifecycle although it can encompass a wider range of technologies such as e mail as well.

A large percentage of e commerce is conducted entirely electronically for virtual items such as access to premium content on a website but most e commerce involves the transportation of physical items in some way. Online retailers are sometimes known as e tailers and online retail is sometimes known as e tail. Almost all big retailers have electronic commerce presence on the Web.

Online auctions are increasing in popularity which include Yahoo eBay Ubid Overstock etc. The auction sites for Yahoo currently include those in Hong Kong Singapore and Taiwan. Another increasingly popular auction site is that for Asian Pacific Auction Centre APAC which includes global marketing that brings together buyers and sellers. That is the APAC site provides to its sellers opportunities to also be advertisers of their goods in a system that identifies goods to be sold and unites buyers and sellers in purchasing arrangements.

Internet advertising is also a multi billion dollar industry and is growing at double digits rates in recent years. It is also the major revenue source for Internet companies such as Yahoo of Sunnyvale Calif. or Google of Mountain View Calif. which provide advertising networks that connect advertisers publishers and Internet users. A major portion of revenue has historically comes from sponsored search advertisements and other advertising related to conducting search through search engines for instance. Another major source of revenue includes serving display advertisements to Web pages that include content matching material related to the advertisement. These Web pages may be located with an affiliate network such as created or hosted by Yahoo or Google or may be third party websites that exist outside of a network of such service providers. No online search or advertising company however has integrated open advertisements created to promote online auction listings through affiliate or third party websites or through search results pages from its search marketing systems.

By way of introduction the embodiments described below are drawn to the integration of open advertisements from online auctions with other e commerce activities and more particularly to the integration of open advertisements related to auction listings with targeted websites and with search results pages.

In a first aspect a computer implemented method is disclosed for integration of open advertisements with targeted websites including enabling a seller over a network with an online auction server to place a product on auction through an auction website wherein the auction server creates an auction listing for the product together with a first software code affiliated with the auction listing marking the first software code to function with a targeted website in response to the seller requesting an open advertisement of the auction listing receiving a call of the software code from a targeted website server that hosts the targeted website generating a second software code with the first software code wherein the second software code includes an auction product identification to provide access to the auction server and sending the second software code to the targeted website server wherein the second software code is configured to create the open advertisement that displays specific information related to the auction listing to be served to an advertisement position of the targeted website.

In a second aspect a computer implemented method is disclosed for integration of open advertisements with search marketing including enabling a seller over a network with an online auction server to place a product on auction through an auction website wherein the auction server creates an auction listing for the product enabling the seller through the auction server to request an open advertisement to promote the auction listing through a search marketing ad server which serves advertisements to search results pages creating a first software code by the auction server to be affiliated with the auction listing receiving a call of the first software code from the search marketing ad server generating a second software with the first software code wherein the second software code includes an auction product identification to provide access to the auction server and sending the second software code to the search marketing ad server wherein the second software code is configured to create the open advertisement that displays specific information to be served to an advertisement position of a search results page in response to a search query.

In a third aspect a computer implemented method is disclosed for integration of open advertisements with search marketing including authenticating access of an auction seller to a search marketing ad server by verifying a user identification USERID and password created during a process of creating an auction listing of a product through an online auction server receiving by the search marketing ad server from the seller information requested to create an open advertisement to promote the auction listing on search results pages wherein the information comprises a bid uniform resource locator URL that links to the auction listing a keyword relevant to the product being auctioned and a method of being charged and serving by the search marketing ad server the open advertisement to a position of a search results page returned in response to a search by a potential bidder for the keyword.

In a fourth aspect a system is disclosed for integration of open advertisements with targeted websites including an online auction server to enable a seller over a network to place a product on auction through an auction website wherein the auction server creates an auction listing for the product the auction server including. The system includes a memory a processor coupled with the memory a communication interface coupled with the processor and the memory and a software code generator coupled with the processor and configured to create a remotely executable first software code in response to the creation of an auction listing for the product. The communication interface receives a call of the first software code from a targeted website server that hosts a targeted website. The processor is configured to generate a second software code with the first software code wherein the second software code includes an auction product identification ID to provide access to the auction server. The communication interface sends the second software code to the targeted website server wherein the second software code is configured to create the open advertisement that displays specific information related to the auction listing to be served to an advertisement position of the targeted website.

In a fifth aspect a system is disclosed for integration of open advertisements with search marketing including an online auction server to enable a seller over a network to place a product on auction through an auction website. The auction server creates an auction listing for the product the auction server including a memory a processor coupled with the memory a communication interface coupled with the processor and the memory and a software code generator coupled with the processor and configured to create a first software code in response to the creation of an auction listing for the product. The processor and the communication interface are configured to enable the seller to request an open advertisement to promote the auction listing through a search marketing ad server which serves advertisements to search results pages wherein the software code generator creates the first software code to be affiliated with the auction listing. The communication interface receives a call of the first software code from the search marketing ad server and the processor is configured to generate a second software code with the first software code wherein the second software code includes an auction product identification ID to provide access to the auction server.

The communication interface receives from the seller information requested to create an open advertisement to promote the auction listing on search results pages wherein the information comprises a bid uniform resource locator URL that links to the auction listing a keyword relevant to the product being auctioned and a method of being charged. The advertisement deliverer serves the open advertisement to a position of a search results page returned in response to a search by a potential bidder for the keyword.

Other systems methods features and advantages will be or will become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems methods features and advantages be included within this description be within the scope of the invention and be protected by the following claims.

By way of introduction the disclosed embodiments relate to the integration of open advertisements from online auctions with other e commerce activities and more particularly to the integration of open advertisements related to auction listings with targeted websites and with search results pages. The integration of open advertisements with targeted websites and search results pages of online search pages allows auction sellers to better promote their products to thereby increase bidder interest driving up final sales amounts on auctioned goods. The term open advertisement means an advertisement of an auctioned product or service for which open public access to bidding is available for all potential bidders. Also it is open for any seller to advertise their product on search result pages and other third party web pages through the open advertisements. In the present context potential bidders may include any searchers of the Internet or the World Wide Web Web to whom may be served advertisements on Web pages delivered to their browsers while searching or browsing.

The system may further include an auction server having a memory a processor a communication interface a database a software code generator and an auctioneer administrator . The auction server is configured to produce an auction website having a bidding sub page for potential bidders to access to bid on products of sellers over the network .

The system may further include a search marketing ads server having a memory a processor a communication interface a database a search results formatter and an advertisement ad deliverer . The search marketing ads server may interface or otherwise be integrated with a search engine not shown and be configured to serve any number of advertisements to search results pages . The advertisements may include sponsored advertisements paid for by advertisers and particular to this application an open advertisement including an auction bid link or other selectable hyperlink indicia requested by sellers.

The system may further include a targeted website server having a memory a processor a communication interface a database a website formatter and an advertisement ad deliverer . The targeted website server is configured to produce targeted websites and to serve any number of advertisements to the targeted websites . The advertisements may include sponsored advertisements and particular to this application an open advertisement including an auction bid link . The auction bid link when selected by potential bidders through browsers of the potential bidder machines redirect the potential bidders through the network to the bidding sub page of the auction website where the potential bidders may bid on an auctioned product being advertised in the open advertisement .

The auction server the search marketing ads server and the targeted website server may be coupled with each other with a local connection or remotely over the network . Herein the phrase coupled with is defined to mean directly connected to or indirectly connected through one or more intermediate components.

A seller may place a product on auction to sell it by accessing the auction server over the network . Once the seller from the seller browser signs up for an auction of a product the auction server creates an auction listing to list that product on the auction website . While the auction website may provide a limited amount of advertising for the auction fee it charges the potential bidder exposure to potential bidders is limited because not everyone that may be interested in the auction would know that the product is being sold or that they could bid on the product through the auction website .

A seller therefore through the embodiments disclosed herein may achieve quick seamless advertising that would reach a greater audience of potential bidders by accessing services of the search marketing ads server and or the targeted website server provided to serve the open advertisement to a number of possible targeted websites or search results pages . To facilitate this process the auction server through its software code generator creates an application programming interface API code or other remotely executable software code at the time the seller creates the auction listing and chooses to advertise outside of the auction website . At a time of registration of the seller the auction server will also provide to a seller a user identification USERID and or password that the communication interface may use to authenticate access to the auction server .

The API code which will be discussed in more detail below may be created to be specific to one or more products which may or may not be associated with one or more keywords. Other software code or scripting that may be executed through a remote procedure call RPC may be used accordingly the API code referred to herein is exemplary only and should not be construed to limit the types of software code used which may include any type of software code configured to deliver scripting or self executable code that may be used to generate the open advertisements . Accordingly the API code as used herein is understood to include any remotely executable software code. An RPC is sometimes referred to as a remote server call. The API or other code additionally may be activated when called by a remote source when that source seeks to serve an open advertisement affiliated with one or more auctioned products. The server side code on the auction server that gets invoked from a client such as the search marketing ads server or the targeted website server may also be referred to as a service. The act of making a RPC is sometimes referred to as invoking a service.

The targeted website server may through the website formatter and other hardware and software as discussed above format a targeted website to be hosted on the Internet or Web. The advertisement deliverer which may be coupled with the processor and the website formatter may play its role by delivering or serving advertisements to various advertisement locations on the targeted website . To generate an open advertisement to be served with other advertisements or served alone the advertisement deliverer calls the auction API or other software code that resides on the auction server e.g. stored in the database thereof that was created for the auctioned product. This process will be discussed in more detail below. The open advertisement contains information to promote the auctioned product and to link to an auction listing available through the bidding sub page of the auction website . The communication interface of the targeted website server may facilitate local and or networked communication of the targeted website server with the seller machines the potential bidder machines and the auction server .

As will be discussed in more detail the targeted website server and corresponding targeted websites may include websites of an affiliate service provider of the auction server e.g. Yahoo or eBay or may be a third party website hosted outside of the service provider network of the auction server .

The search marketing ads server may through its search results formatter and other hardware and software as discussed above format a search results page including a plurality of relevant results which generally include uniform resource locator URL links to each document or webpage within the search results list . The seller may access a search marketing website not shown of the search marketing ads server and sign up to be a search marketing advertiser if not already done through an advertising broker such as Yahoo The search marketing ad server may register the seller if needed and create a search user identification USERID and or password for future authenticated access of the seller to the search marketing ads server . The search marketing ad server will also prompt the seller to supply information required to produce a sponsored ad listing only this time one integrated with the open advertisement of the auctioned product. This information may include but is not limited to a method for charging the seller for potential bidder traffic how much the seller wants to budget for costs per day a keyword related to the product to be advertised and product identifications as available. This information and its use will be discussed in more detail below.

The advertisement deliverer of the search marketing ads server may then play its role by delivering or serving advertisements to various advertisement locations on one or more search results pages . These advertisement locations are generally referred to as sponsored advertisement slots which historically have been located at the cardinal north south and east directions on a search results page . To generate an open advertisement to be served with other sponsored advertisements the advertisement deliverer which may be coupled with the processor and search results formatter calls the auction API that resides on the auction server that was created for the auctioned product. The open advertisement contains information to promote the auctioned product and to link to an auction listing available through the bidding sub page of the auction website . The communication interface may facilitate local and or networked communication of the search marketing ads server with the seller machines the potential bidder machines and the auction server .

With further reference to note that each listing of the open advertisement includes a Bid Now text each of which includes a separate auction bid hyperlink to the bidding sub page of the auction website for each respective auction listing. The auction bid link may be variably referred to herein as simply a bid uniform resource locator URL . Further included in the open advertisement for each auction listing is included a thumbnail of the product image a descriptive title a bidding price a time left to the end of bidding and optionally a product URL not shown . The product URL may be incorporated into the existing features of the open advertisement by creating a hyperlink of one or more of the descriptive titles or thumbnails .

At block potential inputs into the targeted website server may include but are not limited to a USERID a password a keyword and a product ID. These are used to authenticate a seller with the USERID and or password identify a keyword to be associated with a called API or simply identify the product affiliated with the auction listing which is being promoted by the seller. The keyword may be associated with multiple auction listed products whereas the product ID is affiliated with a single auction listed product. At block the auction server and or the targeted website server verifies login information to authenticate access by the seller to the auction server for purposes of affiliating the API with the products of the seller. Once the seller has logged in at block the auction server marks the auction API to function with the targeted website . In other words the auction API or other remotely executable software code already exists and will not function its default until a software flag is set at block thus marking the auction API to function for a specific product and seller.

At block the targeted website server calls the auction API stored in the auction server . The call may be sent with USERID and keywords as inputs. The auction server then creates an output at block which is sent to the targeted website server . The output includes a software code such as may be formed by a scripted self executable code such as JavaScript or by any other data interchange format such as XML based syndication formats both referred to generally hereinafter as scripted code . The scripted code may include auction product identifications IDs which may be encrypted. At about the same time as the output is generated the auction server may create a frontend API A for execution in a frontend A of the auction server . The frontend and auction API s A may be coupled together. Use of the frontend API accordingly is optional to improve the security of the system as described below.

At block the scripted code is executed to call the auction server with the encrypted product ID previously entered by the seller. When that call is made the frontend API A may decrypt the encrypted product ID to authenticate access by the targeted website server thus preventing abuse or fraud on the frontend A of the auction server by a hacker or the like. The auction API via the frontend API A then returns an open advertisement module in hypertext markup language HTML which at block is served to the targeted website . The open advertisement module may also be implemented in some other compatible software language. If a submitted keyword is related to more than one auctioned product then the auction API that is generated is configured to generate scripted code that may create the HTML module such as displayed in wherein the open advertisement includes each product related to that keyword.

Once the seller is authenticated for access the login is complete and the flow chart passes to block . At block the auction server marks the internal API or other remotely executable software code to function with the affiliate website . At block the affiliate website server calls the internal API stored in the auction server . The auction server then creates an output at block which is sent to the affiliate website server . The output includes a software code such as may be formed by a scripted self executable code such as JavaScript or by any other data interchange format such as XML based syndication formats both referred to generally hereinafter as scripted code . The scripted code may include auction product identifications IDs which may be encrypted. At about the same time as the output is generated the auction server may create a frontend API A for execution in a frontend A of the auction server . The frontend and auction API s A may be coupled together.

At block the scripted code is executed to call the auction server with the encrypted product ID previously entered by the seller. When that call is made the frontend API A may decrypt the encrypted product ID to authenticate access by the affiliate website server thus preventing abuse or fraud on the frontend A of the auction server by a hacker or the like. The auction API via the frontend API A then returns an open advertisement module in hypertext markup language HTML which at block is served to the affiliate website . The open advertisement module may also be implemented in some other compatible software language.

Once the seller is authenticated for access to the auction server the login is complete and the flow chart passes to block . Note however while not shown the auction server may register a first time seller seeking to post his or her first open advertisement through the auction server . At block the auction server determines whether the seller desires to enable the external auction API or other remotely executable software code. If so then the auction server at block charges the seller for the subscription to the external API and at block marks the external auction API to function with the third party website .

At block the third party website server calls the external API or other remotely executable software code stored in the auction server . The auction server then creates an output at block which is sent to the third party website server . The output includes a software script or scripted code such as discussed previously which may include auction product identifications IDs . The auction product IDs may be encrypted. At about the same time as the output is generated the auction server creates a frontend API A for execution in a frontend A of the auction server . The frontend and auction API s A may be coupled together.

At block the scripted code is executed to call the auction server with the encrypted product ID previously entered by the seller. When that call is made the frontend API A decrypts the encrypted product ID to authenticate access by the third party website server thus preventing abuse or fraud on the frontend A of the auction server by a hacker or the like. The auction API via the frontend API A then returns an open advertisement module in hypertext markup language HTML which at block is served to a position on the third party website . The open advertisement module may also be implemented in some other compatible software language. If a submitted keyword is related to more than one auctioned product than the auction API that is generated is configured to generate scripted code that may create the HTML module such as displayed in wherein the open advertisement includes each product related to that keyword.

As with the open advertisement includes advertisement listings for three different iPhone products. Note that each listing of the open advertisement includes a Bid Now text each of which includes a separate auction bid hyperlink to the bidding sub page of the auction website for each respective auction listing. The auction bid link may be variably referred to herein as simply a bid uniform resource locator URL . Further included in the open advertisement for each auction listing is included a thumbnail of the product image a descriptive title a bidding price a time left to end of bid and optionally a product URL not shown . The product URL may be incorporated into the existing features of the open advertisement by creating a hyperlink of one or more of the descriptive titles or thumbnails .

To generate an open advertisement to be served with other sponsored advertisements the advertisement deliverer which may be coupled with the processor and search results formatter calls the auction API that resides on the auction server e.g. in the database thereof that was created for the auctioned product. The communication interface may facilitate local and or networked communication of the search marketing ads server with the seller machines the potential bidder machines and the auction server .

At block the search marketing ads server determines whether or not the seller has logged into the search marketing ads server . If the seller has not yet registered for search marketing through the search marketing ads server the method includes registration of the new seller at block . At block the search marketing ads server receives information from the seller through a submission form not shown including the cost per click cost per view or cost per bid depending on how the seller chooses to be charged for potential bidders accessing the open advertisement on the search results pages . In other words the seller may choose to be charged for the open advertisement and bid link on a basis of pay per click PPC pay per thousands of views or impressions CPM or on pay per bid PPB basis. The information received from the seller may also include the amount of budget that may be spent each day one or more keywords associated with each open advertisement auction listing and a product identification ID associated with each auctioned product if not already sent directly by the auction server .

At block the search marketing ads server determines which auction advertisement listings are to be shown by sorting out product IDs with search keywords. As discussed earlier if a keyword is associated with more than one product of the seller the open advertisement generated by way of the auction API will include auction listings information for each auctioned listing. If only one or more specific products IDs are to be associated with the open advertisement then the auction API may ignore the keywords and generate a scripted code to create an open advertisement associated with only designated products IDs.

At block the search marketing ads server calls the auction API or other remotely executable software code stored on the auction server . At block the search marketing ads server receives the output of the auction server including a scripted code generated by the auction API . As discussed above the scripted code may include JavaScript or any other data interchange format such as XML based syndication formats. The scripted code may include auction product identifications IDs which may encrypted. At about the same time as the output is generated the auction server may create a frontend API A for execution in a frontend A of the auction server . The frontend and auction API s A may be coupled together.

At block the scripted code is executed to call the auction server with the encrypted product ID previously entered by the seller. When that call is made the frontend API A may decrypt the encrypted product ID to authenticate access by the search marketing ad server thus preventing abuse or fraud on the frontend A of the auction server by a hacker or the like. The auction API via the frontend API A then returns an open advertisement module in hypertext markup language HTML or in some other compatible software language. At block the HTML module is served to the sponsored advertisement slots as the open advertisement .

The displayed open advertisement includes three different iPhone products and each respective set of auction listed information including the URL bid link to the bidding sub page of the auction website for each product. When a potential bidder selects the URL bid link it redirects the potential bidder browser to the biding sub page of the auction website . The open advertisement of is but one example where different products may all be affiliated with the same keyword and therefore be served together as a single advertisement.
