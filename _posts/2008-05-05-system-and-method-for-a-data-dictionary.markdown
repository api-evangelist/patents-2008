As such in one implementation the service application of the user device may include one or more applications and or operations of the processing component of the server device .

Referring to a part number and or engineering description is obtained block . In one implementation the user may input a part number into the user device and the service application of the user device may transfer the inputted part number to processing application of the server device via the network . The processing application may obtain the engineering description related to the part number from the database of the server device . In another implementation the user may input a part number into the user device and the service application of the user device obtains the engineering description related to the part number from the database of the user device . The service application transfers the part number and or engineering description to processing application of the server device for processing.

Next the engineering description of the part number is translated into proper English terms words and or phrases block . In one implementation the processing application of the server device translates the engineering description related to the part number from the database . The part number and or engineering description may be stored as part of data object for ease of reference.

One or more technical synonyms of the proper English terms including abbreviations acronyms and jargon are identified block and described below. In one implementation the processing application of the server device may identify the technical synonyms based on information stored in the database . For example the database may comprise a relational database that includes nomenclature abbreviations and acronyms related to machine components e.g. aircraft components . These and other aspects related to the data relation process of are described in greater detail herein.

Referring to a user request is received block . In one implementation the processing application of the server device receives a request for data and information from the user via the user device over the network .

Next the engineering description is parsed into text strings block . In one implementation the processing application of the server device retrieves an engineering description of a particular part from the database and parses the engineering description into text strings. The part number is passed with the user request and the part number is used to retrieve the engineering description form the database .

Next equivalent English terms are determined block . In one implementation the processing application of the server device determines equivalent English terms related to the parsed text strings of the engineering description.

Next one or more graphical representations of query constraints and logic are provided or generated block . In one implementation the processing application of the server device is adapted to generate graphical representations of query constraints and logic. These and other aspects related to the data relation process of are described in greater detail herein.

In various embodiments to extract applicable data from maintenance log book and manual text for the purpose of performing reliability and maintainability analysis the user e.g. operator technician engineer or analyst utilizes the processing application and the processes of respectively to determine query keywords for searching the database to translate engineering terms and or descriptions into search criteria by identifying English word equivalents to engineering terms descriptions acronyms and or abbreviations. For example an engineering description may read SW FUEL BOOST PUMP LOW PRESS and the processing application translates this into SWITCH BOOST PUMP PRESSURE. Then the processing application identifies one or more possible synonyms for these words and defines the query logic BOOST PUMP or PMP PRESSURE or PRES or PRESS SWITCH or SW . In one aspect the process is an enhancement to common query tools in that it automatically defines search criteria and does not use the industry standard wild card approach. These enhancements enable a more user friendly interface faster processing speeds and more accurate search results.

In one implementation the processing application is hosted on an Oracle 10g server device and the database includes one or more reference tables that comprise associations or relations between engineering terms abbreviations and words. The user e.g. a maintenance technician may use proper English as well as industry jargon to search the database . In one implementation a Java interface may be used to run the processing application as a web based application to parse out terms and link one or more possible synonyms in a graphic logic tree. By automatically defining search criteria and logic the processing application which is used as a data dictionary enable the user e.g. an engineer or analyst to extract a large amount of relevant text information for a given machinery component e.g. an airplane or part thereof with less core knowledge.

In one embodiment the processing application translates engineering component descriptions and definitions e.g. design engineering acronyms and abbreviations into proper English words and the processing application translates English words into operational jargon of machine maintenance technicians.

For example Part Number ASN 28 42 522 201 SW FUEL BOOST PUMP LOW PRES INDG and translates to SWITCH FUEL BOOST PUMP LOW PRESSURE INDICATING .

These translations are based on query requests provided to the processing application of the server device by the user interfacing with the user device . In one implementation a graphical user interface GUI is used by the service application of the user device to enhance query results of the processing application of the server device . For example the user may deselect unnecessary criteria to enhance query results in a basic query . Referring to by deselecting words in the basic query such as INDICATING the query is freed from the constraints of the whole description. However this particular embodiment may not be flexible enough to accommodate the use of operational jargon.

For example Operational Jargon MTC MSG 28 13111 is replaced with LTFWD BOOST FUEL PUMP PRESS SWITCH OPS AND LEAK CK GOOD MCO PLACRD REMOVED .

Therefore the processing application of the server device may operate as a thesaurus or data dictionary to associate one or more possible synonyms that a technician may use for each technical term. As such in one implementation the GUI is used by the service application of the user device to enhance query results of the processing application of the server device . For example referring to by including one or more synonyms of the term PRESSURE an advanced query is adapted to return relevant data and information that may not be identified by a strict keyword search.

In one implementation the processing application is adapted to provide one or more synonyms and logic needed to extract relevant data and information with the least amount of user input. The user may elect to omit certain terms from the query criteria through the GUI interface or create an infinite number of word and logic combinations in the advanced query as shown in .

In one implementation the processing application uses reference tables comprising abbreviations acronyms terms and criteria that is referenced to automatically build a text query from a part number and or an engineering definition. For example the processing application uses an acronym table a thesaurus table and a stop list or table.

In one embodiment the acronym table comprises a list of part numbers that include one or more acronyms. In some cases an acronym may be used in lieu of a long part name.

It is important to distinguish that many part number descriptions do not include an acronym but in the cases where an acronym exists this table is referenced to create the OR statement.

All the terms in the ABBREVIATION column are unique unless a CRITERIA exists however a term may occur multiple times in the LONG NAME column. When the same LONG NAME occurs multiple times it forms a one to many relationship with the ABBREVIATION column.

For example the word CONTROL may be abbreviated as CNTL CNTRL CONT CONTL CONTOL CONTRL COTRL CTL or CTRL.

If an ABBREVIATION has multiple meanings the CRITERIA column is used specify which meaning to use this avoids a many to many relationship . The application references the beginning digits of the part number to determine which term to use.

For example if the part number starts with 49 then ASC APU STRART CONTROLLER else ASC AURAL SYNTHESIZER CARD.

The STOPLIST is used as a text analyzer and includes a list of terms that may occur in machine maintenance text but do not include specific component information required in the analysis. These terms may be suppressed from text analysis.
