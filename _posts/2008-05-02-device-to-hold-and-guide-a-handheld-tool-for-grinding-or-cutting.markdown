The invention claimed herein was made in the performance of work under a NASA contract and is subject to the provisions of Public Law 96 517 35 USC 202 in which the Contractor has elected to retain title.

Embodiments of the present invention relate to hobby tools and more particularly to a device to secure and guide a hand held tool for cutting or grinding.

A typical hobbyist often does not have available tools for precise cutting grinding or shaping of metal parts due to the relatively large expense of machine shop tools. Some hobbyists make use of angle grinders and chop saws to make cuts and to grind various materials. An angle grinder may be difficult to hold steady and may be difficult to move in a precise way. Furthermore the work piece may be difficult to view because the view angle for providing the clearest view may result in sparks being thrown at the user s face. Traditionally a chop saw has only one type of motion namely a pivotal type motion. Because of this limitation in when cutting through thick material the work piece may eventually conform to the shape of the chop saw blade thereby producing a relatively large contact area between the blade and work piece. This large contact area may results in a substantial reduction in cutting efficiency before the cut has been completed and may contribute to excessive local heating.

In the description that follows the scope of the term some embodiments is not to be so limited as to mean more than one embodiment but rather the scope may include one embodiment more than one embodiment or perhaps all embodiments.

So that the view of may be compared to the views of the other illustrations a right handed coordinate system is illustrated in where the x axis and y axis lie in the plane of illustration and the z axis is perpendicular to the plane of illustration pointing out of the page and towards the reader. As will be described below the device illustrated in allows tool to be guided along the horizontal x axis direction and allows for height adjustment of tool in the vertical y axis direction.

Tool is held securely in place by tool holder . For some embodiments tool holder may comprise two or more pieces clamped tightly around tool by tightening screws. Pivot member allows tool holder and therefore tool to pivot about a pivot axis as indicated by arrows . The pivot axis is parallel to the z axis. For some embodiments pivot member is stationary with respect to tool holder . For example pivot member may be a short cylinder physically attached to tool holder . For such an embodiment pivot member rotates freely within a hole drilled in vertical adjustment arm . For some embodiments pivot member may be stationary with respect to vertical adjustment arm . For example pivot member may be a cylindrical member physically attached to vertical adjustment arm and engaged with a hole formed in tool holder .

Vertical adjustment arm includes a protrusion or jog . Screw is threaded through a member of tool holder labeled with an end resting on protrusion . Member may be a lip formed on holder or it may be a separate component attached to tool holder . Member has a threaded hole to receive screw . The center of gravity of the combination of tool holder and tool is such that if screw were removed tool would start to pivot clockwise about the pivot axis. The combination of screw and protrusion acts as a stop so that the vertical position of tool may be set. For example if screw were a right handed threaded screw then turning screw clockwise increases the length of screw between member and protrusion thereby lifting up tool so that wheel is moved to a higher vertical position. Similarly turning screw counterclockwise decreases the length of screw between member protrusion thereby letting tool fall such that wheel is brought closer to platform . This may be viewed as a fine vertical adjustment of tool . Vertical adjustment arm comes into play to provide coarse vertical adjustment of tool . This will be discussed later.

Vertical adjustment arm is supported by support member . As shown in vertical adjustment arm has a slot so that it may be tightened against support member by tightening wing nut . Wing nut is threaded about bolt . A hole not shown in support member receives bolt . For the particular embodiment of there is another support member hidden behind support member where this hidden support member receives an end of bolt . This hidden support member will be described later. Tightening wing nut about bolt causes washer to press vertical adjustment arm tightly against support member . Support member is attached to support member arms and . Support member arms and have holes through which rail is inserted so that tool holder and consequently tool may be moved along the horizontal direction by sliding support member arms and along rail . This horizontal movement is indicated by arrow . Rail is supported by rail support members and which in turn are attached to platform .

Relative to the plan view illustrated in another rail is behind rail . This is illustrated in showing a perspective view of the device of . However for ease of illustration most components in are not shown in . The top edge of platform is shaded to distinguish it from the other components in . As seen in in addition to rail rail is supported by rail support members and . Support member arms and in also comprise holes to receive rail . Although it may not be readily apparent from the perspective illustrated in for the embodiment in and rails and are positioned so that they are approximately above the center of platform . For the embodiment illustrated in support bar helps stabilize rail support members and . However other embodiments may employ different structures for stabilizing rail support members and . For ease of illustration support bar was not shown in . 

Just as rail is hidden behind rail in the plan view of another vertical adjustment arm is hidden behind vertical adjustment arm . This hidden vertical adjustment arm also includes a slot and as discussed earlier there is another support member hidden behind support member . These complements are illustrated in where provides a perspective view of rails and support member arms and support member wing nut and washer and vertical adjustment arm . Also shown in are some of the components hidden in the plan view of such as vertical adjustment arm support member and washer . Furthermore illustrates bolt received by a hole not shown in support member . For ease of illustration only a portion of these components are shown in .

Tightening wing nut causes washer to hold vertical adjustment arm against support member as described earlier and also causes washer to hold vertical adjustment arm against support member . Loosening wing nut allows for the vertical adjustment of vertical adjustment arms and as indicated by arrow in . In practice when tool is adjusted close to its desired height wing nut may be tightened again to secure vertical adjustment arms and against support members and respectively.

Movement of vertical adjustment arms and may be viewed as a course vertical adjustment to the position of tool . Turning screw clockwise or counterclockwise provides a fine vertical adjustment to the position of tool as discussed previously.

Referring to spark backstop is attached to the left end of the device to catch sparks that may be emitted when using tool to cut metal. So as not to clutter the illustration spark backstop is not shown in . Some embodiments may not employ spark backstop or for some embodiments spark backstop may be attached to the device so that it may be easily removed if desired.

Formed on platform is a table on which the object to be cut or grinded may be supported. This table is not shown in and so as not to obscure those illustrations but is illustrated in the embodiment of . is a plan view of some of the components of the device when looking down from the position above platform . In the particular embodiment of slats are attached to the top edges of platform and to table support member where table support member runs in the x axis direction and is attached to the ends of platform . The illustration in does not show the other components of the device such as rail support members and rails and as well as tool and the structure that supports and guides tool . However when an object is placed on slats the thickness of these slats is such that the object is a above table support member and because the ends of these slats do not touch each other so as to form a cutting channel there is room for wheel to cut or grind the object without damaging the table structure provided by the combination of slats and table support member attached to platform . Additional tools such as vise clamps may be attached to slats to clamp down an object so that it may be secured when cutting or grinding. In practice the number of slats used in an embodiment may differ from the number of slats shown in .

The particular embodiment of illustrates plate with various slots that may be positioned over table support members by the use of bolts and washers inserted through slots and threaded into receiving slots in table support members . For ease illustration these bolts washers and receiving slots are not shown in . For some embodiments the receiving slots in table support members may be aligned along the x axis direction. Plate may hold a commercial vise. Such a vise may hold an object in various positions allowing a high degree of flexibility in orienting an object relative to tool . Plate may be removed to make room for large work pieces that may be held secure against slats .

Additional components may be utilized in an embodiment such as lighting fixtures attached to the device of or perhaps an electrical outlet strip to plug in tool . However such components are not shown in the Figures so as not to obscure the illustrations.

The various component parts described in the embodiments may be manufactured in various ways and may be made out of various materials such as for example metal plastic wood products or various combinations thereof but are not necessarily limited to such materials. A component part as described above may be formed as a single component of the device or a component part may be a composite structure comprising multiple sub components. An embodiment may be sold as a kit to be assembled by the consumer.

It is to be understood that the illustrations described herein are not drawn to scale. Various modifications may be made to the disclosed embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention as claimed below. For example support members and may be fabricated as a single piece of material such as metal. As another example fastening devices other than a wing nut may be used to secure vertical adjustment arms and . Similarly screw may be of various types of screws. As another example for some embodiments support member arms and may be supported by rails and and may slide along rails and by engaging in recessed tracks within rails and . As another example some embodiments may use a single rail in place of rails and .
