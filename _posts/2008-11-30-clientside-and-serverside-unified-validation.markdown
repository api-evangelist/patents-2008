This Application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60 991 764 filed on Dec. 3 2007 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present invention is related to development of Web sites and Web applications. More specifically the present invention relates to validation of client side code and server side code utilizing the same validation code.

Incorrectly written code for a Web application Web page or Web site may not be rendered on a browser. HTML documents must be validated prior to publication of the content of the HTML document on the Web. Validated code code that among other factors adheres to Web standards allows a Web page to load faster and is easier to maintain. Most current HTML documents require separate validation code for the client side and for the server side. For example if the client side code is written in JavaScript and the server side code is written in PHP the client side code is validated using JavaScript and server side code is validated using PHP.

Prior to Rich Internet Applications traditional Web applications involved a client server architecture with all of the processing on the server side and the client side used to display the HTML web pages served by the server. Each time a user desired to view a new Web page a HTTP request was sent to the server and the requested Web page was served to the Web browser on the client side. Such a traditional system is shown in with a Web server on a server side receiving requests over the Internet from a Web browser on a client side.

Rich Internet Applications such as Ajax greatly improved on the traditional client server architecture by allowing the client machine to dynamically render and partially refresh web pages based on an initial set of instructions from the server user input and small amounts of subsequent data dynamically requested from the server. As shown in the client machine processes Ajax instructions to render a Web page for the user.

Early Web applications allowed a user s browser to send a request to a server. The server processed the request and responded to the browser with a Web page. When the user wanted to view a new page another request was sent to the server and the server responded to the browser with a new Web page. Such a process resulted in a waste of bandwidth since much of the Web contents in the first Web page were also contained in the second web page. The need to resend the same information led to a much slower user interface of a Web application than that of a native application.

An emerging technology called Ajax Asynchronous and JavaScript XML was developed for refreshing part of a page instead of refreshing the whole page on every interaction between the user and application. In an Ajax application when a user submits a form in a page a script program usually a JavaScript program resident on the Web browser receives the user s request and sends a XML Extended Markup Language HTTP Hyper Text Transfer Protocol request to the Web server in background so as to retrieve only the needed Web contents instead of the whole page and perform corresponding processing to partly refresh the page when receiving a response from the Web server. In this way the application response time is shortened because the amount of data exchanged between the Web browser and the Web server is greatly reduced. And the processing time of the Web server is saved because much of the processing is performed at the client side.

Ajax is the use of dynamic HTML JavaScript and CSS to create dynamic and usually interactive Web sites and applications. A more detailed explanation of Ajax is set forth in Edmond Woychowsky Prentice Hall 2007 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Applets or Java Applets are mini executable programs named with the .class suffix and are placed on a Web page and provide interactive and multimedia uses.

Application Programming Interface API is a collection of computer software code usually a set of class definitions that can perform a set of related complex tasks but has a limited set of controls that may be manipulated by other software code entities. The set of controls is deliberately limited for the sake of clarity and ease of use so that programmers do not have to work with the detail contained within the given API itself.

An Attribute provides additional information about an element object or file. In a Document Object Model an attribute or attribute node is contained within an element node.

Behavioral layer is the top layer and is the scripting and programming that adds interactivity and dynamic effects to a site.

Binding in a general sense is the linking of a library to an application program usually to prevent repetition of frequently utilized code.

Compiler is a computer program that translates a series of instructions written in one computer language into a resulting output in a different computer language.

Document Object Model DOM Element is an object contained in a Document Object Model DOM . The term DOM is generally used to refer to the particular DOM held in the memory region being used by the Web browser. Such a DOM controls the Graphical Respondent Interface GRI or Graphical User Interface GUI . The DOM is generated according to the information that the Web browser reads from the HTML file and or from direct JavaScript software instructions. Generally there exists a unique DOM element for every unique HTML element. DOM elements are sometimes referred to as HTML DOM elements because the DOM element exists only because HTML code that was read by the Web browser listed some HTML element that had not previously existed and thereby caused the Web browser to create that DOM element. Often specific elements of the greater set of HTML DOM elements are identified by specifying an HTML DOM checkbox element or an HTML DOM text input element. A more detailed explanation of the document object model is set forth in Jeremy Keith friendsof 2005 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

HyperText Markup Language HTML is a method of mixing text and other content with layout and appearance commands in a text file so that a browser can generate a displayed image from the file.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP is a set of conventions for controlling the transfer of information via the Internet from a Web server computer to a client computer and also from a client computer to a Web server.

Internet is the worldwide decentralized totality of server computers and data transmission paths which can supply information to a connected and browser equipped client computer and can receive and forward information entered from the client computer.

JavaScript is an object based programming language. JavaScript is an interpreted language not a compiled language. JavaScript is generally designed for writing software routines that operate within a client computer on the Internet. Generally the software routines are downloaded to the client computer at the beginning of the interactive session if they are not already cached on the client computer. JavaScript is discussed in greater detail below.

JSON is JavaScript Object Notation format which is a way of taking data and turning it into valid JavaScript syntax for reconstituting an object at the other end of the transmission protocol.

MySQL is a relational database management system which relies on SQL for processing data in a database.

Parser is a component of a compiler that analyzes a sequence of tokens to determine its grammatical structure with respect to a given formal grammar. Parsing transforms input text into a data structure usually a tree which is suitable for later processing and which captures the implied hierarchy of the input. XML Parsers ensure that an XML document follows the rules of XML markup syntax correctly.

PHP is a scripting language that allows developers create dynamically generated Web pages and is used for server side programming.

Rendering engine is software used with a Web browser that takes Web content HTML XML image files and formatting information CSS XSL and displays the formatted content on a screen.

Serialization places an object in a binary form for transmission across a network such as the Internet and deserialization involves extracting a data structure from a series of bytes.

SQL Structured Query Language is a computer language designed for data retrieval and data management in a database.

Structural layer of a Web page is the marked up document and foundation on which other layers may be applied.

User is a client computer generally operated by a human being but in some system contexts running an automated process not under full time human control.

Web Browser is a complex software program resident in a client computer that is capable of loading and displaying text and images and exhibiting behaviors as encoded in HTML HyperText Markup Language from the Internet and also from the client computer s memory. Major browsers include MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER NETSCAPE APPLE SAFARI MOZILLA FIREFOX and OPERA.

Web Server is a computer able to simultaneously manage many Internet information exchange processes at the same time. Normally server computers are more powerful than client computers and are administratively and or geographically centralized. An interactive form information collection process generally is controlled from a server computer to which the sponsor of the process has access.

World Wide Web Consortium W3C is an unofficial standards body which creates and oversees the development of web technologies and the application of those technologies.

XHTML Extensible Hypertext Markup Language is a language for describing the content of hypertext documents intended to be viewed or read in a browser.

XML Extensible Markup Language is a W3C standard for text document markup and it is not a language but a set of rules for creating other markup languages.

There are three types of JavaScript 1 Client side JavaScript 2 Server side JavaScript and 3 Core JavaScript. Client side JavaScript is generally an extended version of JavaScript that enables the enhancement and manipulation of web pages and client browsers. Server side JavaScript is an extended version of JavaScript that enables back end access to databases file systems and servers. Core JavaScript is the base JavaScript.

Core JavaScript includes the following objects array date math number and string. Client side JavaScript and Server side JavaScript have additional objects and functions that are specific to client side or server side functionality. Generally any JavaScript libraries .js files created in core JavaScript can be used on both the client and the server without changes. Client side JavaScript is composed of a Core JavaScript and additional objects such as document form frame and window. The objects in Client side JavaScript enable manipulation of HTML documents checking form fields submitting forms creating dynamic pages and the browser directing the browser to load other HTML pages display messages . Server side JavaScript is composed of Core JavaScript and additional objects and functions for accessing databases and file systems and sending email. Server side JavaScript enables Web developers to efficiently create database driven web applications. Server side JavaScript is generally used to create and customize server based applications by scripting the interaction between objects. Client side JavaScript may be served by any server but only displayed by JavaScript enabled browsers. Server side JavaScript must be served by a JavaScript enabled server but can be displayed by any browser.

However current technologies that operate Server side JavaScript fail to offer complete interactions which are the hallmark of rich web sites and applications. A long standing problem in Web development and indeed in any client server situation is the need to have data validation code present both on the client and the server validation on the client is important because it happens very fast and is a part of the GUI which means that it can be very helpful to inform the user of any data errors and help the user to correct them validation on the server is mandatory to ensure that even if the client has been compromised the integrity of the data on the server is assured. But because the client and the server run different validation code there are two sets of validation functions to be kept in sync and they are unlikely to remain so plus one may be vulnerable in ways that the other is not.

The Present Invention overcomes the obstacles of the prior art. With the present invention the same validation code is designated to be available both on the client side and the server side. This may be because literally the same JavaScript code is available from the client and the server or because proxy code is injected into the client that calls the same validation code used on the server. The aforementioned problem is therefore solved.

Note that this can continue to be the case even if the present invention is running on top of another server side software such as PHP or Java. The present invention can be used to filter the data submitted from the client and validate it on the server of the present invention with the same code used for client validation before that data is made available to the underlying PHP or Java.

Proxies are not only generated by explicit developer command but are also generated dynamically based on a set of rules and requirements for either server and or client.

One aspect of the present invention is a method for validating code on a client side and on a server side in a web environment. The method includes providing a JavaScript code on a client side. The method also includes providing a JavaScript code on a server side. The method also includes validating both the JavaScript code on the client side and the JavaScript code on the server side with a single validation code.

In practicing the method a proxy code is preferably injected into the JavaScript code on the client side the proxy code calling the single validation code on the serve side.

The method also includes filtering code submitted from the client side to the server side. The method also includes validating the filtered code. The method also includes submitting the filtered code to a second server side software. The second server side software is JAVA PHP C PYTHON or RUBY.

Another aspect of the present invention is a web environment. The web environment includes a web server comprising a server side JavaScript code a web browser comprising a client side JavaScript code and a single validation code for validating both the server side JavaScript code and the client side JavaScript code.

Another aspect of the present invention is a system for validating code on a client side and on a server side in a web environment. The system includes a web server comprising a server side JavaScript code a web browser comprising a client side JavaScript code and a single validation code for validating both the server side JavaScript code and the client side JavaScript code.

Another aspect of the present invention is a computer program product comprising a JavaScript code for a HTML document and means for validating the JavaScript for the HTML document on a client side and a server side.

To understand the differences between the server and browser sides it s important to keep in mind the page lifecycle. The page request from the browser is received by the Web server which fetches the appropriate HTML document either from the file system or perhaps from another handler such as PHP or Ruby or Java . The Web server Apache server then feeds the document to the script server of the present invention which begins to parse the HTML document.

The resulting HTML page is sent back to the browser as the response to the browser s request. The browser begins to parse the HTML building up the DOM. When the browser encounters tags the browser not only adds them to the DOM but also executes them. External JavaScript code or any other content may also be loaded. The onload event fires. Of course the page is progressively rendered throughout much of this flow and also the user can interact with it.

Callbacks from the browser to server side functions are handled via XMLHttpRequests. When the script server receives such a request it creates a new empty document unless configured to use a different static document . The script server retrieves the saved functions that are needed to be made available during callbacks to this page. If a function called oncallback is found it is executed. This is usually used to create the environment needed during a callback if the saved functions are not enough. The callback function itself is executed. Finally the result of that execution is packaged and returned as the response to the XMLHttpRequest.

While a DOM is available during callback processing it is not serialized as HTML and returned as the response as it was during the regular non callback page processing flow. The DOM on script server and the DOM on the browser typically are not synchronized. Both are created from the same HTML source but they are often subject to processing by different JavaScript code and both come to life at different points in the page lifecycle the DOM on the script server exists temporarily when the page is processed by the script server and is eliminated after it s been serialized into the HTML sent to the browser the DOM in the browser is built on the browser from that HTML and is the DOM that s rendered to the user and with which the end user interacts.

While script server and the browser may well share some code e.g. when using runat both usually the JavaScript code designated to run on script server and interacting with the script server DOM is different than the code designated to run on the client. The latter exists e.g. as a tag in the script server DOM but is not executed in script server.

Remember that the only things sent to the browser at the end of page processing is what s actually in the DOM and what the script server of the present invention has added such as proxies clientData and injected scripts. For example if a developer added an expando property which is an in memory change to the DOM that will not get serialized it will not appear on the client side.

On the browser the div is present with an id of myDiv but without a userId property. For this same reason setting event handlers programmatically rather than in the DOM will not translate to DOM changes and hence will not propagate to the browser. For example with a button 

A developer could add an onclick . . . attribute to the tag but this does not assist with adding the event handler programmatically. The script server of the present invention provides Jaxer.setEvent domElement eventName handler function that does the right thing in the script server as well as on the browser. var btn document.getElementById myButton function sayHi alert hi sayHi.runat client Jaxer.setEvent btn onclick sayHi 

The function used as the event handler should be made available to the browser. When setEvent is executed on the server as above it results in the following change to the myButton element This is sent to the browser since it is a DOM change. If the function passed into setEvent has no name its body source is used as the value of the attribute var btn document.getEleemntById myButton Jaxer.setEvent btn onclick function alert hi 

Which is useful for short functions but is easier to pass in the code to execute as a string var btn document.getEleemntById myButton Jaxer.setEvent btn onclick alert hi 

The environment of the present invention is preferably based upon the very same Mozilla engine which powers Firefox 3. This means that for the most part DOM interaction in the server using the present invention is the same as interacting with the DOM in a Web browser. It parses and executes pages progressively building up the DOM as it goes along and allowing JavaScript to interact with whatever DOM has already been built up at the time the JavaScript executes. Any document.write calls will write to the DOM immediately following the current location on the page. The JavaScript that is part of a page and loaded into the page executes within the context of the global window object. For each request at the server the present invention preferably provides a document object model. This DOM which we ll refer to as DOM1 can be used to insert data and otherwise transform the page before it is first returned to the browser. You interact with and manipulate the DOM much the same as you would in the browser. Some third party Javascript toolkits such as jQuery can also be used to modify this DOM. The document is accessible through the document object and the root element of the DOM is accessible through the document.documentElement object. To ensure that element properties are serialized properly when the DOM is returned to the browser use element.setAttribute attr value rather than element.foo value . Form element values set with formElement.value code font are an exception they ll still be serialized as expected. To attach an event handler to an element preferably use the special Jaxer method Jaxer.setEvent . Example Transforming the DOM.

Having briefly described the present invention the above and further objects features and advantages thereof will be recognized by those skilled in the pertinent art from the following detailed description of the invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

As shown in a system of the invention generally includes a server side a client side and a network or preferably the Internet . The server side includes a web server a handler and a JavaScript server preferably having a server core and a server framework . The client side includes a Web browser has a client framework a client side JavaScript code and a rendering engine . The server framework accesses filesystems and databases as well as the Internet . A more detailed description of the abilities of the running JavaScript on the server side and client side is disclosed in Colton et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 270 817 filed Nov. 13 2008 for A Web Server Based On The Same Paradigms As Web Clients which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. An additional detail of facilitated server side to client side communications is disclosed in Colton et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 276 327 filed Nov. 22 2008 for a System And Method For Facilitated Client Side To server Side Communications which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

In the system is shown during a callback operation. The callback begins at the client side JavaScript code with a callback request sent to the client framework . A HTTP GET request is transmitted over the Internet to the server side and received at the Web server . The HTTP GET request is sent to the server core which sends the HTTP GET request as a callback to the server framework . The server framework receives the callback deserializes performs the get functions invokes serializes and sends the response to the callback to the server core . The server core sends the response to the Web server which sends the response over the Internet to client framework on the Web browser .

In the system is shown during a normal process. The process begins with a HTTP GET request for a Web page sent over the Internet from the Web browser on the client side to the server side . The HTTP Request is sent to the handler server . The HTML Web page is then sent to the script server architecture . The server core of the script server architecture parses the HTML Web page to create a HTML DOM of the HTML Web page. The server core also parses and interprets the JavaScript of the HTML Web page. The server framework accesses databases and filesystems to respond to the Requests for the HTML Web page. The server framework also injects proxies to modify the HTML Web page. The server core serializes the DOM back to the HTML Web page and the web server transmits the HTML Web page to the client side where the Web browser renders the HTML Web page for display for a user. As shown in a Web server e.g. apache server receives a request from the client side. The request is sent to the handler server PHP Ruby or Java language . The handler server feeds the HTML document to script server core which begins to parse the HTML document thereby building the DOM tree for the HTML document on the server side. Events and callbacks are sent to the script server framework . The script server adds tags to the DOM and executes them if the has a runat attribute that indicates the should be run on the server. During the parsing and execution external content from filesystems databases and the like are fetched and loaded into the HTML document. After the DOM is loaded the onserverload event is fired from the script server framework . The script server architecture post processes the DOM to perform its built in logic and prepare the DOM for transmission to the client side. This post process includes removing block meant only for the server replacing function to be proxied with proxies saving functions that should be available as callbacks and the like. The DOM is serialized back to HTML and the HTML is streamed back via the web server to the browser. A more detailed explanation of event driven JavaScript architecture is set forth in Colton et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 273 539 filed on Nov. 18 2008 for a Flexible Event Driven JavaScript Server Architecture which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. A more detailed explanation of on the fly processing is set forth in Colton et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 276 337 filed on Nov. 22 2008 for a System And Method For On The Fly Post Processing Document Object Model Manipulation which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

As shown in the present invention allows the server to execute the JavaScript functions that are set to runat server or runat both . These functions might call databases file systems communicate across network sockets or get session data. And since the server side engine has a HTML DOM just like the browser the HTML page can be manipulated through standard DOM APIs and your favorite Ajax libraries. The present invention also has session objects that can be used to persist data for users during a session or transaction. Any functions set to runat server are stripped from what gets sent to the browser . Specifically at 1 the page executes on the server and a resulting HTML page is sent to the browser . A more detailed description of the runat function is set forth in Colton et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 270 868 filed on Nov. 14 2008 for a System And Method For Tagging Code To Determine Where The Code Runs which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

After server sends the resulting HTML page to the browser at 2 the browser interprets the HTML page and executes the JavaScript within the HTML page. If JavaScript functions tagged to runat server proxy are included then the present invention automatically strips out the bodies of those functions and replaces the bodies with a new functions by the same name that know how to invoke the original function on the server using Ajax calls and return the result either synchronously or asynchronously. Ajax communications do not need to be written using the present invention. Any functions not tagged with a runat attribute or set to runat client or runat both are processed by the browser .

Any functions set to runat server proxy can now be called from the browser . The function is called as if it were running on the browser and the present invention automatically via XHR communications with the server marshals the parameters to the server where the function executes calling databases getting info from the session data etc. . . . and returns the result to the browser . The server proxy functions can be invoked either synchronously or asynchronously. At 3 the browser calls the server asynchronously for new information.

The server computer program of the present invention is pre configured for preferable use as a plug in to the APACHE 2.x web server. To provide standards compliant JavaScript and DOM capabilities server side the server computer program is built on the MOZILLA engine which is the same engine used in the popular FIREFOX browser. The server computer program of the present invention is layered into APACHE as an input and output filter for use to modify dynamic pages created by other languages such as PHP or Ruby.

The server computer program of the present invention is preferably a combination of C C Core code and a server side JavaScript Framework. The server core provides the JavaScript parser and runtime HTML parser and DOM engine and an event architecture that calls the server framework as the document is being processed on the server side . The server framework provides the logic for example deciding which code to run on the server side and which on the client side creating proxies on the client side for callable server side functions serializing and deserializing data and other related activities. A more detailed description of generating proxies is set forth in Colton et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 275 182 filed on Nov. 20 2008 for a System And Method For Auto Generating JavaScript Proxies And Meta Proxies which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Further discussions on proxy generation are set forth in Colton et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 275 213 filed on Nov. 20 2008 for a Single Proxy Generation For Multiple Web Pages which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. A more detailed description of accessing the DOM on the server side is set forth in Colton et al. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 277 336 filed on Nov. 22 2008 for a System And Method For Accessibility Of Document Object Model And JavaScript By Other Platforms which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

On the server side a developer s JavaScript environment is enhanced by the server framework which provides access to the database e.g. MySQL file system network the HTTP Request and Response data and the external server side platforms such as Java PHP and Ruby.

An example of code written by a developer and prior to processing by the present invention is set forth below.

Processing of the code by the present invention results in the code being formatted as set forth below 

As shown in a server computer contains server architecture . The server architecture includes the server core and the server framework . The server core includes a JavaScript parser . The server computer is preferably a conventional server computer available from IBM HP APPLE DELL and SUN.

As shown in a user computer contains a Web browser . The Web browser preferably includes the client framework client side JavaScript code and the rendering engine . The user computer is preferably a conventional user computer such as a PC available from HP DELL and GATEWAY or a MAC available from APPLE. The Web browser is preferably MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER NETSCAPE APPLE SAFARI MOZILLA FIREFOX or OPERA.

A general method of the present invention is shown in . At block a single block of JavaScript code having a runat attribute of both is provided on a server side. At block the single block of JavaScript code is run on the server side. At block the single block of JavaScript code is called to the client side. At block the single block of JavaScript code is run on the client side. Preferably the single block of code is a validation code. The runat attribute of both means single block of code can run on both the server side and the client side.

A more specific method of the present invention is shown in . At block a JavaScript code of a HTML document is provided on a client side. At block a JavaScript code of the HTML document is provided on a server side. At block both the JavaScript code on the client side and the JavaScript code on the server side are validated with a single validation code.

A more specific method of the present invention is shown in . At block a proxy code is injected into a JavaScript code of a HTML page. The proxy code calls a single validation code on a server side for validating a JavaScript code on the server side. At block the JavaScript code with the proxy code is provided on a client side. At block the proxy code calls the single validation code on the server side. At block the single validation code of the server side validates the JavaScript code on the client side.

With the present invention a developer can also tag any function or block of functions to run on both the server and the browser. Developers can write logic once and it can be executed from either location. One ideal use of this is data validation. A developer can validate forms on the client to provide instant user feedback and once the form is successfully submitted validate the form again on the server to ensure its integrity using the exact same logic with no additional code rewriting and no getting the client side code and the server side code out of sync and possibly opening security holes. The following is a validation code
