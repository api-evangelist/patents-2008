The present invention relates to TR17 a novel member of the tumor necrosis factor family of receptors. More specifically isolated nucleic acid molecules are provided encoding TR17. TR17 polypeptides are also provided as are vectors host cells and recombinant and synthetic methods for producing the same. The invention also relates to diagnostic and therapeutic methods using TR17 nucleic acid molecules and or polypeptides. The invention further relates to screening methods for identifying agonists and antagonists of TR17 activity.

Many biological actions for instance response to certain stimuli and natural biological processes are controlled by factors such as cytokines. Many cytokines act through receptors by engaging the receptor and producing an intra cellular response.

For example tumor necrosis factors TNF alpha and beta are cytokines which act through TNF receptors to regulate numerous biological processes including protection against infection and induction of shock and inflammatory disease. The TNF molecules belong to the TNF ligand superfamily and act together with their receptors or counter ligands the TNF receptor superfamily. So far nine members of the TNF ligand superfamily have been identified and ten members of the TNF receptor superfamily have been characterized.

Among the ligands there are included TNF alpha lymphotoxin alpha LT alpha also known as TNF LT found in complex heterotrimer LT 2 FasL CD40L CD27L CD30L 4 1BBL OX40L and nerve growth factor NGF . The superfamily of TNF receptors includes the p55TNF receptor p75TNF receptor TNF receptor related protein FAS antigen or APO 1 CD40 CD27 CD30 4 1BB OX40 low affinity p75 and NGF receptor A. Meager 22 291 295 1994 .

Many members of the TNF ligand superfamily are expressed by activated T cells implying that they are necessary for T cell interactions with other cell types which underlie cell ontogeny and functions. A. Meager supra .

Considerable insight into the essential functions of several members of the TNF receptor family has been gained from the identification and creation of mutants that abolish the expression of these proteins. For example naturally occurring mutations in the FAS antigen and its ligand cause lymphoproliferative disease R. Watanabe Fukunaga et al. 356 314 1992 perhaps reflecting a failure of programmed cell death. Mutations of the CD40 ligand cause an X linked immunodeficiency state characterized by high levels of immunoglobulin M and low levels of immunoglobulin G in plasma indicating faulty T cell dependent B cell activation R. C. Allen et al. 259 990 1993 . Targeted mutations of the low affinity nerve growth factor receptor cause a disorder characterized by faulty sensory innovation of peripheral structures K. F. Lee et al. 69 737 1992 .

TNF alpha and LT alpha are capable of binding to two TNF receptors the 55 and 75 kd TNF receptors . A large number of biological effects elicited by TNF and LT alpha acting through their receptors include hemorrhagic necrosis of transplanted tumors cytotoxicity a role in endotoxic shock inflammation immunoregulation proliferation and anti viral responses as well as protection against the deleterious effects of ionizing radiation. TNF alpha and LT alpha are involved in the pathogenesis of a wide range of diseases including endotoxic shock cerebral malaria tumors autoimmune disease AIDS and graft host rejection B. Beutler and C. Von Huffel 264 667 668 1994 . Mutations in the p55 receptor cause increased susceptibility to microbial infection.

Moreover an about 80 amino acid domain near the C terminus of TNFR1 p55 and Fas was reported as the death domain which is responsible for transducing signals for programmed cell death Tartaglia et al. 74 845 1993 .

Apoptosis or programmed cell death is a physiologic process essential to the normal development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms H. Steller 267 1445 1449 1995 . Derangements of apoptosis contribute to the pathogenesis of several human diseases including cancer neurodegenerative disorders and acquired immune deficiency syndrome C. B. Thompson 267 1456 1462 1995 . Recently much attention has focused on the signal transduction and biological function of two cell surface death receptors Fas APO 1 and TNFR 1 J. L. Cleveland et al. 81 479 482 1995 A. Fraser et al. 85 781 784 1996 S Nagata et al 267 1449 56 1995 . Both are members of the TNF receptor family which also include TNFR 2 low affinity NGFR CD40 and CD30 among others C. A. Smith et al. 248 1019 23 1990 M. Tewari et al in M. Purton Heldin Carl Ed. Chapman and Hall London 1995 . While family members are defined by the presence of cysteine rich repeats in their extracellular domains Fas APO 1 and TNFR 1 also share a region of intracellular homology appropriately designated the death domain which is distantly related to the suicide gene reaper P. Golstein et al. 81 185 6 1995 K. White et al 264 677 83 1994 . This shared death domain suggests that both receptors interact with a related set of signal transducing molecules that until recently remained unidentified. Activation of Fas APO 1 recruits the death domain containing adapter molecule FADD MORT1 A. M. Chinnaiyan et al. 81 505 512 1995 M. P. Boldin et al. 270 7795 8 1995 F. C. Kischkel et al. 14 5579 5588 1995 which in turn binds and presumably activates FLICE MACH1 a member of the ICE CED 3 family of pro apoptotic proteases M. Muzio et al. 85 817 827 1996 M. P. Boldin et al. 85 803 815 1996 . While the central role of Fas APO 1 is to trigger cell death TNFR 1 can signal an array of diverse biological activities many of which stem from its ability to activate NF kB L. A. Tartaglia et al. 13 151 153 1992 . Accordingly TNFR 1 recruits the multivalent adapter molecule TRADD which like FADD also contains a death domain H. Hsu et al. 81 495 504 1995 H. Hsu et al. 84 299 308 1996 . Through its associations with a number of signaling molecules including FADD TRAF2 and RIP TRADD can signal both apoptosis and NF kB activation H. Hsu et al. 84 299 308 1996 H. Hsu et al. 4 387 396 1996 .

Recently a new apoptosis inducing TNF ligand has been discovered. S. R. Wiley et al. 3 673 682 1995 named the new molecule TNF related apoptosis inducing ligand or TRAIL. R. M. Pitti et al. 271 12687 12690 1996 named the molecule Apo 2 ligand or Apo 2L. This molecule was also disclosed in co pending U.S. provisional patent application No. 60 013 405. For convenience this molecule will be referred to herein as TRAIL.

Unlike FAS ligand whose transcripts appear to be largely restricted to stimulated T cells significant levels of TRAIL are detected in many human tissues e.g. spleen lung prostate thymus ovary small intestine colon peripheral blood lymphocytes placenta kidney and it is constitutively transcribed by some cell lines. It has been shown that TRAIL acts independently from the FAS ligand S. R. Wiley et al. supra . It has also been shown that TRAIL activates apoptosis rapidly within a time frame that is similar to death signaling by Fas Apo 1L but much faster than TNF induced apoptosis. S. A. Marsters et al. 6 750 752 1996 . The inability of TRAIL to bind TNFR 1 Fas or the recently identified DR3 suggests that TRAIL may interact with a unique receptor s . Work to date suggests that there are several unique TNF receptors for TRAIL see e.g. Pan et al. Science 277 815 821 1997 .

The effects of TNF family ligands and receptors are varied and influence numerous functions both normal and abnormal in the biological processes of the mammalian system. There is a clear need therefore for identification and characterization of such receptors and ligands that influence biological activity both normally and in disease states.

The present invention provides isolated nucleic acid molecules comprising a polynucleotide encoding at least a portion of TR17. Thus the present invention provides isolated nucleic acid molecules comprising a polynucleotide encoding the TR17 receptor having the amino acid sequence shown in in SEQ ID NO 2 .

The present invention also relates to recombinant vectors which include the isolated nucleic acid molecules of the present invention and to host cells containing the recombinant vectors as well as to methods of making such vectors and host cells and for using them for production of TR17 polypeptides or peptides by recombinant techniques.

The invention further provides an isolated TR17 polypeptide having an amino acid sequence encoded by a polynucleotide described herein.

The present invention also provides diagnostic assays such as quantitative and diagnostic assays for detecting levels of TR17 protein. Thus for instance a diagnostic assay in accordance with the invention for detecting over expression of TR17 or soluble form thereof compared to normal control tissue samples may be used to detect the presence of tumors.

Tumor Necrosis Factor TNF family ligands are known to be among the most pleiotropic cytokines inducing a large number of cellular responses including cell proliferation cytotoxicity anti viral activity immunoregulatory activities hematopoiesis and the transcriptional regulation of several genes. Cellular response to TNF family ligands include not only normal physiological responses but also diseases associated with increased apoptosis or the inhibition of apoptosis. Apoptosis programmed cell death is a physiological mechanism involved in the deletion of peripheral T lymphocytes of the immune system and its dysregulation can lead to a number of different pathogenic processes. Diseases associated with increased cell survival unregulated cell proliferation or the inhibition of apoptosis include cancers autoimmune disorders viral infections inflammation graft vs. host disease acute graft rejection and chronic graft rejection. Diseases associated with increased apoptosis include AIDS neurodegenerative disorders myelodysplastic syndromes ischemic injury toxin induced liver disease septic shock cachexia and anorexia.

Thus the invention further provides a method comprising cells which express the TR17 polypeptide with a candidate compound and a TNF family ligand e.g. Neutrokine alpha or APRIL International Publication Number WO 97 33902 188 6 1185 1190 1998 and assaying for the inhibition of TR17 mediated signalling induced by a TNF family ligand e.g. Neutrokine alpha and APRIL which involves administering to a cell which expresses the TR17 polypeptide an effective amount of a TR17 agonist capable of decreasing TR17 mediated signalling.

In a further aspect the present invention is directed to a method for enhancing TR17 mediated signalling induced by a TNF family ligand e.g. Neutrokine alpha and APRIL which involves administering to a cell which expresses the TR17 polypeptide an effective amount of a TR17 agonist or antagonist capable of increasing TR17 mediated signalling.

Whether any candidate agonist or antagonist of the present invention can enhance or inhibit TR17 mediated signalling can be determined using art known TNF family ligand receptor cellular response assays including those described in more detail below see e.g. Examples 13 and 14 . Thus in a further aspect a screening method is provided for determining whether a candidate agonist or antagonist is capable of enhancing or inhibiting a TR17 mediated cellular response to a TNF family ligand. The method involves contacting cellular response and comparing the cellular response to a standard cellular response the standard being assayed when contact is made with the ligand in absence of the candidate compound whereby an increased cellular response over the standard indicates that the candidate compound is an agonist of the ligand receptor signaling pathway and a decreased cellular response compared to the standard indicates that the candidate compound is an antagonist of the ligand receptor signaling pathway. By the invention a cell expressing the TR17 polypeptide can be contacted with either an endogenous or exogenously administered TNF family ligand.

The present invention provides isolated nucleic acid molecules comprising a polynucleotide encoding a TR17 polypeptide having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 2 .

The determined nucleotide sequence of the TR17 cDNA of SEQ ID NO 1 contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of about 293 amino acid residues with a deduced molecular weight of about 31.8 kDa. The amino acid sequence of the predicted mature TR17 receptor is shown in SEQ ID NO 2 from amino acid residue about 1 to residue about 293.

As indicated the present invention also provides the mature form s of the TR17 receptors of the present invention. According to the signal hypothesis proteins secreted by mammalian cells have a signal or secretory leader sequence which is cleaved from the mature protein once export of the growing protein chain across the rough endoplasmic reticulum has been initiated. Most mammalian cells and even insect cells cleave secreted proteins with the same specificity. However in some cases cleavage of a secreted protein is not entirely uniform which results in two or more mature species on the protein. Further it has long been known that the cleavage specificity of a secreted protein is ultimately determined by the primary structure of the complete protein that is it is inherent in the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide.

The present invention provides a nucleotide sequence encoding the mature TR17 polypeptide having the amino acid sequence shown in . By the mature TR17 protein having the amino acid sequence shown in is meant the mature form s of the TR17 receptor predicted by computer analysis or produced by expression of the coding sequence shown in in a mammalian cell e.g. COS cells as described below . As indicated below the mature TR17 receptor having the amino acid sequence encoded by the coding sequence shown in may or may not differ from the predicted mature TR17 protein shown in amino acids from about 1 to about 293 depending on the accuracy of the predicted cleavage site based on computer analysis.

Methods for predicting whether a protein has a secretory leader as well as the cleavage point for that leader sequence are available. For instance the method of McGeoch 3 271 286 1985 and von Heinje 14 4683 4690 1986 can be used. The accuracy of predicting the cleavage points of known mammalian secretory proteins for each of these methods is in the range of 75 80 . von Heinje supra. However the two methods do not always produce the same predicted cleavage point s for a given protein.

As one of ordinary skill would appreciate due to the possibilities of sequencing errors as well as the variability of cleavage sites for leaders in different known proteins the predicted TR17 polypeptide comprises about 293 amino acids but may be anywhere in the range of 283 303 amino acids. It will further be appreciated that the domains described herein have been predicted by computer analysis and accordingly that depending on the analytical criteria used for identifying various functional domains the exact address of for example the extracellular domain intracellular domain cysteine rich motifs and transmembrane domain of TR17 may differ slightly. For example the exact location of the TR17 extracellular domain in SEQ ID NO 2 may vary slightly e.g. the address may shift by about 1 to about 20 residues more likely about 1 to about 5 residues depending on the criteria used to define the domain. In any event as discussed further below the invention further provides polypeptides having various residues deleted from the N terminus and or C terminus of the complete TR17 including polypeptides lacking one or more amino acids from the N termini of the TR17 extracellular domains described herein which constitute soluble forms of the extracellular domain of the TR17 polypeptides respectively.

As indicated nucleic acid molecules of the present invention may be in the form of RNA such as mRNA or in the form of DNA including for instance cDNA and genomic DNA obtained by cloning or produced synthetically. The DNA may be double stranded or single stranded. Single stranded DNA may be the coding strand also known as the sense strand or it may be the non coding strand also referred to as the anti sense strand.

By isolated nucleic acid molecule s is intended a nucleic acid molecule DNA or RNA which has been removed from its native environment. For example recombinant DNA molecules contained in a vector are considered isolated for the purposes of the present invention. Further examples of isolated DNA molecules include recombinant DNA molecules maintained in heterologous host cells or purified partially or substantially DNA molecules in solution. Isolated RNA molecules include in vivo or in vitro RNA transcripts of the DNA molecules of the present invention. Isolated nucleic acid molecules according to the present invention further include such molecules produced synthetically. However a nucleic acid molecule contained in a clone that is a member of a mixed clone library e.g. a genomic or cDNA library and that has not been isolated from other clones of the library e.g. in the form of a homogeneous solution containing the clone without other members of the library or a chromosome isolated or removed from a cell or a cell lysate e.g. a chromosome spread as in a karyotype is not isolated for the purposes of this invention.

Isolated nucleic acid molecules of the present invention include DNA molecules comprising an open reading frame ORF shown in SEQ ID NO 1 DNA molecules comprising the coding sequence for the complete full length and or mature TR17 protein shown in SEQ ID NO 2 and DNA molecules which comprise a sequence substantially different from those described above but which due to the degeneracy of the genetic code still encode the TR17 protein. Of course the genetic code is well known in the art. Thus it would be routine for one skilled in the art to generate such degenerate variants.

The invention further provides an isolated nucleic acid molecule having the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 1 or a nucleic acid molecule having a sequence complementary thereto. Such isolated molecules particularly DNA molecules are useful for example as probes for gene mapping by in situ hybridization with chromosomes and for detecting expression of the TR17 gene in human tissue for instance by Northern blot analysis.

The present invention is further directed to fragments of the isolated nucleic acid molecules described herein. By a fragment of an isolated DNA molecule having the nucleotide sequence of the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 1 is intended DNA fragments at least about 15 nt and more preferably at least about 20 nt at least about 24 nt still more preferably at least about 30 nt and even more preferably at least about 40 nt at least about 50 nt at least about 100 nt at least about 150 nt at least about 200 nt at least about 250 nt at least about 300 nt in length which are useful for example as diagnostic probes and primers as discussed herein. Of course larger fragments 350 1500 nt in length are also useful according to the present invention as are fragments corresponding to most if not all of the nucleotide sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO 1 or the complementary strand thereto. By a fragment at least 20 nt in length for example is intended fragments which include 20 or more contiguous bases from the nucleotide sequence of the nucleotide sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO 1 . In this context about includes the particularly recited size larger or smaller by several 5 4 3 2 or 1 nucleotides at either terminus or at both termini. In specific embodiments the fragments of the invention comprise or alternatively consist of nucleotides 13 to 33 97 to 108 169 to 180 214 to 234 313 to 330 343 to 402 418 to 444 556 to 648 664 to 684 712 to 732 754 to 765 and 856 to 870 of SEQ ID NO 1 or the complementary strand thereto. Polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotide fragments are also encompassed.

Representative examples of TR17 polynucleotide fragments of the invention include for example fragments that comprise or alternatively consist of a sequence from about nucleotide 1 to 33 34 to 66 67 to 96 97 to 141 142 to 174 175 to 198 199 to 207 208 to 264 265 to 312 313 to 354 355 to 390 391 to 423 424 to 495 496 to 558 559 to 579 580 to 621 622 to 660 661 to 708 709 to 750 751 to 810 811 to 849 and or 850 to 879 of SEQ ID NO 1 or the complementary strand thereto. In this context about includes the particularly recited ranges larger or smaller by several 5 4 3 2 or 1 nucleotides at either terminus or at both termini.

In specific embodiments the polynucleotide fragments of the invention comprise or alternatively consist of a sequence from nucleotide 97 to 198 and or 208 to 312 of SEQ ID NO 1 or the complementary strand thereto.

Preferably the polynucleotide fragments of the invention encode a polypeptide which demonstrates a TR17 functional activity. By a polypeptide demonstrating a TR17 functional activity is meant a polypeptide capable of displaying one or more known functional activities associated with a full length complete TR17 protein. Such functional activities include but are not limited to biological activity e.g. ability to activate transcription factors NF AT AP 1 and or NFKB antigenicity ability to bind or compete with a TR17 polypeptide for binding to an anti TR17 antibody immunogenicity ability to generate antibody which binds to a TR17 polypeptide ability to form multimers with TR17 polypeptides of the invention and ability to bind to a receptor or ligand for a TR17 polypeptide e.g. Neutrokine alpha International Publication Number WO 98 18921 and APRIL International Publication Number WO 97 33902188 6 1185 1190 1998 .

The functional activity of TR17 polypeptides and fragments variants derivatives and analogs thereof can be assayed by various methods.

For example in one embodiment where one is assaying for the ability to bind or compete with full length TR17 polypeptides for binding to anti TR17 antibody various immunoassays known in the art can be used including but not limited to competitive and non competitive assay systems using techniques such as radioimmunoassays ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay sandwich immunoassays immunoradiometric assays gel diffusion precipitation reactions immunodiffusion assays in situ immunoassays using colloidal gold enzyme or radioisotope labels for example western blots precipitation reactions agglutination assays e.g. gel agglutination assays hemagglutination assays complement fixation assays immunofluorescence assays protein A assays and immunoelectrophoresis assays etc. In one embodiment antibody binding is detected by detecting a label on the primary antibody. In another embodiment the primary antibody is detected by detecting binding of a secondary antibody or reagent to the primary antibody. In a further embodiment the secondary antibody is labeled. Many means are known in the art for detecting binding in an immunoassay and are within the scope of the present invention.

In another embodiment where a TR17 ligand is identified e.g. Neutrokine alpha and APRIL or the ability of a polypeptide fragment variant or derivative of the invention to multimerize is being evaluated binding can be assayed e.g. by means well known in the art such as for example reducing and non reducing gel chromatography protein affinity chromatography and affinity blotting. See generally Phizicky E. et al 59 94 123 1995 . In another embodiment physiological correlates of TR17 binding to its substrates signal transduction can be assayed.

In addition assays described herein and otherwise known in the art may routinely be applied to measure the ability of TR17 polypeptides and fragments variants derivatives and analogs thereof to elicit TR17 related biological activity. For example techniques described herein see e.g. Examples 12 13 and 14 and otherwise known in the art may be applied or routinely modified to assay for the ability of the compositions of the invention to inhibit or stimulate B cell proliferation e.g. Neutrokine alpha mediated B cell proliferation and APRIL mediated B cell proliferation .

Preferred nucleic acid fragments of the present invention include nucleic acid molecules encoding a member selected from the group a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of the TR17 receptor extracellular domain amino acid residues from about 1 to about 165 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of the TR17 cysteine rich domain amino acid residues from about 33 to about 104 in SEQ ID NO 2 or one or more TR17 cysteine rich motifs amino acid residues from about 33 to 66 and or 70 to 104 of SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of the TR17 transmembrane domain amino acid residues from about 166 to about 186 in SEQ ID NO 2 and or a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of the TR17 intracellular domain amino acid residues from about 187 to about 293 in SEQ ID NO 2 . Since the location of these domains have been predicted by computer analysis one of ordinary skill would appreciate that the amino acid residues constituting these domains may vary slightly e.g. by about 1 to 15 amino acid residues depending on the criteria used to define each domain.

Preferred nucleic acid fragments of the invention encode a full length TR17 polypeptide lacking the nucleotides encoding the amino terminal methionine in SEQ ID NO 1 as it is known that the methionine is cleaved naturally and such sequences may be useful in genetically engineering TR17 expression vectors. Polypeptides encoded by such polynucleotides are also contemplated by the invention.

Preferred nucleic acid fragments of the present invention further include nucleic acid molecules encoding epitope bearing portions of the TR17 receptor proteins. In particular such nucleic acid fragments of the present invention include nucleic acid molecules encoding a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 13 to about 33 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 97 to about 108 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 169 to about 180 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 214 to about 234 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 313 to about 330 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 343 to about 402 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 418 to about 444 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 556 to about 648 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 664 to about 684 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 712 to about 732 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 754 to about 765 in SEQ ID NO 2 and a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 856 to about 870 in SEQ ID NO 2 . In this context the inventors have determined that the above polypeptide fragments are antigenic regions of the TR17 proteins. Methods for determining other such epitope bearing portions of the TR17 proteins are described in detail below.

It is believed that the extracellular cysteine rich motifs of TR17 disclosed in are important for interactions between TR17 and its ligands e.g. Neutrokine alpha and APRIL . Accordingly specific embodiments of the invention are directed to polynucleotides encoding polypeptides which comprise or alternatively consist of the amino acid sequence of amino acid residues 33 to 66 and or 70 to 104 of SEQ ID NO 2 . In a specific embodiment the polynucleotides encoding TR17 polypeptides of the invention comprise or alternatively consist of one or both of the extracellular cysteine rich motifs disclosed in . Polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides are also encompassed by the invention.

In additional embodiments the polynucleotides of the invention encode functional attributes of TR17. Preferred embodiments of the invention in this regard include fragments that comprise alpha helix and alpha helix forming regions alpha regions beta sheet and beta sheet forming regions beta regions turn and turn forming regions turn regions coil and coil forming regions coil regions hydrophilic regions hydrophobic regions alpha amphipathic regions beta amphipathic regions flexible regions surface forming regions and high antigenic index regions of TR17.

The data representing the structural or functional attributes of TR17 set forth in and or Table I as described above was generated using the various modules and algorithms of the DNA STAR set on default parameters. In a preferred embodiment the data presented in columns VIII XI XIII and XIV of Table I can be used to determine regions of TR17 which exhibit a high degree of potential for antigenicity. Regions of high antigenicity are determined from the data presented in columns VIII XI XIII and or XIV by choosing values which represent regions of the polypeptide which are likely to be exposed on the surface of the polypeptide in an environment in which antigen recognition may occur in the process of initiation of an immune response.

Certain preferred regions in these regards are set out in but may as shown in Table I be represented or identified by using tabular representations of the data presented in . The DNA STAR computer algorithm used to generate set on the original default parameters was used to present the data in in a tabular format See Table I . The tabular format of the data in may be used to easily determine specific boundaries of a preferred region.

The above mentioned preferred regions set out in and in Table I include but are not limited to regions of the aforementioned types identified by analysis of the amino acid sequences set out in . As set out in and in Table I such preferred regions include Garnier Robson alpha regions beta regions turn regions and coil regions Chou Fasman alpha regions beta regions and turn regions Kyte Doolittle hydrophilic regions Hopp Woods hydrophobic regions Eisenberg alpha and beta amphipathic regions Karplus Schulz flexible regions Jameson Wolf regions of high antigenic index and Emini surface forming regions.

In another aspect the invention provides an isolated nucleic acid molecule comprising a polynucleotide which hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a portion of the polynucleotide in a nucleic acid molecule of the invention described above for instance the complementary strand of nucleotides 13 to 33 97 to 108 169 to 180 214 to 234 313 to 330 343 to 402 418 to 444 556 to 648 664 to 684 712 to 732 754 to 765 and or 856 to 870 of SEQ ID NO 1. By stringent hybridization conditions is intended overnight incubation at 42 C. in a solution comprising 50 formamide 5 SSC 750 mM NaCl 75 mM trisodium citrate 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.6 5 Denhardt s solution 10 dextran sulfate and 20 g ml denatured sheared salmon sperm DNA followed by washing the filters in 0.1 SSC at about 65 C. Polypeptides encoded by these nucleic acids are also encompassed by the invention.

By a polynucleotide which hybridizes to a portion of a polynucleotide is intended a polynucleotide either DNA or RNA hybridizing to at least about 15 nucleotides nt and more preferably at least about 20 nt still more preferably at least about 30 nt and even more preferably about 30 70 nt of the reference polynucleotide. These are useful for example as diagnostic probes and primers as discussed above and in more detail below. In this context about includes the particularly recited size larger or smaller by several 5 4 3 2 or 1 nucleotides at either terminus or at both termini.

By a portion of a polynucleotide of at least 20 nt in length for example is intended 20 or more contiguous nucleotides from the nucleotide sequence of the reference polynucleotide e.g. the nucleotide sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO 1 .

Of course a polynucleotide which hybridizes only to a poly A sequence such as the 3 terminal poly A tract of the TR17 cDNA shown in SEQ ID NO 1 or to a complementary stretch of T or U resides would not be included in a polynucleotide of the invention used to hybridize to a portion of a nucleic acid of the invention since such a polynucleotide would hybridize to any nucleic acid molecule containing a poly A stretch or the complement thereof e.g. practically any double stranded cDNA clone generated using oligo dT as a primer .

In specific embodiments the polynucleotides of the invention are less than 110000 kb 50000 kb 10000 kb 1000 kb 500 kb 400 kb 350 kb 300 kb 250 kb 200 kb 175 kb 150 kb 125 kb 100 kb 75 kb 50 kb 40 kb 30 kb 25 kb 20 kb 15 kb 10 kb 7.5 kb or 5 kb in length.

In further embodiments polynucleotides of the invention comprise at least 15 at least 30 at least 50 at least 100 or at least 250 at least 500 or at least 1000 contiguous nucleotides of TR17 coding sequence but consist of less than or equal to 107 kb 75 kb 50 kb 30 kb 25 kb 20 kb 15 kb 10 kb or 5 kb of genomic DNA that flanks the 5 or 3 coding nucleotide set forth in SEQ ID NO 1 . In further embodiments polynucleotides of the invention comprise at least 15 at least 30 at least 50 at least 100 or at least 250 at least 500 or at least 1000 contiguous nucleotides of TR17 and or coding sequence but do not comprise all or a portion of any TR17 intron. In another embodiment the nucleic acid comprising TR17 coding sequence does not contain coding sequences of a genomic flanking gene i.e. 5 or 3 to the TR17 gene in the genome . In other embodiments the polynucleotides of the invention do not contain the coding sequence of more than 1000 500 250 100 50 25 20 15 10 5 4 3 2 or 1 genomic flanking gene s .

As indicated nucleic acid molecules of the present invention which encode a TR17 polypeptide may include but are not limited to the coding sequence for the mature polypeptide by itself the coding sequence for the mature polypeptide and additional sequences such as those encoding a leader or secretory sequence such as a pre or pro or prepro protein sequence the coding sequence of the mature polypeptide with or without the aforementioned additional coding sequences together with additional non coding sequences including for example but not limited to introns and non coding 5 and 3 sequences such as the transcribed non translated sequences that play a role in transcription mRNA processing including splicing and polyadenylation signals for example ribosome binding and stability of mRNA additional coding sequence which codes for additional amino acids such as those which provide additional functionalities. Thus for instance the polypeptide may be fused to a marker sequence such as a peptide which facilitates purification of the fused polypeptide. In certain preferred embodiments of this aspect of the invention the marker sequence is a hexa histidine peptide such as the tag provided in a pQE vector Qiagen Inc. among others many of which are commercially available. As described in Gentz et al. 86 821 824 1989 for instance hexa histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. The HA tag is another peptide useful for purification which corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein which has been described by Wilson et al. 37 767 778 1984 . As discussed below other such fusion proteins include the TR17 receptor fused to Fc at the N or C terminus.

The present invention further relates to variants of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention which encode portions analogs or derivatives of the TR17 receptor. Variants may occur naturally such as a natural allelic variant. By an allelic variant is intended one of several alternate forms of a gene occupying a given locus on a chromosome of an organism. Lewin B. ed. John Wiley Sons New York 1985 . Non naturally occurring variants may be produced using art known mutagenesis techniques.

Such variants include those produced by nucleotide substitutions deletions or additions which may involve one or more nucleotides. The variants may be altered in coding or non coding regions or both. Alterations in the coding regions may produce conservative or non conservative amino acid substitutions deletions or additions. Especially preferred among these are silent substitutions additions and deletions which do not alter the properties and activities of the TR17 receptor or portions thereof. Also especially preferred in this regard are conservative substitutions.

Further embodiments of the invention include isolated nucleic acid molecules comprising or alternatively consisting of a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least 90 identical and more preferably at least 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to a a nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 2 b a nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide having the amino acid sequence in SEQ ID NO 2 but lacking the amino terminal methionine c a nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide having the amino acid sequence at positions about 1 to about 293 in SEQ ID NO 2 d a nucleotide sequence encoding the TR17 extracellular domain e a nucleotide sequence encoding the TR17 cysteine rich domain and or a nucleotide sequence encoding one or both TR17 cysteine rich motifs i.e. amino acid residues 33 to 66 and or 70 to 104 in SEQ ID NO 2 f a nucleotide sequence encoding the TR17 transmembrane domain g a nucleotide sequence encoding the TR17 receptor intracellular domain h a nucleotide sequence encoding the TR17 receptor extracellular and intracellular domains with all or part of the transmembrane domain deleted and i a nucleotide sequence complementary to any of the nucleotide sequences in a b c d e f g or h above. Polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides are also encompassed by the invention.

By a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least for example 95 identical to a reference nucleotide sequence encoding a TR17 polypeptide is intended that the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotide is identical to the reference sequence except that the polynucleotide sequence may include up to five mismatches per each 100 nucleotides of the reference nucleotide sequence encoding the TR17 polypeptide. In other words to obtain a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least 95 identical to a reference nucleotide sequence up to 5 of the nucleotides in the reference sequence may be deleted or substituted with another nucleotide or a number of nucleotides up to 5 of the total nucleotides in the reference sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence. These mismatches of the reference sequence may occur at the 5 or 3 terminal positions of the reference nucleotide sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions interspersed either individually among nucleotides in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence. The reference query sequence may be the entire TR17 encoding nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 1 or any TR17 polynucleotide fragment e.g. a polynucleotide encoding the amino acid sequence of any of the TR17 N and or C terminal deletions described herein variant derivative or analog as described herein.

As a practical matter whether any particular nucleic acid molecule is at least 90 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to for instance the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 1 can be determined conventionally using known computer programs such as the Bestfit program Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package Version 8 for Unix Genetics Computer Group University Research Park 575 Science Drive Madison Wis. 53711 . Bestfit uses the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman 2 482 489 1981 to find the best segment of homology between two sequences. When using Bestfit or any other sequence alignment program to determine whether a particular sequence is for instance 95 identical to a reference sequence according to the present invention the parameters are set of course such that the percentage of identity is calculated over the full length of the reference nucleotide sequence and that gaps in homology of up to 5 of the total number of nucleotides in the reference sequence are allowed.

In a specific embodiment the identity between a reference query sequence a sequence of the present invention and a subject sequence also referred to as a global sequence alignment is determined using the FASTDB computer program based on the algorithm of Brutlag et al. Comp. App. Biosci. 6 237 245 1990 . Preferred parameters used in a FASTDB alignment of DNA sequences to calculate percent identity are Matrix Unitary k tuple 4 Mismatch Penalty 1 Joining Penalty 30 Randomization Group Length 0 Cutoff Score 1 Gap Penalty 5 Gap Size Penalty 0.05 Window Size 500 or the length of the subject nucleotide sequence whichever is shorter. According to this embodiment if the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence because of 5 or 3 deletions not because of internal deletions a manual correction is made to the results to take into consideration the fact that the FASTDB program does not account for 5 and 3 truncations of the subject sequence when calculating percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the 5 or 3 ends relative to the query sequence the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of bases of the query sequence that are 5 and 3 of the subject sequence which are not matched aligned as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. A determination of whether a nucleotide is matched aligned is determined by results of the FASTDB sequence alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity calculated by the above FASTDB program using the specified parameters to arrive at a final percent identity score. This corrected score is what is used for the purposes of this embodiment. Only bases outside the 5 and 3 bases of the subject sequence as displayed by the FASTDB alignment which are not matched aligned with the query sequence are calculated for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score. For example a 90 base subject sequence is aligned to a 100 base query sequence to determine percent identity. The deletions occur at the 5 end of the subject sequence and therefore the FASTDB alignment does not show a matched alignment of the first 10 bases at 5 end. The 10 unpaired bases represent 10 of the sequence number of bases at the 5 and 3 ends not matched total number of bases in the query sequence so 10 is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the FASTDB program. If the remaining 90 bases were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90 . In another example a 90 base subject sequence is compared with a 100 base query sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so that there are no bases on the 5 or 3 of the subject sequence which are not matched aligned with the query. In this case the percent identity calculated by FASTDB is not manually corrected. Once again only bases 5 and 3 of the subject sequence which are not matched aligned with the query sequence are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are made for the purposes of this embodiment.

The present application is directed to nucleic acid molecules comprising or alternatively consisting of a nucleotide sequence at least 90 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to the nucleic acid sequence for example shown in SEQ ID NO 1 irrespective of whether they encode a polypeptide having TR17 receptor activity. This is because even where a particular nucleic acid molecule does not encode a polypeptide having TR17 functional activity one of skill in the art would still know how to use the nucleic acid molecule for instance as a hybridization probe or a polymerase chain reaction PCR primer. Uses of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention that do not encode a polypeptide having TR17 receptor activity include inter alia 1 isolating the TR17 gene or allelic variants thereof in a cDNA library 2 in situ hybridization e.g. FISH to metaphase chromosomal spreads to provide precise chromosomal location of the TR17 receptor gene as described in Verma et al. Pergamon Press New York 1988 and 3 Northern Blot analysis for detecting TR17 receptor mRNA expression in specific tissues.

Preferred however are nucleic acid molecules comprising or alternatively consisting of a nucleotide sequence at least 90 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to for example the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 1 which do in fact encode a polypeptide having TR17 functional activity. By a polypeptide having TR17 functional activity is intended polypeptides exhibiting activity similar but not necessarily identical to an activity of the TR17 receptor of the invention either the full length protein or preferably the mature protein as measured in a particular biological assay.

Of course due to the degeneracy of the genetic code one of ordinary skill in the art will immediately recognize that a large number of the nucleic acid molecules having a sequence at least 90 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to for example the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 1 will encode a polypeptide having TR17 functional activity. Similarly a large number of the nucleic acid molecules having a sequence at least 90 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to for example a nucleic acid sequence shown in will encode a polypeptide having TR17 functional activity. In fact since degenerate variants of these nucleotide sequences all encode the same polypeptide this will be clear to the skilled artisan even without performing a biological assay. It will be further recognized in the art that for such nucleic acid molecules that are not degenerate variants a reasonable number will also encode a polypeptide having TR17 functional activity. This is because the skilled artisan is fully aware of amino acid substitutions that are either less likely or not likely to significantly effect protein function e.g. replacing one aliphatic amino acid with a second aliphatic amino acid .

For example guidance concerning how to make phenotypically silent amino acid substitutions is provided in J. U. Bowie et al Deciphering the Message in Protein Sequences Tolerance to Amino Acid Substitutions 247 1306 1310 1990 wherein the authors indicate that proteins are surprisingly tolerant of amino acid substitutions.

This invention is also related to the use of TR17 polynucleotides to detect complementary polynucleotides such as for example as a diagnostic reagent. Detection of a normal and mutated form of TR17 associated with a dysfunction will provide a diagnostic tool that can add or define a diagnosis of a disease or susceptibility to a disease which results from under expression over expression or altered expression of TR17 or a soluble form thereof such as for example tumors or autoimmune disease.

Individuals carrying mutations in the TR17 gene may be detected at the DNA level by a variety of techniques. Nucleic acids for diagnosis may be obtained from a biological sample from a patient e.g. a patient s cells such as from blood urine saliva tissue biopsy and autopsy material . The genomic DNA may be used directly for detection or may be amplified enzymatically by using PCR prior to analysis. Saiki et al. 324 163 166 1986 . RNA or cDNA may also be used in the same ways. As an example PCR primers complementary to the nucleic acid encoding TR17 can be used to identify and analyze TR17 expression and mutations. For example deletions and insertions can be detected by a change in size of the amplified product in comparison to the normal genotype. Point mutations can be identified by hybridizing amplified DNA to radiolabeled TR17 RNA or alternatively radiolabeled TR17 antisense DNA sequences. Perfectly matched sequences can routinely be distinguished from mismatched duplexes by techniques known in the art such as for example RNase A digestion or by differences in melting temperatures.

Sequence differences between a reference gene and genes having mutations also may be revealed by direct DNA sequencing. In addition cloned DNA segments may be employed as probes to detect specific DNA segments. The sensitivity of such methods can be greatly enhanced by appropriate use of PCR or another amplification method. For example a sequencing primer is used with double stranded PCR product or a single stranded template molecule generated by a modified PCR. The sequence determination is performed by conventional procedures with radiolabeled nucleotide or by automatic sequencing procedures with fluorescent tags.

Genetic testing based on DNA sequence differences may be achieved by detection of alteration in electrophoretic mobility of DNA fragments in gels with or without denaturing agents. Small sequence deletions and insertions can be visualized by high resolution gel electrophoresis using techniques known in the art. DNA fragments of different sequences may be distinguished on denaturing formamide gradient gels in which the mobilities of different DNA fragments are retarded in the gel at different positions according to their specific melting or partial melting temperatures see e.g. Myers et al. 230 1242 1985 .

Sequence changes at specific locations also may be revealed by nuclease protection assays such as RNase and S1 protection or the chemical cleavage method e.g. Cotton et al. 85 4397 4401 1985 .

Thus the detection of a specific DNA sequence may be achieved by methods which include but are not limited to hybridization RNase protection chemical cleavage direct DNA sequencing or the use of restriction enzymes e.g. restriction fragment length polymorphisms RFLP and Southern blotting of genomic DNA.

In addition to more conventional gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing mutations also can be detected by in situ analysis.

The present invention also relates to vectors which include the isolated DNA molecules of the present invention host cells which are genetically engineered with the recombinant vectors and or nucleic acids of the invention and the production of TR17 polypeptides or fragments thereof by recombinant techniques.

Host cells can be genetically engineered to incorporate nucleic acid molecules and express polypeptides of the present invention. The polynucleotides may be introduced alone or with other polynucleotides. Such other polynucleotides may be introduced independently co introduced or introduced joined to the polynucleotides of the invention.

In accordance with the present invention the vector may be for example a plasmid vector a single or double stranded phage vector a single or double stranded RNA or DNA viral vector. Such vectors may be introduced into cells as polynucleotides preferably DNA by well known techniques for introducing DNA and RNA into cells. Viral vectors may be replication competent or replication defective. In the latter case viral propagation generally will occur only in complementing host cells.

Preferred among vectors in certain respects are those for expression of polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention. Generally such vectors comprise cis acting control regions effective for expression in a host operatively linked to the polynucleotide to be expressed. Appropriate trans acting factors either are supplied by the host supplied by a complementing vector or supplied by the vector itself upon introduction into the host.

The polynucleotides may be joined to a vector containing a selectable marker for propagation in a host. Generally a plasmid vector is introduced in a precipitate such as a calcium phosphate precipitate or in a complex with a charged lipid. If the vector is a virus it may be packaged in vitro using an appropriate packaging cell line and then transduced into host cells.

The DNA insert should be operatively linked to an appropriate promoter such as the phage lambda PL promoter the lac trp and tac promoters the SV40 early and late promoters and promoters of retroviral LTRs to name a few. Other suitable promoters will be known to the skilled artisan. The expression constructs will further contain sites for transcription initiation termination and in the transcribed region a ribosome binding site for translation. The coding portion of the mature transcripts expressed by the constructs will preferably include a translation initiating at the beginning and a termination codon UAA UGA or UAG appropriately positioned at the end of the polypeptide to be translated.

As indicated the expression vectors will preferably include at least one selectable marker. Such markers include dihydrofolate reductase neomycin resistance or glutamine synthase for eukaryotic cell culture and tetracycline or ampicillin resistance genes for culturing in and other bacteria. Representative examples of appropriate hosts include but are not limited to bacterial cells such as and cells fungal cells such as yeast cells insect cells such as S2 and Sf9 cells animal cells such as CHO NSO COS 293 and Bowes melanoma cells and plant cells. Appropriate culture mediums and conditions for the above described host cells are known in the art.

Vectors which use glutamine synthase GS or DHFR as the selectable markers can be amplified in the presence of the drugs methionine sulphoximine or methotrexate respectively. The availability of drugs which inhibit the function of the enzymes encoded by these selectable markers allows for selection of cell lines in which the vector sequences have been amplified after integration into the host cell s DNA. An advantage of glutamine synthase based vectors are the availability of cell lines e.g. the murine myeloma cell line NSO which are glutamine synthase negative. Glutamine synthase expression systems can also function in glutamine synthase expressing cells e.g. Chinese Hamster Ovary CHO cells by providing additional inhibitor to prevent the functioning of the endogenous gene. Vectors that use glutamine synthase as the selectable marker include the pEE6 expression vector described in Stephens and Cockett 17 7110 1989 . A glutamine synthase expression system and components thereof are detailed in PCT publications WO87 04462 WO86 05807 WO89 01036 WO89 10404 and WO91 06657 which are hereby incorporated in their entireties by reference herein. Additionally glutamine synthase expression vectors that may be used according to the present invention are commercially available from suppliers including for example Lonza Biologics Inc. Portsmouth N.H. . Expression and production of monoclonal antibodies using a GS expression system in murine myeloma cells is described in Bebbington et al 10 169 1992 and in Biblia and Robinson 11 1 1995 which are herein incorporated by reference.

Among vectors preferred for use in bacteria include pQE70 pQE60 and pQE 9 available from Qiagen pBS vectors Phagescript vectors Bluescript vectors pNH8A pNH16a pNH18A pNH46A available from STRATAGENE and ptrc99a pKK223 3 pKK233 3 pDR540 pRIT5 available from PHARMACIA . Among preferred eukaryotic vectors are pWLNEO pSV2CAT pOG44 pXT1 and pSG available from STRATAGENE and pSVK3 pBPV pMSG and pSVL available from PHARMACIA . Other suitable vectors will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan.

The present invention also relates to host cells containing the above described vector constructs described herein and additionally encompasses host cells containing nucleotide sequences of the invention that are operably associated with one or more heterologous control regions e.g. promoter and or enhancer using techniques known of in the art. The host cell can be a higher eukaryotic cell such as a mammalian cell e.g. a human derived cell or a lower eukaryotic cell such as a yeast cell or the host cell can be a prokaryotic cell such as a bacterial cell. The host strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted gene sequences or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Expression from certain promoters can be elevated in the presence of certain inducers thus expression of the genetically engineered polypeptide may be controlled. Furthermore different host cells have characteristics and specific mechanisms for the translational and post translational processing and modification e.g. phosphorylation cleavage of proteins. Appropriate cell lines can be chosen to ensure the desired modifications and processing of the foreign protein expressed.

Introduction of the construct into the host cell can be effected by calcium phosphate transfection DEAE dextran mediated transfection cationic lipid mediated transfection electroporation transduction infection or other methods. Such methods are described in many standard laboratory manuals such as Davis et al. 1986 .

In addition to encompassing host cells containing the vector constructs discussed herein the invention also encompasses primary secondary and immortalized host cells of vertebrate origin particularly mammalian origin that have been engineered to delete or replace endogenous genetic material e.g. TR17 coding sequence and or to include genetic material e.g. heterologous polynucleotide sequences that is operably associated with TR17 polynucleotides of the invention and which activates alters and or amplifies endogenous TR17 polynucleotides. For example techniques known in the art may be used to operably associate heterologous control regions e.g. promoter and or enhancer and endogenous TR17 polynucleotide sequences via homologous recombination see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 670 issued Jun. 24 1997 International Publication Number WO 96 29411 International Publication Number WO 94 12650 Koller et al. 86 8932 8935 1989 and Zijlstra et al. 342 435 438 1989 the disclosures of each of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties .

The TR17 polypeptide may be expressed in a modified form such as a fusion protein comprising the polypeptide joined via a peptide bond to a heterologous protein sequence of a different protein and may include not only secretion signals but also additional heterologous functional regions. Alternatively such a fusion protein can be made by protein synthetic techniques e.g. by use of a peptide synthesizer. Thus a region of additional amino acids particularly charged amino acids may be added to the N terminus of the polypeptide to improve stability and persistence in the host cell during purification or during subsequent handling and storage. Also peptide moieties may be added to the polypeptide to facilitate purification. Such regions may be removed prior to final preparation of the polypeptide. The addition of peptide moieties to polypeptides to engender secretion or excretion to improve stability and to facilitate purification among others are familiar and routine techniques in the art.

In one embodiment polynucleotides TR17 polypeptides of the invention may be fused to signal sequences which will direct the localization of a protein of the invention to particular compartments of a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell and or direct the secretion of a protein of the invention from a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell. For example in one may wish to direct the expression of the protein to the periplasmic space. Examples of signal sequences or proteins or fragments thereof to which the polypeptides of the invention may be fused in order to direct the expression of the polypeptide to the periplasmic space of bacteria include but are not limited to the pelB signal sequence the maltose binding protein MBP signal sequence MBP the ompA signal sequence the signal sequence of the periplasmic heat labile enterotoxin B subunit and the signal sequence of alkaline phosphatase. Several vectors are commercially available for the construction of fusion proteins which will direct the localization of a protein such as the pMAL series of vectors particularly the pMAL p series available from New England Biolabs. In a specific embodiment polynucleotides encoding Neutrokine alpha and or Neutrokine alphaSV polypeptides of the invention may be fused to the pelB pectate lyase signal sequence to increase the efficiency of expression and purification of such polypeptides in Gram negative bacteria. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 576 195 and 5 846 818 the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.

Examples of signal peptides that may be fused to a polypeptide of the invention in order to direct its secretion in mammalian cells include but are not limited to the MPIF 1 signal sequence amino acids 1 21 of GenBank Accession number AAB51134 the stanniocalcin signal sequence MLQNSAVLLLLVISASA SEQ ID NO 6 and a consensus signal sequence MPTWAWWLFLVLLLALWAPARG SEQ ID NO 7 . A suitable signal sequence that may be used in conjunction with baculoviral expression systems is the gp67 signal sequence amino acids 1 19 of GenBank Accession Number AAA72759 .

A preferred fusion protein comprises a heterologous region from immunoglobulin that is useful to solubilize proteins. For example EP A O 464 533 Canadian counterpart 2045869 discloses fusion proteins comprising various portions of constant region of immunoglobin molecules together with another human protein or part thereof. In many cases the Fc part in a fusion protein is thoroughly advantageous for use in therapy and diagnosis and thus results for example in improved pharmacokinetic properties EP A 0232 262 . On the other hand for some uses it would be desirable to be able to delete the Fc part after the fusion protein has been expressed detected and purified in the advantageous manner described. This is the case when the Fc portion proves to be a hindrance to use in therapy and diagnosis for example when the fusion protein is to be used as an antigen for immunizations. In drug discovery for example human proteins such as the hIL5 receptor have been fused with Fc portions for the purpose of high throughput screening assays to identify antagonists of hIL 5. See D. Bennett et al. 8 52 58 1995 and K. Johanson et al. 270 16 9459 9471 1995 .

Polypeptides of the present invention include naturally purified products products of chemical synthetic procedures and products produced by recombinant techniques from a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host including for example bacterial yeast higher plant insect and mammalian cells. Depending upon the host employed in a recombinant production procedure the polypeptides of the present invention may be glycosylated or non glycosylated. In addition polypeptides of the invention may also include an initial modified methionine residue in some cases as a result of host mediated processes.

In addition proteins of the invention can be chemically synthesized using techniques known in the art e.g. see Creighton Proteins Structures and Molecular Principles W.H. Freeman Co. N.Y. 1983 and Hunkapiller et al 310 105 111 1984 . For example a polypeptide corresponding to a fragment of the TR17 polypeptides of the invention can be synthesized by use of a peptide synthesizer. Furthermore if desired nonclassical amino acids or chemical amino acid analogs can be introduced as a substitution or addition into the TR17 polypeptide sequence. Non classical amino acids include but are not limited to to the D isomers of the common amino acids 2 4 diaminobutyric acid a amino isobutyric acid 4 aminobutyric acid Abu 2 amino butyric acid g Abu e Ahx 6 amino hexanoic acid Aib 2 amino isobutyric acid 3 amino propionic acid ornithine norleucine norvaline hydroxyproline sarcosine citrulline homocitrulline cysteic acid t butylglycine t butylalanine phenylglycine cyclohexylalanine b alanine fluoro amino acids designer amino acids such as b methyl amino acids Ca methyl amino acids Na methyl amino acids and amino acid analogs in general. Furthermore the amino acid can be D dextrorotary or L levorotary .

The invention additionally encompasses TR17 polypeptides which are differentially modified during or after translation e.g. by glycosylation acetylation phosphorylation amidation derivatization by known protecting blocking groups proteolytic cleavage linkage to an antibody molecule or other cellular ligand etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications may be carried out by known techniques including but not limited to specific chemical cleavage by cyanogen bromide trypsin chymotrypsin papain V8 protease NaBH acetylation formylation oxidation reduction metabolic synthesis in the presence of tunicamycin etc.

Additional post translational modifications encompassed by the invention include for example e.g. N linked or O linked carbohydrate chains processing of N terminal or C terminal ends attachment of chemical moieties to the amino acid backbone chemical modifications of N linked or O linked carbohydrate chains and addition or deletion of an N terminal methionine residue as a result of procaryotic host cell expression. The polypeptides may also be modified with a detectable label such as an enzymatic fluorescent isotopic or affinity label to allow for detection and isolation of the protein.

In specific embodiments TR17 polypetides of the invention are attached to macrocyclic chelators useful for conjugating radiometal ions including but not limited to In Lu Y Ho and Sm to polypeptides. In a preferred embodiment the radiometal ion associated with the macrocyclic chelators attached to TR17 polypeptides of the invention is In. In another preferred embodiment the radiometal ion associated with the macrocyclic chelator attached to TR17 polypeptides of the invention is Y. In specific embodiments the macrocyclic chelator is 1 4 7 10 tetraazacyclododecane N N N N tetraacetic acid DOTA . In other specific embodiments the DOTA is attached to TR17 polypeptide of the invention via a linker molecule. Examples of linker molecules useful for conjugating DOTA to a polypeptide are commonly known in the art see for example DeNardo et al. Clin Cancer P Res. 4 10 2483 90 1998 Peterson et al. Bioconjug. Chem. 10 4 553 7 1999 and Zimmerman et al Nucl. Med. Biol. 26 8 943 50 1999 which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. In addition U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 652 361 and 5 756 065 which disclose chelating agents that may be conjugated to antibodies and methods for making and using them are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. Though U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 652 361 and 5 756 065 focus on conjugating chelating agents to antibodies one skilled in the art could readily adapt the method disclosed therein in order to conjugate chelating agents to other polypeptides.

Also provided by the invention are chemically modified derivatives of TR17 which may provide additional advantages such as increased solubility stability and circulating time of the polypeptide or decreased immunogenicity see U.S. Pat. No. 4 179 337 . The chemical moieties for derivitization may be selected from water soluble polymers such as polyethylene glycol ethylene glycol propylene glycol copolymers carboxymethylcellulose dextran polyvinyl alcohol and the like. The polypeptides may be modified at random positions within the molecule or at predetermined positions within the molecule and may include one two three or more attached chemical moieties.

The polymer may be of any molecular weight and may be branched or unbranched. For polyethylene glycol the preferred molecular weight is between about 1 kDa and about 100 kDa the term about indicating that in preparations of polyethylene glycol some molecules will weigh more some less than the stated molecular weight for ease in handling and manufacturing. Other sizes may be used depending on the desired therapeutic profile e.g. the duration of sustained release desired the effects if any on biological activity the ease in handling the degree or lack of antigenicity and other known effects of the polyethylene glycol to a therapeutic protein or analog . For example the polyethylene glycol may have an average molecular weight of about 200 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000 5500 6000 6500 7000 7500 8000 8500 9000 9500 10 000 10 500 11 000 11 500 12 000 12 500 13 000 13 500 14 000 14 500 15 000 15 500 16 000 16 500 17 000 17 500 18 000 18 500 19 000 19 500 20 000 25 000 30 000 35 000 40 000 50 000 55 000 60 000 65 000 70 000 75 000 80 000 85 000 90 000 95 000 or 100 000 kDa.

As noted above the polyethylene glycol may have a branched structure. Branched polyethylene glycols are described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 643 575 Morpurgo et al. 56 59 72 1996 Vorobjev et al. 18 2745 2750 1999 and Caliceti et al. 10 638 646 1999 the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The polyethylene glycol molecules or other chemical moieties should be attached to the protein with consideration of effects on functional or antigenic domains of the protein. There are a number of attachment methods available to those skilled in the art e.g. EP 0 401 384 herein incorporated by reference coupling PEG to G CSF see also Malik et al. 20 1028 1035 1992 reporting pegylation of GM CSF using tresyl chloride . For example polyethylene glycol may be covalently bound through amino acid residues via a reactive group such as a free amino or carboxyl group. Reactive groups are those to which an activated polyethylene glycol molecule may be bound. The amino acid residues having a free amino group may include lysine residues and the N terminal amino acid residues those having a free carboxyl group may include aspartic acid residues glutamic acid residues and the C terminal amino acid residue. Sulfhydryl groups may also be used as a reactive group for attaching the polyethylene glycol molecules. Preferred for therapeutic purposes is attachment at an amino group such as attachment at the N terminus or lysine group.

As suggested above polyethylene glycol may be attached to proteins via linkage to any of a number of amino acid residues. For example polyethylene glycol can be linked to a proteins via covalent bonds to lysine histidine aspartic acid glutamic acid or cysteine residues. One or more reaction chemistries may be employed to attach polyethylene glycol to specific amino acid residues e.g. lysine histidine aspartic acid glutamic acid or cysteine of the protein or to more than one type of amino acid residue e.g. lysine histidine aspartic acid glutamic acid cysteine and combinations thereof of the protein.

One may specifically desire proteins chemically modified at the N terminus. Using polyethylene glycol as an illustration of the present composition one may select from a variety of polyethylene glycol molecules by molecular weight branching etc. the proportion of polyethylene glycol molecules to protein or peptide molecules in the reaction mix the type of pegylation reaction to be performed and the method of obtaining the selected N terminally pegylated protein. The method of obtaining the N terminally pegylated preparation i.e. separating this moiety from other monopegylated moieties if necessary may be by purification of the N terminally pegylated material from a population of pegylated protein molecules. Selective proteins chemically modified at the N terminus modification may be accomplished by reductive alkylation which exploits differential reactivity of different types of primary amino groups lysine versus the N terminal available for derivatization in a particular protein. Under the appropriate reaction conditions substantially selective derivatization of the protein at the N terminus with a carbonyl group containing polymer is achieved.

As indicated above pegylation of the proteins of the invention may be accomplished by any number of means. For example polyethylene glycol may be attached to the protein either directly or by an intervening linker. Linkerless systems for attaching polyethylene glycol to proteins are described in Delgado et al. 9 249 304 1992 Francis et al. 68 1 18 1998 U.S. Pat. No. 4 002 531 U.S. Pat. No. 5 349 052 WO 95 06058 and WO 98 32466 the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.

One system for attaching polyethylene glycol directly to amino acid residues of proteins without an intervening linker employs tresylated MPEG which is produced by the modification of monmethoxy polyethylene glycol MPEG using tresylchloride ClSOCHCF . Upon reaction of protein with tresylated MPEG polyethylene glycol is directly attached to amine groups of the protein. Thus the invention includes protein polyethylene glycol conjugates produced by reacting proteins of the invention with a polyethylene glycol molecule having a 2 2 2 trifluoreothane sulphonyl group.

Polyethylene glycol can also be attached to proteins using a number of different intervening linkers. For example U.S. Pat. No. 5 612 460 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference discloses urethane linkers for connecting polyethylene glycol to proteins. Protein polyethylene glycol conjugates wherein the polyethylene glycol is attached to the protein by a linker can also be produced by reaction of proteins with compounds such as MPEG succinimidylsuccinate MPEG activated with 1 1 carbonyldiimidazole MPEG 2 4 5 trichloropenylcarbonate MPEG p nitrophenolcarbonate and various MPEG succinate derivatives. A number additional polyethylene glycol derivatives and reaction chemistries for attaching polyethylene glycol to proteins are described in WO 98 32466 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Pegylated protein products produced using the reaction chemistries set out herein are included within the scope of the invention.

The number of polyethylene glycol moieties attached to each protein of the invention i.e. the degree of substitution may also vary. For example the pegylated proteins of the invention may be linked on average to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 15 17 20 or more polyethylene glycol molecules. Similarly the average degree of substitution within ranges such as 1 3 2 4 3 5 4 6 5 7 6 8 7 9 8 10 9 11 10 12 11 13 12 14 13 15 14 16 15 17 16 18 17 19 or 18 20 polyethylene glycol moieties per protein molecule. Methods for determining the degree of substitution are discussed for example in Delgado et al. 9 249 304 1992 .

As mentioned the TR17 proteins of the invention may be modified by either natural processes such as posttranslational processing or by chemical modification techniques which are well known in the art. It will be appreciated that the same type of modification may be present in the same or varying degrees at several sites in a given TR17 polypeptide. TR17 polypeptides may be branched for example as a result of ubiquitination and they may be cyclic with or without branching. Cyclic branched and branched cyclic TR17 polypeptides may result from posttranslation natural processes or may be made by synthetic methods. Modifications include acetylation acylation ADP ribosylation amidation covalent attachment of flavin covalent attachment of a heme moiety covalent attachment of a nucleotide or nucleotide derivative covalent attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative covalent attachment of phosphotidylinositol cross linking cyclization disulfide bond formation demethylation formation of covalent cross links formation of cysteine formation of pyroglutamate formylation gamma carboxylation glycosylation GPI anchor formation hydroxylation iodination methylation myristoylation oxidation pegylation proteolytic processing phosphorylation prenylation racemization selenoylation sulfation transfer RNA mediated addition of amino acids to proteins such as arginylation and ubiquitination.

The TR17 polypeptides of the invention can be recovered and purified from chemical synthesis and recombinant cell cultures by standard methods which include but are not limited to ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation acid extraction anion or cation exchange chromatography phosphocellulose chromatography hydrophobic interaction chromatography affinity chromatography hydroxylapatite chromatography and lectin chromatography. Most preferably high performance liquid chromatography HPLC is employed for purification. Well known techniques for refolding protein may be employed to regenerate active conformation when the polypeptide is denatured during isolation and or purification.

TR17 receptor polynucleotides and polypeptides may be used in accordance with the present invention for a variety of applications particularly those that make use of the chemical and biological properties of TR17. Among these are applications in treatment of tumors resistance to parasites bacteria and viruses to inhibit proliferation of B cells to induce proliferation of T cells endothelial cells and certain hematopoietic cells to treat restenosis graft vs. host disease to regulate anti viral responses and to prevent certain autoimmune diseases after stimulation of TR17 by an agonist. Additional applications relate to diagnosis and to treatment of disorders of cells tissues and organisms. These aspects of the invention are discussed further below.

The TR17 proteins of the invention can also be expressed in transgenic animals. Animals of any species including but not limited to mice rats rabbits hamsters guinea pigs pigs micro pigs goats sheep cows and non human primates e.g. baboons monkeys and chimpanzees may be used to generate transgenic animals. In a specific embodiment techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art are used to express polypeptides of the invention in humans as part of a gene therapy protocol.

Any technique known in the art may be used to introduce the transgene i.e. nucleic acids of the invention into animals to produce the founder lines of transgenic animals. Such techniques include but are not limited to pronuclear microinjection Paterson et al. 40 691 698 1994 Carver et al 11 1263 1270 1993 Wright et al. 9 830 834 1991 and Hoppe et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 873 191 1989 retrovirus mediated gene transfer into germ lines Van der Putten et al. 82 6148 6152 1985 blastocysts or embryos gene targeting in embryonic stem cells Thompson et al. 56 313 321 1989 electroporation of cells or embryos Lo 3 1803 1814 1983 introduction of the polynucleotides of the invention using a gene gun see e.g. Ulmer et al. 259 1745 1993 introducing nucleic acid constructs into embryonic pleuripotent stem cells and transferring the stem cells back into the blastocyst and sperm mediated gene transfer Lavitrano et al. 57 717 723 1989 etc. For a review of such techniques see Gordon Transgenic Animals 115 171 229 1989 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

Any technique known in the art may be used to produce transgenic clones containing polynucleotides of the invention for example nuclear transfer into enucleated oocytes of nuclei from cultured embryonic fetal or adult cells induced to quiescence Campell et al. 380 64 66 1996 Wilmut et al. 385 810 813 1997 each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety .

The present invention provides for transgenic animals that carry the transgene in all their cells as well as animals which carry the transgene in some but not all their cells i.e. mosaic animals or chimeric animals. The transgene may be integrated as a single transgene or as multiple copies such as in concatamers e.g. head to head tandems or head to tail tandems. The transgene may also be selectively introduced into and activated in a particular cell type by following for example the teaching of Lasko et al 89 6232 6236 1992 . The regulatory sequences required for such a cell type specific activation will depend upon the particular cell type of interest and will be apparent to those of skill in the art. When it is desired that the polynucleotide transgene be integrated into the chromosomal site of the endogenous gene gene targeting is preferred. Briefly when such a technique is to be utilized vectors containing some nucleotide sequences homologous to the endogenous gene are designed for the purpose of integrating via homologous recombination with chromosomal sequences into and disrupting the function of the nucleotide sequence of the endogenous gene. The transgene may also be selectively introduced into a particular cell type thus inactivating the endogenous gene in only that cell type by following for example the teaching of Gu et al. 265 103 106 1994 . The regulatory sequences required for such a cell type specific inactivation will depend upon the particular cell type of interest and will be apparent to those of skill in the art. The contents of each of the documents recited in this paragraph is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Once transgenic animals have been generated the expression of the recombinant gene may be assayed utilizing standard techniques. Initial screening may be accomplished by Southern blot analysis or PCR techniques to analyze animal tissues to verify that integration of the transgene has taken place. The level of mRNA expression of the transgene in the tissues of the transgenic animals may also be assessed using techniques which include but are not limited to Northern blot analysis of tissue samples obtained from the animal in situ hybridization analysis and reverse transcriptase PCR rt PCR . Samples of transgenic gene expressing tissue may also be evaluated immunocytochemically or immunohistochemically using antibodies specific for the transgene product.

Once the founder animals are produced they may be bred inbred outbred or crossbred to produce colonies of the particular animal. Examples of such breeding strategies include but are not limited to outbreeding of founder animals with more than one integration site in order to establish separate lines inbreeding of separate lines in order to produce compound transgenics that express the transgene at higher levels because of the effects of additive expression of each transgene crossing of heterozygous transgenic animals to produce animals homozygous for a given integration site in order to both augment expression and eliminate the need for screening of animals by DNA analysis crossing of separate homozygous lines to produce compound heterozygous or homozygous lines and breeding to place the transgene on a distinct background that is appropriate for an experimental model of interest.

Transgenic and knock out animals of the invention have uses which include but are not limited to animal model systems useful in elaborating the biological function of TR17 polypeptides studying conditions and or disorders associated with aberrant TR17 expression and in screening for compounds effective in ameliorating such conditions and or disorders.

In further embodiments of the invention cells that are genetically engineered to express the proteins of the invention or alternatively that are genetically engineered not to express the proteins of the invention e.g. knockouts are administered to a patient in vivo. Such cells may be obtained from the patient i.e. animal including human or an MHC compatible donor and can include but are not limited to fibroblasts bone marrow cells blood cells e.g. lymphocytes adipocytes muscle cells endothelial cells etc. The cells are genetically engineered in vitro using recombinant DNA techniques to introduce the coding sequence of polypeptides of the invention into the cells or alternatively to disrupt the coding sequence and or endogenous regulatory sequence associated with the polypeptides of the invention e.g. by transduction using viral vectors and preferably vectors that integrate the transgene into the cell genome or transfection procedures including but not limited to the use of plasmids cosmids YACs naked DNA electroporation liposomes etc. The coding sequence of the polypeptides of the invention can be placed under the control of a strong constitutive or inducible promoter or promoter enhancer to achieve expression and preferably secretion of the polypeptides of the invention. The engineered cells which express and preferably secrete the polypeptides of the invention can be introduced into the patient systemically e.g. in the circulation or intraperitoneally. Alternatively the cells can be incorporated into a matrix and implanted in the body e.g. genetically engineered fibroblasts can be implanted as part of a skin graft genetically engineered endothelial cells can be implanted as part of a lymphatic or vascular graft. See for example Anderson et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 399 349 and Mulligan Wilson U.S. Pat. No. 5 460 959 each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety .

When the cells to be administered are non autologous or non MHC compatible cells they can be administered using well known techniques which prevent the development of a host immune response against the introduced cells. For example the cells may be introduced in an encapsulated form which while allowing for an exchange of components with the immediate extracellular environment does not allow the introduced cells to be recognized by the host immune system.

The TR17 proteins polypeptides of the invention may be in monomers or multimers i.e. dimers trimers tetramers and higher multimers . Accordingly the present invention relates to monomers and multimers of the TR17 proteins polypeptides of the invention their preparation and compositions preferably pharmaceutical compositions containing them. In specific embodiments the polypeptides of the invention are monomers dimers trimers or tetramers. In additional embodiments the multimers of the invention are at least dimers at least trimers or at least tetramers.

Multimers encompassed by the invention may be homomers or heteromers. As used herein the term homomer refers to a multimer containing only TR17 proteins of the invention including TR17 fragments variants and fusion proteins as described herein . These homomers may contain TR17 proteins having identical or different polypeptide sequences. In a specific embodiment a homomer of the invention is a multimer containing only TR17 proteins having an identical polypeptide sequence. In another specific embodiment a homomer of the invention is a multimer containing TR17 proteins having different polypeptide sequences e.g. TR17 mutations containing proteins have polypeptide sequences. In specific embodiments the multimer of the invention is a homodimer e.g. containing TR17 proteins having identical or different polypeptide sequences or a homotrimer e.g. containing TR17 proteins having identical or different polypeptide sequences . In additional embodiments the homomeric multimer of the invention is at least a homodimer at least a homotrimer or at least a homotetramer.

As used herein the term heteromer refers to a multimer containing heterologous proteins i.e. proteins containing only polypeptide sequences that do not correspond to a polypeptide sequences encoded by the TR17 gene in addition to the TR17 proteins of the invention. In a specific embodiment the multimer of the invention is a heterodimer a heterotrimer or a heterotetramer. In additional embodiments the heteromeric multimer of the invention is at least a heterodimer at least a heterotrimer or at least a heterotetramer.

Multimers of the invention may be the result of hydrophobic hydrophilic ionic and or covalent associations and or may be indirectly linked by for example liposome formation. Thus in one embodiment multimers of the invention such as for example homodimers or homotrimers are formed when proteins of the invention contact one another in solution. In another embodiment heteromultimers of the invention such as for example heterotrimers or heterotetramers are formed when proteins of the invention contact antibodies to the polypeptides of the invention including antibodies to the heterologous polypeptide sequence in a fusion protein of the invention in solution. In other embodiments multimers of the invention are formed by covalent associations with and or between the TR17 proteins of the invention. Such covalent associations may involve one or more amino acid residues contained in the polypeptide sequence of the protein e.g. the polypeptide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 2 . In one instance the covalent associations are cross linking between cysteine residues located within the polypeptide sequences of the proteins which interact in the native i.e. naturally occurring polypeptide. In another instance the covalent associations are the consequence of chemical or recombinant manipulation. Alternatively such covalent associations may involve one or more amino acid residues contained in the heterologous polypeptide sequence in a TR17 fusion protein. In one example covalent associations are between the heterologous sequence contained in a fusion protein of the invention see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 478 925 . In a specific example the covalent associations are between the heterologous sequence contained in a TR17 Fc fusion protein of the invention as described herein . In another specific example covalent associations of fusion proteins of the invention are between heterologous polypeptide sequences from another TNF family ligand receptor member that is capable of forming covalently associated multimers such as for example oseteoprotegerin see e.g. International Publication No. WO 98 49305 the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . In another embodiment two or more TR17 polypeptides of the invention are joined through synthetic linkers e.g. peptide carbohydrate or soluble polymer linkers . Examples include those peptide linkers described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 073 627 hereby incorporated by reference . Proteins comprising multiple TR17 polypeptides separated by peptide linkers may be produced using conventional recombinant DNA technology.

Another method for preparing multimer TR17 polypeptides of the invention involves use of TR17 polypeptides fused to a leucine zipper or isoleucine polypeptide sequence. Leucine zipper domains and isoleucine zipper domains are polypeptides that promote multimerization of the proteins in which they are found. Leucine zippers were originally identified in several DNA binding proteins Landschulz et al. 240 1759 1988 and have since been found in a variety of different proteins. Among the known leucine zippers are naturally occurring peptides and derivatives thereof that dimerize or trimerize. Examples of leucine zipper domains suitable for producing soluble multimeric TR17 proteins are those described in PCT application WO 94 10308 hereby incorporated by reference. Recombinant fusion proteins comprising a soluble TR17 polypeptide fused to a peptide that dimerizes or trimerizes in solution are expressed in suitable host cells and the resulting soluble multimeric TR17 is recovered from the culture supernatant using techniques known in the art.

Certain members of the TNF family of proteins are believed to exist in trimeric form Beutler and Huffel 264 667 1994 Banner et al. 73 431 1993 . Thus trimeric TR17 may offer the advantage of enhanced biological activity. Preferred leucine zipper moieties are those that preferentially form trimers. One example is a leucine zipper derived from lung surfactant protein D SPD as described in Hoppe et al. 344 191 1994 and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08 446 922 hereby incorporated by reference. Other peptides derived from naturally occurring trimeric proteins may be employed in preparing trimeric TR17.

Flag polypeptide sequence contained in Flag TR17 fusion proteins of the invention. In a further embodiment associated proteins of the invention are associated by interactions between heterologous polypeptide sequence contained in Flag TR17 fusion proteins of the invention and anti Flag antibody.

The multimers of the invention may be generated using chemical techniques known in the art. For example proteins desired to be contained in the multimers of the invention may be chemically cross linked using linker molecules and linker molecule length optimization techniques known in the art see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 478 925 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Additionally multimers of the invention may be generated using techniques known in the art to form one or more inter molecule cross links between the cysteine residues located within the polypeptide sequence of the proteins desired to be contained in the multimer see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 478 925 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Further proteins of the invention may be routinely modified by the addition of cysteine or biotin to the C terminus or N terminus of the polypeptide sequence of the protein and techniques known in the art may be applied to generate multimers containing one or more of these modified proteins see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 478 925 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Additionally techniques known in the art may be applied to generate liposomes containing the protein components desired to be contained in the multimer of the invention see e.g. U.S. Pat.

Alternatively multimers of the invention may be generated using genetic engineering techniques known in the art. In one embodiment proteins contained in multimers of the invention are produced recombinantly using fusion protein technology described herein or otherwise known in the art see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 478 925 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . In a specific embodiment polynucleotides coding for a homodimer of the invention are generated by ligating a polynucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of the invention to a sequence encoding a linker polypeptide and then further to a synthetic polynucleotide encoding the translated product of the polypeptide in the reverse orientation from the original C terminus to the N terminus lacking the leader sequence see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 478 925 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . In another embodiment recombinant techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art are applied to generate recombinant polypeptides of the invention which contain a transmembrane domain and which can be incorporated by membrane reconstitution techniques into liposomes see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 478 925 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety .

The polypeptides of the present invention are preferably provided in an isolated form. By isolated polypeptide is intended a polypeptide removed from its native environment. Thus a polypeptide produced and or contained within a recombinant host cell is considered isolated for purposes of the present invention. Also intended as an isolated polypeptide are polypeptides that have been purified partially or substantially from a recombinant host cell. For example a recombinantly produced version of the TR17 polypeptide can be substantially purified by the one step method described in Smith and Johnson 67 31 40 1988 .

Accordingly in one embodiment the invention provides an isolated TR17 polypeptide having the amino acid sequence encoded by the amino acid sequence in SEQ ID NO 2 or a polypeptide comprising a portion of the above polypeptides such as for example a mature TR17 comprising amino acids 1 to 293 of SEQ ID NO 2 the TR17 extracellular domain comprising amino acids 1 to 165 of SEQ ID NO 2 the TR17 cysteine rich domain comprising amino acids 33 to 104 of SEQ ID NO 2 and or the TR17 intracellular domain comprising amino acids 187 to 293 of .

Polypeptide fragments of the present invention include polypeptides comprising or alternatively consisting of an amino acid sequence contained in SEQ ID NO 2 and encoded by a nucleic acid containing a polynucleotide sequence which hybridizes e.g. under stringent hybridization conditions to the nucleotide sequence encoded by a nucleic acid containing a polynucleotide sequence which hybridizes to the complementary strand of the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 1 . Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.

Protein fragments may be free standing or comprised within a larger polypeptide of which the fragment forms a part or region most preferably as a single continuous region. Representative examples of polypeptide fragments of the invention include for example fragments that comprise or alternatively consist of from about amino acid residues 1 to 32 33 to 66 33 to 69 67 to 104 70 to 104 105 to 135 136 to 165 166 to 186 187 to 207 208 to 238 239 to 269 and or 270 to 293 of SEQ ID NO 2 or . Moreover polypeptide fragments can be at least 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 175 200 250 300 350 400 or 500 amino acids in length. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention. In this context about includes the particularly recited ranges larger or smaller by several 5 4 3 2 or 1 amino acids at either extreme or at both extremes. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.

In additional embodiments the polypeptide fragments of the invention comprise or alternatively consist of one or more TR17 domains. Preferred polypeptide fragments of the present invention include a member selected from the group a a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of the TR17 extracellular domain predicted to constitute amino acid residues from about 1 to about 165 SEQ ID NO 2 b a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of a TR17 cysteine rich domain predicted to constitute amino acid residues from about 33 to about 104 SEQ ID NO 2 c a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of the TR17 transmembrane domain predicted to constitute amino acid residues from about 166 to about 186 SEQ ID NO 2 d a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of the TR17 intracellular domain predicted to constitute amino acid residues from about 187 to about 293 SEQ ID NO 2 e a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of one two three four or more epitope bearing portions of the TR17 protein or f any combination of polypeptides a e . Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.

As discussed above it is believed that the extracellular cysteine rich motifs of TR17 are important for interactions between TR17 and its ligands. Accordingly in preferred embodiments polypeptide fragments of the invention comprise or alternatively consist of amino acid residues 33 to 66 and or 70 to 104 of SEQ ID NO 2 . In a specific embodiment the polypeptides of the invention comprise or alternatively consist of one or both of the extracellular cysteine rich motifs disclosed in . Proteins comprising or alternatively consisting of a polypeptide sequence which is at least 80 90 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to the polypeptide sequences of one or both of these cysteine rich motifs are also encompassed by the invention. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.

Among the especially preferred fragments of the invention are fragments characterized by structural or functional attributes of TR17. Such fragments include amino acid residues that comprise alpha helix and alpha helix forming regions alpha regions beta sheet and beta sheet forming regions beta regions turn and turn forming regions turn regions coil and coil forming regions coil regions hydrophilic regions hydrophobic regions alpha amphipathic regions beta amphipathic regions surface forming regions and high antigenic index regions i.e. containing four or more contiguous amino acids having an antigenic index of greater than or equal to 1.5 as identified using the default parameters of the Jameson Wolf program of complete i.e. full length TR17 SEQ ID NO 2 . Certain preferred regions are those set out in and include but are not limited to regions of the aforementioned types identified by analysis of the amino acid sequence depicted in SEQ ID NO 2 such preferred regions include Garnier Robson predicted alpha regions beta regions turn regions and coil regions Chou Fasman predicted alpha regions beta regions and turn regions Kyte Doolittle predicted hydrophilic Hopp Woods predicted hydrophobic regions Eisenberg alpha and beta amphipathic regions Emini surface forming regions and Jameson Wolf high antigenic index regions as predicted using the default parameters of these computer programs. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.

As mentioned above even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the N terminus of a protein results in modification of loss of one or more biological functions of the protein other functional activities e.g. biological activities ability to multimerize ability to bind TR17 ligand e.g. Neutrokine alpha and APRIL may still be retained. For example the ability of shortened TR17 muteins to induce and or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptides generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the N terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N terminal residues of a complete full length polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that an TR17 mutein with a large number of deleted N terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact peptides composed of as few as six TR17 amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.

Accordingly the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the amino terminus of the TR17 amino acid sequence shown in up to the glutamine residue at position number 288 and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular the present invention provides polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues n 293 of where nis an integer from 2 to 288 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in SEQ ID NO 2 .

Polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides are also encompassed by the invention.

In another embodiment N terminal deletions of the TR17 polypeptide can be described by the general formula n 165 where nis a number from 2 to 161 corresponding to the position of amino acid identified in SEQ ID NO 2 . Preferably N terminal deletions of the TR17 polypeptide of the invention shown as SEQ ID NO 2 include polypeptides comprising or alternatively consisting of the amino acid sequence of residues S 2 to S 165 G 3 to S 165 L 4 to S 165 G 5 to S 165 R 6 to S 165 S 7 to S 165 R 8 to S 165 R 9 to S 165 G 10 to S 165 G 11 to S 165 R 12 to S 165 S 13 to S 165 R 14 to S 165 V 15 to S 165 D 16 to S 165 Q 17 to S 165 E 18 to S 165 E 19 to S 165 R 20 to S 165 F 21 to S 165 P 22 to S 165 Q 23 to S 165 G 24 to S 165 L 25 to S 165 W 26 to S 165 T 27 to S 165 G 28 to S 165 V 29 to S 165 A 30 to S 165 M 31 to S 165 R 32 to S 165 S 33 to S 165 C 34 to S 165 P 35 to S 165 E 36 to S 165 E 37 to S 165 Q 38 to S 165 Y 39 to S 165 W 40 to S 165 D 41 to S 165 P 42 to S 165 L 43 to S 165 L 44 to S 165 G 45 to S 165 T 46 to S 165 C 47 to S 165 M 48 to S 165 S 49 to S 165 C 50 to S 165 K 51 to S 165 T 52 to S 165 1 53 to S 165 C 54 to S 165 N 55 to S 165 H 56 to S 165 Q 57 to S 165 S 58 to S 165 Q 59 to S 165 R 60 to S 165 T 61 to S 165 C 62 to S 165 A 63 to S 165 A 64 to S 165 F 65 to S 165 C 66 to S 165 R 67 to S 165 S 68 to S 165 L 69 to S 165 S 70 to S 165 C 71 to S 165 R 72 to S 165 K 73 to S 165 E 74 to S 165 Q 75 to S 165 G 76 to S 165 K 77 to S 165 F 78 to S 165 Y 79 to S 165 D 80 to S 165 H 81 to S 165 L 82 to S 165 L 83 to S 165 R 84 to S 165 D 85 to S 165 C 86 to S 165 1 87 to S 165 S 88 to S 165 C 89 to S 165 A 90 to S 165 S 91 to S 165 1 92 to S 165 C 93 to S 165 G 94 to S 165 Q 95 to S 165 H 96 to S 165 P 97 to S 165 K 98 to S 165 Q 99 to S 165 C 100 to S 165 A 101 to S 165 Y 102 to S 165 F 103 to S 165 C 104 to S 165 E 105 to S 165 N 106 to S 165 K 107 to S 165 L 108 to S 165 R 109 to S 165 S 110 to S 165 P 111 to S 165 V 112 to S 165 N 113 to S 165 L 114 to S 165 P 115 to S 165 P 116 to S 165 E 117 to S 165 L 118 to S 165 R 119 to S 165 R 120 to S 165 Q 121 to S 165 R 122 to S 165 S 123 to S 165 G 124 to S 165 E 125 to S 165 V 126 to S 165 E 127 to S 165 N 128 to S 165 N 129 to S 165 S 130 to S 165 D 131 to S 165 N 132 to S 165 S 133 to S 165 G 134 to S 165 R 135 to S 165 Y 136 to S 165 Q 137 to S 165 G 138 to S 165 L 139 to S 165 E 140 to S 165 H 141 to S 165 R 142 to S 165 G 143 to S 165 S 144 to S 165 E 145 to S 165 A 146 to S 165 S 147 to S 165 P 148 to S 165 A 149 to S 165 L 150 to S 165 P 151 to S 165 G 152 to S 165 L 153 to S 165 K 154 to S 165 L 155 to S 165 S 156 to S 165 A 157 to S 165 D 158 to S 165 Q 159 to S 165 V 160 to S 165 and or A 161 to S 165 of the TR17 extracellular domain sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 2 .

Also as mentioned above even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the C terminus of a protein results in modification of loss of one or more biological functions of the protein other functional activities e.g. biological activities ability to multimerize ability to bind TR17 ligand may still be retained . For example the ability of the shortened TR17 mutein to induce and or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the polypeptide generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the C terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking C terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a TR17 mutein with a large number of deleted C terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact peptides composed of as few as six TR17 amino acid residues may often evoke an immune response.

Accordingly the present invention further provides polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the carboxy terminus of the amino acid sequence of the TR17 polypeptide shown in up to the arginine residue at position number 6 and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular the present invention provides polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues 1 mof where mis an integer from 6 to 292 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in SEQ ID NO 2 .

More in particular the invention provides polynucleotides encoding polypeptides comprising or alternatively consisting of the amino acid sequence of residues M 1 to G 292 M 1 to P 291 M 1 to G 290 M 1 to G 289 M 1 to E 288 M 1 to Q 287 M 1 to A 286 M 1 to P 285 M 1 to V 284 M 1 to C 283 M 1 to V 282 M 1 to I 281 M 1 to G 280 M 1 to L 279 M 1 to G 278 M 1 to S 277 M 1 to D 276 M 1 to P 275 M 1 to I 274 M 1 to H 273 M 1 to P 272 M 1 to C 271 M 1 to P 270 M 1 to Q 269 M 1 to L 268 M 1 to V 267 M 1 to T 266 M 1 to T 265 M 1 to R 264 M 1 to T 263 M 1 to H 262 M 1 to C 261 M 1 to G 260 M 1 to W 259 M 1 to R 258 M 1 to G 257 M 1 to A 256 M 1 to C 255 M 1 to T 254 M 1 to P 253 M 1 to D 252 M 1 to P 251 M 1 to T 250 M 1 to G 249 M 1 to P 248 M 1 to T 247 M 1 to V 246 M 1 to A 245 M 1 to S 244 M 1 to E 243 M 1 to Q 242 M 1 to T 241 M 1 to P 240 M 1 to A 239 M 1 to R 238 M 1 to C 237 M 1 to E 236 M 1 to P 235 M 1 to F 234 M 1 to C 233 M 1 to F 232 M 1 to S 231 M 1 to C 230 M 1 to T 229 M 1 to E 228 M 1 to V 227 M 1 to P 226 M 1 to E 225 M 1 to P 224 M 1 to S 223 M 1 to T 222 M 1 to S 221 M 1 to V 220 

The invention also provides polypeptides having one or more amino acids deleted from both the amino and the carboxyl termini which may be described generally as having residues n mand or n m of i.e. SEQ ID NO 2 where n n and mare integers as described above. Thus any of the above listed N or C terminal deletions can be combined to produce a N and C terminal deleted TR17 polypeptide.

The present invention encompasses TR17 polypeptides comprising or alternatively consisting of an epitope of the polypeptide having an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 2 or an epitope of the polypeptide sequence encoded by a polynucleotide that hybridizes to the complement of the sequence of SEQ ID NO 1 under stringent hybridization conditions or lower stringency hybridization conditions as defined supra. The present invention further encompasses polynucleotide sequences encoding an epitope of a TR17 polypeptide sequence of the invention such as for example the sequence disclosed in SEQ ID NO 2 polynucleotide sequences of the complementary strand of a polynucleotide sequence encoding an epitope of the invention and polynucleotide sequences which hybridize to the complementary strand under stringent hybridization conditions or lower stringency hybridization conditions defined supra.

The term epitopes as used herein refers to portions of a polypeptide having antigenic or immunogenic activity in an animal preferably a mammal and most preferably in a human. In a preferred embodiment the present invention encompasses a polypeptide comprising an epitope as well as the polynucleotide encoding this polypeptide. An immunogenic epitope as used herein is defined as a portion of a protein that elicits an antibody response in an animal as determined by any method known in the art for example by the methods for generating antibodies described infra. See for example Geysen et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81 3998 4002 1983 . The term antigenic epitope as used herein is defined as a portion of a protein to which an antibody can immunospecifically bind its antigen as determined by any method well known in the art for example by the immunoassays described herein. Immunospecific binding excludes non specific binding but does not necessarily exclude cross reactivity with other antigens. Antigenic epitopes need not necessarily be immunogenic.

Fragments which function as epitopes may be produced by any conventional means. See e.g. Houghten Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82 5131 5135 1985 further described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 631 211 .

In the present invention antigenic epitopes preferably contain a sequence of at least 4 at least 5 at least 6 at least 7 more preferably at least 8 at least 9 at least 10 at least 11 at least 12 at least 13 at least 14 at least 15 at least 20 at least 25 at least 30 at least 40 at least 50 and most preferably between about 15 to about 30 amino acids. Preferred polypeptides comprising immunogenic or antigenic epitopes are at least 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 or 100 amino acid residues in length.

Non limiting examples of antigenic polypeptides or peptides that can be used to generate TR17 specific antibodies include a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues from about Gly 5 to about Gly 11 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues from about Ser 33 to about Glu 36 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues from about Gln 57 to about Arg 60 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues from about Arg 72 to about Phe 78 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues from about Glu 105 to about Ser 110 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues from about Pro 115 to about Gly 134 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues from about Glu 140 to about Pro 148 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues from about Leu 186 to about Ala 216 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues from about Thr 222 to about Glu 228 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues from about Arg 238 to about Ser 244 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues from about Asp 252 to about Cys 255 in SEQ ID NO 2 and a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues from about Ala 286 to about Gly 290 in SEQ ID NO 2 . In this context about means the particularly recited ranges and ranges larger or smaller by several a few 5 4 3 2 or 1 amino acid residues at either or both the amino and carboxy termini. These polypeptide fragments have been determined to bear antigenic epitopes of the TR17 polypeptide by the analysis of the Jameson Wolf antigenic index as shown in and Table I above. Additional non exclusive preferred antigenic epitopes include the antigenic epitopes disclosed herein as well as portions thereof. Antigenic epitopes are useful for example to raise antibodies including monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind the epitope. Preferred antigenic epitopes include the antigenic epitopes disclosed herein as well as any combination of two three four five or more of these antigenic epitopes. Antigenic epitopes can be used as the target molecules in immunoassays. See for instance Wilson et al. 37 767 778 1984 Sutcliffe et al. Science 219 660 666 1983 .

Similarly immunogenic epitopes can be used for example to induce antibodies according to methods well known in the art. See for instance Sutcliffe et al. supra Wilson et al. supra Chow et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82 910 914 and Bittle et al. J. Gen. Virol. 66 2347 2354 1985 . Preferred immunogenic epitopes include the immunogenic epitopes disclosed herein as well as any combination of two three four five or more of these immunogenic epitopes. The polypeptides comprising one or more immunogenic epitopes may be presented for eliciting an antibody response together with a carrier protein such as an albumin to an animal system such as rabbit or mouse or if the polypeptide is of sufficient length at least about 25 amino acids the polypeptide may be presented without a carrier. However immunogenic epitopes comprising as few as 8 to 10 amino acids have been shown to be sufficient to raise antibodies capable of binding to at the very least linear epitopes in a denatured polypeptide e.g. in Western blotting .

Epitope bearing polypeptides of the present invention may be used to induce antibodies according to methods well known in the art including but not limited to in vivo immunization in vitro immunization and phage display methods. See e.g. Sutcliffe et al. supra Wilson et al. supra and Bittle et al. J. Gen. Virol. 66 2347 2354 1985 . If in vivo immunization is used animals may be immunized with free peptide however anti peptide antibody titer may be boosted by coupling the peptide to a macromolecular carrier such as keyhole limpet hemacyanin KLH or tetanus toxoid. For instance peptides containing cysteine residues may be coupled to a carrier using a linker such as maleimidobenzoyl N hydroxysuccinimide ester MBS while other peptides may be coupled to carriers using a more general linking agent such as glutaraldehyde. Animals such as rabbits rats and mice are immunized with either free or carrier coupled peptides for instance by intraperitoneal and or intradermal injection of emulsions containing about 100 g of peptide or carrier protein and Freund s adjuvant or any other adjuvant known for stimulating an immune response. Several booster injections may be needed for instance at intervals of about two weeks to provide a useful titer of anti peptide antibody which can be detected for example by ELISA assay using free peptide adsorbed to a solid surface. The titer of anti peptide antibodies in serum from an immunized animal may be increased by selection of anti peptide antibodies for instance by adsorption to the peptide on a solid support and elution of the selected antibodies according to methods well known in the art.

As one of skill in the art will appreciate and as discussed above the polypeptides of the present invention comprising an immunogenic or antigenic epitope can be fused to other polypeptide sequences. For example the polypeptides of the present invention may be fused with the constant domain of immunoglobulins IgA IgE IgG IgM or portions thereof CH1 CH2 CH3 or any combination thereof and portions thereof or albumin including but not limited to recombinant human albumin or fragments or variants thereof see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 876 969 issued Mar. 2 1999 EP Patent 0 413 622 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 766 883 issued Jun. 16 1998 herein incorporated by reference in their entirety resulting in chimeric polypeptides. Such fusion proteins may facilitate purification and may increase half life in vivo. This has been shown for chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4 polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins. See e.g. EP 394 827 Traunecker et al. Nature 331 84 86 1988 . Enhanced delivery of an antigen across the epithelial barrier to the immune system has been demonstrated for antigens e.g. insulin conjugated to an FcRn binding partner such as IgG or Fc fragments see e.g. PCT Publications WO 96 22024 and WO 99 04813 . IgG Fusion proteins that have a disulfide linked dimeric structure due to the IgG portion desulfide bonds have also been found to be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules than monomeric polypeptides or fragments thereof alone. See e.g. Fountoulakis et al. J. Biochem. 270 3958 3964 1995 . Nucleic acids encoding the above epitopes can also be recombined with a gene of interest as an epitope tag e.g. the hemagglutinin HA tag or flag tag to aid in detection and purification of the expressed polypeptide. For example a system described by Janknecht et al. allows for the ready purification of non denatured fusion proteins expressed in human cell lines Janknecht et al. 1991 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88 8972 897 . In this system the gene of interest is subcloned into a vaccinia recombination plasmid such that the open reading frame of the gene is translationally fused to an amino terminal tag consisting of six histidine residues. The tag serves as a matrix binding domain for the fusion protein. Extracts from cells infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus are loaded onto Ni2 nitriloacetic acid agarose column and histidine tagged proteins can be selectively eluted with imidazole containing buffers.

Additional fusion proteins of the invention may be generated through the techniques of gene shuffling motif shuffling exon shuffling and or codon shuffling collectively referred to as DNA shuffling . DNA shuffling may be employed to modulate the activities of polypeptides of the invention such methods can be used to generate polypeptides with altered activity as well as agonists and antagonists of the polypeptides. See generally U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 605 793 5 811 238 5 830 721 5 834 252 and 5 837 458 and Patten et al. Curr. Opinion Biotechnol. 8 724 33 1997 Harayama Trends Biotechnol. 16 2 76 82 1998 Hansson et al. J. Mol. Biol. 287 265 76 1999 and Lorenzo and Blasco Biotechniques 24 2 308 13 1998 each of these patents and publications are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety . In one embodiment alteration of TR17 polynucleotides corresponding to SEQ ID NO 1 and the polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides may be achieved by DNA shuffling. DNA shuffling involves the assembly of two or more DNA segments by homologous or site specific recombination to generate variation in the polynucleotide sequence. In another embodiment polynucleotides of the invention or the encoded polypeptides may be altered by being subjected to random mutagenesis by error prone PCR random nucleotide insertion or other methods prior to recombination. In another embodiment one or more components motifs sections parts domains fragments etc. of a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the invention may be recombined with one or more components motifs sections parts domains fragments etc. of one or more heterologous molecules.

It will be recognized in the art that some amino acid sequences of TR17 can be varied without significant effect on the structure or function of the protein. If such differences in sequence are contemplated it should be remembered that there will be critical areas on the protein which determine activity. Thus the invention further includes variations of the TR17 receptor which show substantial TR17 receptor activity or which include regions of TR17 proteins such as the protein portions discussed herein. Such mutants include deletions insertions inversions repeats and type substitutions. As indicated above guidance concerning which amino acid changes are likely to be phenotypically silent can be found in J. U. Bowie et al. 247 1306 1310 1990 .

Thus the fragment derivative or analog of the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO 2 may be i one in which at least one or more of the amino acid residues are substituted with a conserved or non conserved amino acid residue preferably a conserved amino acid residue s and more preferably at least one but less than ten conserved amino acid residues and such substituted amino acid residue may or may not be one encoded by the genetic code or ii one in which one or more of the amino acid residues includes a substituent group or iii one in which the mature polypeptide is fused with another compound such as a compound to increase the half life of the polypeptide for example polyethylene glycol or iv one in which the additional amino acids are fused to the mature polypeptide such as an IgG Fc fusion region peptide or leader or secretory sequence or a sequence which is employed for purification of the mature polypeptide or a proprotein sequence. Such fragments derivatives and analogs are deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art from the teachings herein.

Of particular interest are substitutions of charged amino acids with another charged amino acid and with neutral or negatively charged amino acids. The latter results in proteins with reduced positive charge to improve the characteristics of the TR17 receptor protein. The prevention of aggregation is highly desirable. Aggregation of proteins not only results in a loss of activity but can also be problematic when preparing pharmaceutical formulations because they can be immunogenic. Pinckard et al. 2 331 340 1967 Robbins et al 36 838 845 1987 Cleland et al. 10 307 377 1993 .

The replacement of amino acids can also change the selectivity of binding to cell surface receptors. Ostade et al. 361 266 268 1993 describes certain mutations resulting in selective binding of TNF to only one of the two known types of TNF receptors. Thus the TR17 polypeptides receptor of the present invention may include one or more amino acid substitutions deletions or additions either from natural mutations or human manipulation.

As indicated changes are preferably of a minor nature such as conservative amino acid substitutions that do not significantly affect the folding or activity of the protein see Table II .

In specific embodiments the number of substitutions additions or deletions in the amino acid sequence of and or any of the polypeptide fragments described herein e.g. the extracellular domain or intracellular domain is 75 70 60 50 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 or 30 20 20 15 20 10 15 10 10 1 5 10 1 5 1 3 or 1 2.

In another embodiment site directed changes at the amino acid level of TR17 can be made by replacing a particular amino acid with a conservative substitution.

Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention. The resulting TR17 of the invention may be routinely screened for TR17 functional activity and or physical properties such as for example enhanced or reduced stability and or solubility . Preferably the resulting proteins of the invention have an increased and or a decreased TR17 functional activity. More preferably the resulting TR17 proteins of the invention have more than one increased and or decreased TR17 functional activity and or physical property.

Amino acids in the TR17 proteins of the present invention that are essential for function can be identified by methods known in the art such as site directed mutagenesis or alanine scanning mutagenesis Cunningham and Wells 244 1081 1085 1989 . The latter procedure introduces single alanine mutations at every residue in the molecule. The resulting mutant molecules are then tested for biological activity such as receptor binding or in vitro proliferative activity. Sites that are critical for ligand receptor binding can also be determined by structural analysis such as crystallization nuclear magnetic resonance or photoaffinity labeling Smith et al. 224 899 904 1992 and de Vos et al. 255 306 312 1992 .

Of special interest are substitutions of charged amino acids with other charged or neutral amino acids which may produce proteins with highly desirable improved characteristics such as less aggregation. Aggregation may not only reduce activity but also be problematic when preparing pharmaceutical formulations because aggregates can be immunogenic Pinckard et al. 2 331 340 1967 Robbins et al. Diabetes 36 838 845 1987 Cleland et al. 10 307 377 1993 .

P or C. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention. The resulting TR17 proteins of the invention may be routinely screened for TR17 functional activities and or physical properties such as for example enhanced or reduced stability and or solubility described throughout the specification and known in the art. Preferably the resulting proteins of the invention have an increased and or a decreased TR17 functional activity. More preferably the resulting TR17 proteins of the invention have more than one increased and or decreased TR17 functional activity and or physical property.

To improve or alter the characteristics of TR17 polypeptides protein engineering may be employed. Recombinant DNA technology known to those skilled in the art can be used to create novel mutant proteins or muteins including single or multiple amino acid substitutions deletions additions or fusion proteins. Such modified polypeptides can show e.g. enhanced activity or increased stability. In addition they may be purified in higher yields and show better solubility than the corresponding natural polypeptide at least under certain purification and storage conditions.

Non naturally occurring variants may be produced using art known mutagenesis techniques which include but are not limited to oligonucleotide mediated mutagenesis alanine scanning PCR mutagenesis site directed mutagenesis see e.g. Carter et al. 13 4331 1986 and Zoller et al. 10 6487 1982 cassette mutagenesis see e.g. Wells et al. 34 315 1985 restriction selection mutagenesis see e.g. Wells et al. 317 415 1986 .

Thus the invention also encompasses TR17 derivatives and analogs that have one or more amino acid residues deleted added or substituted to generate TR17 polypeptides that are better suited for expression scale up etc. in the host cells chosen. For example cysteine residues can be deleted or substituted with another amino acid residue in order to eliminate disulfide bridges N linked glycosylation sites can be altered or eliminated to achieve for example expression of a homogeneous product that is more easily recovered and purified from yeast hosts which are known to hyperglycosylate N linked sites. To this end a variety of amino acid substitutions at one or both of the first or third amino acid positions on any one or more of the glycosylation recognitions sequences in the TR17 polypeptides of the invention and or an amino acid deletion at the second position of any one or more such recognition sequences will prevent glycosylation of the TR17 at the modified tripeptide sequence see e.g. Miyajimo et al. 5 6 1193 1197 . Additionally one or more of the amino acid residues of the polypeptides of the invention e.g. arginine and lysine residues may be deleted or substituted with another residue to eliminate undesired processing by proteases such as for example furins or kexins.

The polypeptides of the present invention include a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acids from about 1 to about 293 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acids from about 2 to about 293 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of the TR17 extracellular domain a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of the TR17 cysteine rich domain a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of the TR17 transmembrane domain a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of the intracellular domain of TR17 and a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of the TR17 extracellular domain and one of the TR17 intracellular domains with all or part of the transmembrane domain deleted as well as polypeptides which are at least 80 identical more preferably at least 90 or 95 identical still more preferably at least 96 97 98 99 or 100 identical to the polypeptides described above e.g. the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO 2 and also include portions of such polypeptides with at least 30 amino acids and more preferably at least 50 or at least 100 amino acids. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.

By a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least for example 95 identical to a reference amino acid sequence of a TR17 polypeptide is intended that the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide is identical to the reference sequence except that the polypeptide sequence may include up to five amino acid alterations per each 100 amino acids of the reference amino acid of the TR17 receptor. In other words to obtain a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least 95 identical to a reference amino acid sequence up to 5 of the amino acid residues in the reference sequence may be deleted or substituted with another amino acid or a number of amino acids up to 5 of the total amino acid residues in the reference sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence. These alterations of the reference sequence may occur at the amino or carboxy terminal positions of the reference amino acid sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions interspersed either individually among residues in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence.

As a practical matter whether any particular polypeptide is at least 90 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to for instance the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 2 can be determined conventionally using known computer programs such the Bestfit program Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package Version 8 for Unix Genetics Computer Group University Research Park 575 Science Drive Madison Wis. 53711 . When using Bestfit or any other sequence alignment program to determine whether a particular sequence is for instance 95 identical to a reference sequence according to the present invention the parameters are set of course such that the percentage of identity is calculated over the full length of the reference amino acid sequence and that gaps in homology of up to 5 of the total number of amino acid residues in the reference sequence are allowed.

In a specific embodiment the identity between a reference query sequence a sequence of the present invention and a subject sequence also referred to as a global sequence alignment is determined using the FASTDB computer program based on the algorithm of Brutlag et al. 6 237 245 1990 . Preferred parameters used in a FASTDB amino acid alignment are Matrix PAM 0 k tuple 2 Mismatch Penalty 1 Joining Penalty 20 Randomization Group Length 0 Cutoff Score 1 Window Size sequence length Gap Penalty 5 Gap Size Penalty 0.05 Window Size 500 or the length of the subject amino acid sequence whichever is shorter. According to this embodiment if the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence due to N or C terminal deletions not because of internal deletions a manual correction is made to the results to take into consideration the fact that the FASTDB program does not account for N and C terminal truncations of the subject sequence when calculating global percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the N and C termini relative to the query sequence the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of residues of the query sequence that are N and C terminal of the subject sequence which are not matched aligned with a corresponding subject residue as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. A determination of whether a residue is matched aligned is determined by results of the FASTDB sequence alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity calculated by the above FASTDB program using the specified parameters to arrive at a final percent identity score. This final percent identity score is what is used for the purposes of this embodiment. Only residues to the N and C termini of the subject sequence which are not matched aligned with the query sequence are considered for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score. That is only query residue positions outside the farthest N and C terminal residues of the subject sequence. For example a 90 amino acid residue subject sequence is aligned with a 100 residue query sequence to determine percent identity. The deletion occurs at the N terminus of the subject sequence and therefore the FASTDB alignment does not show a matching alignment of the first 10 residues at the N terminus. The 10 unpaired residues represent 10 of the sequence number of residues at the N and C termini not matched total number of residues in the query sequence so 10 is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the FASTDB program. If the remaining 90 residues were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90 . In another example a 90 residue subject sequence is compared with a 100 residue query sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so there are no residues at the N or C termini of the subject sequence which are not matched aligned with the query. In this case the percent identity calculated by FASTDB is not manually corrected. Once again only residue positions outside the N and C terminal ends of the subject sequence as displayed in the FASTDB alignment which are not matched aligned with the query sequence are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are made for the purposes of this embodiment.

Antibodies of the present invention may be used for example but not limited to to purify detect and target the polypeptides of the present invention including both in vitro and in vivo diagnostic and therapeutic methods. For example the antibodies have use in immunoassays for qualitatively and quantitatively measuring levels of the polypeptides of the present invention in biological samples. See e.g. Harlow et al. Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 2nd ed. 1988 incorporated by reference herein in its entirety .

By way of another non limiting example antibodies of the invention may be administered to individuals as a form of passive immunization. Alternatively antibodies of the present invention may be used for epitope mapping to identify the epitope s bound by the antibody. Epitopes identified in this way may in turn for example be used as vaccine candidates i.e. to immunize an individual to elicit antibodies against the naturally occurring forms of TR17.

As discussed in more detail below the antibodies of the present invention may be used either alone or in combination with other compositions. The antibodies may further be recombinantly fused to a heterologous polypeptide at the N or C terminus or chemically conjugated including covalently and non covalently conjugations to polypeptides or other compositions. For example antibodies of the present invention may be recombinantly fused or conjugated to molecules useful as labels in detection assays and effector molecules such as heterologous polypeptides drugs radionuclides or toxins. See e.g. PCT publications WO 92 08495 WO 91 14438 WO 89 12624 U.S. Pat. No. 5 314 995 and EP 396 387.

The antibodies of the invention include derivatives that are modified i.e by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule to the antibody such that covalent attachment does not prevent the antibody from generating an anti idiotypic response. For example but not by way of limitation the antibody derivatives include antibodies that have been modified e.g. by glycosylation acetylation pegylation phosphylation amidation derivatization by known protecting blocking groups proteolytic cleavage linkage to a cellular ligand or other protein etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications may be carried out by known techniques including but not limited to specific chemical cleavage acetylation formylation metabolic synthesis of tunicamycin etc. Additionally the derivative may contain one or more non classical amino acids.

The antibodies of the present invention may be generated by any suitable method known in the art. Polyclonal antibodies to an antigen of interest can be produced by various procedures well known in the art. For example a polypeptide of the invention can be administered to various host animals including but not limited to rabbits mice rats etc. to induce the production of sera containing polyclonal antibodies specific for the antigen. Various adjuvants may be used to increase the immunological response depending on the host species and include but are not limited to Freund s complete and incomplete mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide surface active substances such as lysolecithin pluronic polyols polyanions peptides oil emulsions keyhole limpet hemocyanins dinitrophenol and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG bacille Calmette Guerin and . Such adjuvants are also well known in the art.

Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using a wide variety of techniques known in the art including the use of hybridoma recombinant and phage display technologies or a combination thereof. For example monoclonal antibodies can be produced using hybridoma techniques including those known in the art and taught for example in Harlow et al. Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 2nd ed. 1988 Hammerling et al. in Monoclonal Antibodies and T Cell Hybridomas 563 681 Elsevier N.Y. 1981 said references incorporated by reference in their entireties . The term monoclonal antibody as used herein is not limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology. The term monoclonal antibody refers to an antibody that is derived from a single clone including any eukaryotic prokaryotic or phage clone and not the method by which it is produced.

Methods for producing and screening for specific antibodies using hybridoma technology are routine and well known in the art and are discussed in detail in the Examples e.g. Example 2 . In a non limiting example mice can be immunized with a polypeptide of the invention or a cell expressing such peptide. Once an immune response is detected e.g. antibodies specific for the antigen are detected in the mouse serum the mouse spleen is harvested and splenocytes isolated. The splenocytes are then fused by well known techniques to any suitable myeloma cells for example cells from cell line SP20 available from the ATCC . Hybridomas are selected and cloned by limited dilution. The hybridoma clones are then assayed by methods known in the art for cells that secrete antibodies capable of binding a polypeptide of the invention. Ascites fluid which generally contains high levels of antibodies can be generated by immunizing mice with positive hybridoma clones.

Accordingly the present invention provides methods of generating monoclonal antibodies as well as antibodies produced by the method comprising culturing a hybridoma cell secreting an antibody of the invention wherein preferably the hybridoma is generated by fusing splenocytes isolated from a mouse immunized with an antigen of the invention with myeloma cells and then screening the hybridomas resulting from the fusion for hybridoma clones that secrete an antibody able to bind a polypeptide of the invention.

Protocols for generating EBV transformed B cell lines are commonly known in the art such as for example the protocol outlined in Chapter 7.22 of Current Protocols in Immunology Coligan et al. Eds. 1994 John Wiley Sons NY which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference herein. The source of B cells for transformation is commonly human peripheral blood but B cells for transformation may also be derived from other sources including but not limited to lymph nodes tonsil spleen tumor tissue and infected tissues. Tissues are generally made into single cell suspensions prior to EBV transformation. Investigators may also choose to perform selection procedures that will enrich the sample for B cells that are antigen reactive. For example one method of enriching for antigen reactive B cells is panning on a plastic dish that has been coated with antigen. Antigen reactive B cells may then be eluted from the plastic dish and used for transformation. Alternatively it is possible to enrich for antigen reactive B cells using fluorescence activated cells sorting FACS . In this method one might use fluorescently labelled antigen to sort out a population of antigen reactive B cells from non antigen reactive B cells an other cells types. Both FACS analysis and panning may also be performed in a manner so as to enrich for B cells as opposed to antigen reactive B cells. The advantage of selecting for total B cells populations is that one is more likely to include plasma cells or B cells actively secreteing immunoglobulin that might be missed in procedures that require the presence of cell surface immunoglobulin for detection. Growth of EBV infected cells is promoted by monocytes so investigators may wish to take care not to exclude these form culture or to resupply monocytes after selection procedures. Additionally steps may be taken to either physically remove or inactivate T cells e.g. by treatment with cyclosporin A in B cell containing samples because T cells from individuals seropositive for anti EBV antibodies can suppress B cell immortalization by EBV.

In general the sample containing human B cells is innoculated with EBV and cultured for 3 4 weeks. A typical source of EBV is the culture supernatant of the B95 8 cell line ATCC VR 1492 . Physical signs of EBV transformation can generally be seen towards the end of the 3 4 week culture period. By phase contrast microscopy transformed cells may appear large clear hairy and tend to aggregate in tight clusters of cells. Initially EBV lines are generally polyclonal. However over prolonged periods of cell cultures EBV lines may become monoclonal or polyclonal as a result of the selective outgrowth of particular B cell clones. Alternatively polyclonal EBV transformed lines may be subcloned e.g. by limiting dilution culture or fused with a suitable fusion partner and plated at limiting dilution to obtain monoclonal B cell lines. Suitable fusion partners for EBV transformed cell lines include mouse myeloma cell lines e.g. SP2 0 X63 Ag8.653 heteromyeloma cell lines human x mouse e.g SPAM 8 SBC H20 and CB F7 and human cell lines e.g. GM 1500 SKO 007 RPMI 8226 and KR 4 . Thus the present invention also provides a method of generating polyclonal or monoclonal human antibodies against polypeptides of the invention or fragments thereof comprising EBV transformation of human B cells.

Antibody fragments which recognize specific epitopes may be generated by known techniques. For example Fab and F ab 2 fragments of the invention may be produced by proteolytic cleavage of immunoglobulin molecules using enzymes such as papain to produce Fab fragments or pepsin to produce F ab 2 fragments . F ab 2 fragments contain the variable region the light chain constant region and the CH1 domain of the heavy chain.

For example the antibodies of the present invention can also be generated using various phage display methods known in the art. In phage display methods functional antibody domains are displayed on the surface of phage particles which carry the polynucleotide sequences encoding them. In a particular embodiment such phage can be utilized to display antigen binding domains expressed from a repertoire or combinatorial antibody library e.g. human or murine . Phage expressing an antigen binding domain that binds the antigen of interest can be selected or identified with antigen e.g. using labeled antigen or antigen bound or captured to a solid surface or bead. Phage used in these methods are typically filamentous phage including fd and M13 binding domains expressed from phage with Fab Fv or disulfide stabilized Fv antibody domains recombinantly fused to either the phage gene III or gene VIII protein. Examples of phage display methods that can be used to make the antibodies of the present invention include those disclosed in Brinkman et al. J. Immunol. Methods 182 41 50 1995 Ames et al. J. Immunol. Methods 184 177 186 1995 Ketteborough et al. Eur. J. Immunol. 24 952 958 1994 Persic et al. Gene 187 9 18 1997 Burton et al.

As described in the above references after phage selection the antibody coding regions from the phage can be isolated and used to generate whole antibodies including human antibodies or any other desired antigen binding fragment and expressed in any desired host including mammalian cells insect cells plant cells yeast and bacteria e.g. as described in detail below. For example techniques to recombinantly produce Fab Fab and F ab 2 fragments can also be employed using methods known in the art such as those disclosed in PCT publication WO 92 22324 Mullinax et al. BioTechniques 12 6 864 869 1992 and Sawai et al. AJRI 34 26 34 1995 and Better et al. Science 240 1041 1043 1988 said references incorporated by reference in their entireties .

Examples of techniques which can be used to produce single chain Fvs and antibodies include those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 946 778 and 5 258 498 Huston et al. Methods in Enzymology 203 46 88 1991 Shu et al. PNAS 90 7995 7999 1993 and Skerra et al. Science 240 1038 1040 1988 . For some uses including in vivo use of antibodies in humans and in vitro detection assays it may be preferable to use chimeric humanized or human antibodies. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different animal species such as antibodies having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal antibody and a human immunoglobulin constant region. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. See e.g. Morrison Science 229 1202 1985 Oi et al. BioTechniques 4 214 1986 Gillies et al. 1989 J. Immunol. Methods 125 191 202 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 807 715 4 816 567 and 4 816397 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non human species antibody that binds the desired antigen having one or more complementarity determining regions CDRs from the non human species and a framework regions from a human immunoglobulin molecule. Often framework residues in the human framework regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter preferably improve antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art e.g. by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. See e.g. Queen et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 585 089 Riechmann et al. Nature 332 323 1988 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Antibodies can be humanized using a variety of techniques known in the art including for example CDR grafting EP 239 400 PCT publication WO 91 09967 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 225 539 5 530 101 and 5 585 089 veneering or resurfacing EP 592 106 EP 519 596 Padlan Molecular Immunology 28 4 5 489 498 1991 Studnicka et al.

Completely human antibodies are particularly desirable for therapeutic treatment of human patients. Human antibodies can be made by a variety of methods known in the art including phage display methods described above using antibody libraries derived from human immunoglobulin sequences. See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 444 887 and 4 716 111 and PCT publications WO 98 46645 WO 98 50433 WO 98 24893 WO 98 16654 WO 96 34096 WO 96 33735 and WO 91 10741 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Human antibodies can also be produced using transgenic mice which are incapable of expressing functional endogenous immunoglobulins but which can express human immunoglobulin genes. For example the human heavy and light chain immunoglobulin gene complexes may be introduced randomly or by homologous recombination into mouse embryonic stem cells. Alternatively the human variable region constant region and diversity region may be introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells in addition to the human heavy and light chain genes. The mouse heavy and light chain immunoglobulin genes may be rendered non functional separately or simultaneously with the introduction of human immunoglobulin loci by homologous recombination. In particular homozygous deletion of the JH region prevents endogenous antibody production. The modified embryonic stem cells are expanded and microinjected into blastocysts to produce chimeric mice. The chimeric mice are then bred to produce homozygous offspring which express human antibodies. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen e.g. all or a portion of a polypeptide of the invention. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained from the immunized transgenic mice using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus using such a technique it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG IgA IgM and IgE antibodies. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies see Lonberg and Huszar Int. Rev. Immunol. 13 65 93 1995 . For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies see e.g. PCT publications WO 98 24893 WO 92 01047 WO 96 34096 WO 96 33735 European Patent No. 0 598 877 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 413 923 5 625 126 5 633 425 5 569 825 5 661 016 5 545 806 5 814 318 5 885 793 5 916 771 5 939 598 6 075 181 and 6 114 598 which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. In addition companies such as ABGENIX Inc. Freemont Calif. and Genpharm San Jose Calif. can be engaged to provide human antibodies directed against a selected antigen using technology similar to that described above.

Completely human antibodies which recognize a selected epitope can be generated using a technique referred to as guided selection. In this approach a selected non human monoclonal antibody e.g. a mouse antibody is used to guide the selection of a completely human antibody recognizing the same epitope. Jespers et al. Bio technology 12 899 903 1988 .

Further antibodies to the polypeptides of the invention can in turn be utilized to generate anti idiotype antibodies that mimic polypeptides of the invention using techniques well known to those skilled in the art. See e.g. Greenspan Bona FASEB J. 7 5 437 444 1989 and Nissinoff J. Immunol. 147 8 2429 2438 1991 . For example antibodies which bind to and competitively inhibit polypeptide multimerization and or binding of a polypeptide of the invention to a ligand can be used to generate anti idiotypes that mimic the polypeptide multimerization and or binding domain and as a consequence bind to and neutralize polypeptide and or its ligand. Such neutralizing anti idiotypes or Fab fragments of such anti idiotypes can be used in therapeutic regimens to neutralize polypeptide ligand. For example such anti idiotypic antibodies can be used to bind a polypeptide of the invention and or to bind its ligands receptors and thereby activate or block its biological activity.

Intrabodies of the invention can be produced using methods known in the art such as those disclosed and reviewed in Chen et al. 5 595 601 1994 Marasco W. A. 4 11 15 1997 Rondon and Marasco 51 257 283 1997 Proba et al. 275 245 253 1998 Cohen et al. 17 2445 2456 1998 Ohage and Steipe 291 1119 1128 1999 Ohage et al. 291 1129 1134 1999 Wirtz and Steipe 8 2245 2250 1999 Zhu et al. 231 207 222 1999 and references cited therein. In particular a CCR5 intrabody has been produced by Steinberger et al. 97 805 810 2000 .

The invention further provides polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody of the invention and fragments thereof. The invention also encompasses polynucleotides that hybridize under stringent or lower stringency hybridization conditions e.g. as defined supra to polynucleotides that encode an antibody preferably that specifically binds to a TR17 polypeptide of the invention preferably an antibody that binds to a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 2.

The polynucleotides may be obtained and the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotides determined by any method known in the art. For example if the nucleotide sequence of the antibody is known a polynucleotide encoding the antibody may be assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides e.g. as described in Kutmeier et al. BioTechniques 17 242 1994 which briefly involves the synthesis of overlapping oligonucleotides containing portions of the sequence encoding the antibody annealing and ligating of those oligonucleotides and then amplification of the ligated oligonucleotides by PCR.

Alternatively a polynucleotide encoding an antibody may be generated from nucleic acid from a suitable source. If a clone containing a nucleic acid encoding a particular antibody is not available but the sequence of the antibody molecule is known a nucleic acid encoding the immunoglobulin may be chemically synthesized or obtained from a suitable source e.g. an antibody cDNA library or a cDNA library generated from or nucleic acid preferably poly A RNA isolated from any tissue or cells expressing the antibody such as hybridoma cells selected to express an antibody of the invention by PCR amplification using synthetic primers hybridizable to the 3 and 5 ends of the sequence or by cloning using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the particular gene sequence to identify e.g. a cDNA clone from a cDNA library that encodes the antibody. Amplified nucleic acids generated by PCR may then be cloned into replicable cloning vectors using any method well known in the art.

Once the nucleotide sequence and corresponding amino acid sequence of the antibody is determined the nucleotide sequence of the antibody may be manipulated using methods well known in the art for the manipulation of nucleotide sequences e.g. recombinant DNA techniques site directed mutagenesis PCR etc. see for example the techniques described in Sambrook et al. 1990 Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual 2d Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. and Ausubel et al. eds. 1998 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons NY which are both incorporated by reference herein in their entireties to generate antibodies having a different amino acid sequence for example to create amino acid substitutions deletions and or insertions.

In a specific embodiment the amino acid sequence of the heavy and or light chain variable domains may be inspected to identify the sequences of the complementarity determining regions CDRs by methods that are well know in the art e.g. by comparison to known amino acid sequences of other heavy and light chain variable regions to determine the regions of sequence hypervariability. Using routine recombinant DNA techniques one or more of the CDRs may be inserted within framework regions e.g. into human framework regions to humanize a non human antibody as described supra. The framework regions may be naturally occurring or consensus framework regions and preferably human framework regions see e.g. Chothia et al. J. Mol. Biol. 278 457 479 1998 for a listing of human framework regions . Preferably the polynucleotide generated by the combination of the framework regions and CDRs encodes an antibody that specifically binds a polypeptide of the invention. Preferably as discussed supra one or more amino acid substitutions may be made within the framework regions and preferably the amino acid substitutions improve binding of the antibody to its antigen. Additionally such methods may be used to make amino acid substitutions or deletions of one or more variable region cysteine residues participating in an intrachain disulfide bond to generate antibody molecules lacking one or more intrachain disulfide bonds. Other alterations to the polynucleotide are encompassed by the present invention and within the skill of the art.

In addition techniques developed for the production of chimeric antibodies Morrison et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 81 851 855 1984 Neuberger et al. Nature 312 604 608 1984 Takeda et al. Nature 314 452 454 1985 by splicing genes from a mouse antibody molecule of appropriate antigen specificity together with genes from a human antibody molecule of appropriate biological activity can be used. As described supra a chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from different animal species such as those having a variable region derived from a murine mAb and a human immunoglobulin constant region e.g. humanized antibodies.

Alternatively techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies U.S. Pat. No. 4 946 778 Bird Science 242 423 42 1988 Huston et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85 5879 5883 1988 and Ward et al. Nature 334 544 54 1989 can be adapted to produce single chain antibodies. Single chain antibodies are formed by linking the heavy and light chain fragments of the Fv region via an amino acid bridge resulting in a single chain polypeptide. Techniques for the assembly of functional Fv fragments in may also be used Skerra et al. Science 242 1038 1041 1988 .

The antibodies of the invention can be produced by any method known in the art for the synthesis of antibodies in particular by chemical synthesis or preferably by recombinant expression techniques. Methods of producing antibodies include but are not limited to hybridoma technology EBV transformation and other methods discussed herein as well as through the use recombinant DNA technology as discussed below.

Recombinant expression of an antibody of the invention or fragment derivative or analog thereof e.g. a heavy or light chain of an antibody of the invention or a single chain antibody of the invention requires construction of an expression vector containing a polynucleotide that encodes the antibody. Once a polynucleotide encoding an antibody molecule or a heavy or light chain of an antibody or portion thereof preferably containing the heavy or light chain variable domain of the invention has been obtained the vector for the production of the antibody molecule may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Thus methods for preparing a protein by expressing a polynucleotide containing an antibody encoding nucleotide sequence are described herein. Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include for example in vitro recombinant DNA techniques synthetic techniques and in vivo genetic recombination. The invention thus provides replicable vectors comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody molecule of the invention or a heavy or light chain thereof or a heavy or light chain variable domain operably linked to a promoter. Such vectors may include the nucleotide sequence encoding the constant region of the antibody molecule see e.g. PCT Publication WO 86 05807 PCT Publication WO 89 01036 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 122 464 and the variable domain of the antibody may be cloned into such a vector for expression of the entire heavy or light chain.

The expression vector is transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce an antibody of the invention. Thus the invention includes host cells containing a polynucleotide encoding an antibody of the invention or a heavy or light chain thereof or a single chain antibody of the invention operably linked to a heterologous promoter. In preferred embodiments for the expression of double chained antibodies vectors encoding both the heavy and light chains may be co expressed in the host cell for expression of the entire immunoglobulin molecule as detailed below.

A variety of host expression vector systems may be utilized to express the antibody molecules of the invention. Such host expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of interest may be produced and subsequently purified but also represent cells which may when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences express an antibody molecule of the invention in situ. These include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria e.g. transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences yeast e.g. transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors e.g. baculovirus containing antibody coding sequences plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors e.g. cauliflower mosaic virus CaMV tobacco mosaic virus TMV or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors e.g. Ti plasmid containing antibody coding sequences or mammalian cell systems e.g. COS CHO BHK 293 3T3 cells harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells e.g. metallothionein promoter or from mammalian viruses e.g. the adenovirus late promoter the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter . Preferably bacterial cells such as and more preferably eukaryotic cells especially for the expression of whole recombinant antibody molecule are used for the expression of a recombinant antibody molecule. For example mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells CHO in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for antibodies Foecking et al. Gene 45 101 1986 Cockett et al. Bio Technology 8 2 1990 .

In bacterial systems a number of expression vectors may be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the antibody molecule being expressed. For example when a large quantity of such a protein is to be produced for the generation of pharmaceutical compositions of an antibody molecule vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified may be desirable. Such vectors include but are not limited to the expression vector pUR278 Ruther et al. 2 1791 1983 in which the antibody coding sequence may be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a fusion protein is produced pIN vectors Inouye Inouye Nucleic Acids Res. 13 3101 3109 1985 Van Heeke Schuster J. Biol. Chem. 24 5503 5509 1989 and the like. pGEX vectors may also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione S transferase GST . In general such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to matrix glutathione agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.

In an insect system nuclear polyhedrosis virus AcNPV is used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in cells. The antibody coding sequence may be cloned individually into non essential regions for example the polyhedrin gene of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter for example the polyhedrin promoter .

In mammalian host cells a number of viral based expression systems may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector the antibody coding sequence of interest may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription translation control complex e.g. the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non essential region of the viral genome e.g. region E1 or E3 will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the antibody molecule in infected hosts. e.g. see Logan Shenk Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81 355 359 1984 . Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements transcription terminators etc. see Bittner et al. Methods in Enzymol. 153 51 544 1987 .

In addition a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications e.g. glycosylation and processing e.g. cleavage of protein products may be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript glycosylation and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO VERY BHK Hela COS MDCK 293 3T3 WI38 and in particular breast cancer cell lines such as for example BT483 Hs578T HTB2 BT20 and T47D and normal mammary gland cell line such as for example CRL7030 and Hs578Bst.

For long term high yield production of recombinant proteins stable expression is preferred. For example cell lines which stably express the antibody molecule may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements e.g. promoter enhancer sequences transcription terminators polyadenylation sites etc. and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1 2 days in an enriched media and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method may advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express the antibody molecule. Such engineered cell lines may be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compounds that interact directly or indirectly with the antibody molecule.

A number of selection systems may be used including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase Wigler et al. Cell 11 223 1977 hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase Szybalska Szybalski Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 48 202 1992 and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase Lowy et al. 22 817 1980 genes can be employed in tk hgprt or aprt cells respectively. Also antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes dhfr which confers resistance to methotrexate Wigler et al. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77 357 1980 O Hare et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78 1527 1981 gpt which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid Mulligan Berg Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The expression levels of an antibody molecule can be increased by vector amplification for a review see Bebbington and Hentschel The use of vectors based on gene amplification for the expression of cloned genes in mammalian cells in DNA cloning Vol. 3. Academic Press New York 1987 . When a marker in the vector system expressing antibody is amplifiable increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the antibody gene production of the antibody will also increase Crouse et al. 3 257 1983 .

Vectors which use glutamine synthase GS or DHFR as the selectable markers can be amplified in the presence of the drugs methionine sulphoximine or methotrexate respectively. An advantage of glutamine synthase based vectors are the availabilty of cell lines e.g. the murine myeloma cell line NSO which are glutamine synthase negative. Glutamine synthase expression systems can also function in glutamine synthase expressing cells e.g. Chinese Hamster Ovary CHO cells by providing additional inhibitor to prevent the functioning of the endogenous gene. Vectors that use glutamine synthase as the selectable marker include but are not limited to the pEE6 expression vector described in Stephens and Cockett 17 7110 1989 . A glutamine synthase expression system and components thereof are detailed in PCT publications WO87 04462 WO86 05807 WO89 01036 WO89 10404 and WO91 06657 which are incorporated in their entireties by reference herein. Additionally glutamine synthase expression vectors that may be used according to the present invention are commercially available from suplliers including for example Lonza Biologics Inc. Portsmouth N.H. . Expression and production of monoclonal antibodies using a GS expression system in murine myeloma cells is described in Bebbington et al. 10 169 1992 and in Biblia and Robinson 11 1 1995 which are incorporated in their entireties by reference herein.

The host cell may be co transfected with two expression vectors of the invention the first vector encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding a light chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors may contain identical selectable markers which enable equal expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides. Alternatively a single vector may be used which encodes and is capable of expressing both heavy and light chain polypeptides. In such situations the light chain should be placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain Proudfoot Nature 322 52 1986 Kohler Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77 2197 1980 . The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains may comprise cDNA or genomic DNA.

Once an antibody molecule of the invention has been produced by an animal chemically synthesized or recombinantly expressed it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of an immunoglobulin molecule for example by chromatography e.g. ion exchange affinity particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A and sizing column chromatography centrifugation differential solubility or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. In addition the antibodies of the present invention or fragments thereof can be fused to heterologous polypeptide sequences described herein or otherwise known in the art to facilitate purification.

The present invention encompasses antibodies recombinantly fused or chemically conjugated including both covalently and non covalently conjugations to a polypeptide or portion thereof preferably at least 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 or 100 amino acids of the polypeptide of the present invention to generate fusion proteins. The fusion does not necessarily need to be direct but may occur through linker sequences. The antibodies may be specific for antigens other than polypeptides or portion thereof preferably at least 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 or 100 amino acids of the polypeptide of the present invention. For example antibodies may be used to target the polypeptides of the present invention to particular cell types either in vitro or in vivo by fusing or conjugating the polypeptides of the present invention to antibodies specific for particular cell surface receptors. Antibodies fused or conjugated to the polypeptides of the present invention may also be used in in vitro immunoassays and purification methods using methods known in the art. See e.g. Harbor et al. supra and PCT publication WO 93 21232 EP 439 095 Naramura et al. Immunol. Lett. 39 91 99 1994 U.S. Pat. No. 5 474 981 Gillies et al. PNAS 89 1428 1432 1992 Fell et al. J. Immunol. 146 2446 2452 1991 which are incorporated by reference in their entireties.

The present invention further includes compositions comprising the polypeptides of the present invention fused or conjugated to antibody domains other than the variable regions. For example the polypeptides of the present invention may be fused or conjugated to an antibody Fc region or portion thereof. The antibody portion fused to a polypeptide of the present invention may comprise the constant region hinge region CH1 domain CH2 domain and CH3 domain or any combination of whole domains or portions thereof. The polypeptides may also be fused or conjugated to the above antibody portions to form multimers. For example Fc portions fused to the polypeptides of the present invention can form dimers through disulfide bonding between the Fc portions. Higher multimeric forms can be made by fusing the polypeptides to portions of IgA and IgM. Methods for fusing or conjugating the polypeptides of the present invention to antibody portions are known in the art. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 336 603 5 622 929 5 359 046 5 349 053 5 447 851 5 112 946 EP 307 434 EP 367 166 PCT publications WO 96 04388 WO 91 06570 Ashkenazi et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88 10535 10539 1991 Zheng et al. J. Immunol. 154 5590 5600 1995 and Vil et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 11337 11341 1992 said references incorporated by reference in their entireties .

As discussed supra the polypeptides corresponding to a TR17 polypeptide polypeptide fragment or a variant of SEQ ID NO 2 may be fused or conjugated to the above antibody portions to increase the in vivo half life of the polypeptides or for use in immunoassays using methods known in the art. Further the polypeptides corresponding to SEQ ID NO 2 may be fused or conjugated to the above antibody portions to facilitate purification. One reported example describes chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4 polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins. EP 394 827 Traunecker et al. Nature 331 84 86 1988 . The polypeptides of the present invention fused or conjugated to an antibody having disulfide linked dimeric structures due to the IgG may also be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules than the monomeric secreted protein or protein fragment alone. Fountoulakis et al. J. Biochem. 270 3958 3964 1995 . In many cases the Fc part in a fusion protein is beneficial in therapy and diagnosis and thus can result in for example improved pharmacokinetic properties. EP A 232 262 . Alternatively deleting the Fc part after the fusion protein has been expressed detected and purified would be desired. For example the Fc portion may hinder therapy and diagnosis if the fusion protein is used as an antigen for immunizations. In drug discovery for example human proteins such as hIL 5 have been fused with Fc portions for the purpose of high throughput screening assays to identify antagonists of hIL 5. See Bennett et al. J. Molecular Recognition 8 52 58 1995 Johanson et al. J. Biol. Chem. 270 9459 9471 1995 .

Moreover the antibodies or fragments thereof of the present invention can be fused to marker sequences such as a peptide to facilitate purification. In preferred embodiments the marker amino acid sequence is a hexa histidine peptide such as the tag provided in a pQE vector QIAGEN Inc. 9259 Eton Avenue Chatsworth Calif. 91311 among others many of which are commercially available. As described in Gentz et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 821 824 1989 for instance hexa histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein.

Other peptide tags useful for purification include but are not limited to the HA tag which corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein Wilson et al. Cell 37 767 1984 and the flag tag.

The present invention further encompasses antibodies or fragments thereof conjugated to a diagnostic or therapeutic agent. The antibodies can be used diagnostically to for example monitor the development or progression of a tumor as part of a clinical testing procedure to e.g. determine the efficacy of a given treatment regimen. Detection can be facilitated by coupling the antibody to a detectable substance. Examples of detectable substances include various enzymes prosthetic groups fluorescent materials luminescent materials bioluminescent materials radioactive materials positron emitting metals using various positron emission tomographies and nonradioactive paramagnetic metal ions. The detectable substance may be coupled or conjugated either directly to the antibody or fragment thereof or indirectly through an intermediate such as for example a linker known in the art using techniques known in the art.

Alternatively an antibody can be conjugated to a second antibody to form an antibody heteroconjugate as described by Segal in U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

An antibody with or without a therapeutic moiety conjugated to it administered alone or in combination with cytotoxic factor s and or cytokine s can be used as a therapeutic.

The antibodies of the invention may be utilized for immunophenotyping of cell lines and biological samples. The translation product of the gene of the present invention may be useful as a cell specific marker or more specifically as a cellular marker that is differentially expressed at various stages of differentiation and or maturation of particular cell types. Monoclonal antibodies directed against a specific epitope or combination of epitopes will allow for the screening of cellular populations expressing the marker. Various techniques can be utilized using monoclonal antibodies to screen for cellular populations expressing the marker s and include magnetic separation using antibody coated magnetic beads panning with antibody attached to a solid matrix i.e. plate and flow cytometry See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 985 660 and Morrison et al. 96 737 49 1999 .

These techniques allow for the screening of particular populations of cells such as might be found with hematological malignancies i.e. minimal residual disease MRD in acute leukemic patients and non self cells in transplantations to prevent Graft versus Host Disease GVHD . Alternatively these techniques allow for the screening of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells capable of undergoing proliferation and or differentiation as might be found in human umbilical cord blood.

The antibodies of the invention may be assayed for immunospecific binding by any method known in the art. The immunoassays which can be used include but are not limited to competitive and non competitive assay systems using techniques such as western blots radioimmunoassays ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay sandwich immunoassays immunoprecipitation assays precipitin reactions gel diffusion precipitin reactions immunodiffusion assays agglutination assays complement fixation assays immunoradiometric assays fluorescent immunoassays protein A immunoassays to name but a few. Such assays are routine and well known in the art see e.g. Ausubel et al eds 1994 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Vol. 1 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . Exemplary immunoassays are described briefly below but are not intended by way of limitation .

Immunoprecipitation protocols generally comprise lysing a population of cells in a lysis buffer such as RIPA buffer 1 NP 40 or Triton X 100 1 sodium deoxycholate 0.1 SDS 0.15 M NaCl 0.01 M sodium phosphate at pH 7.2 1 Trasylol supplemented with protein phosphatase and or protease inhibitors e.g. EDTA PMSF aprotinin sodium vanadate adding the antibody of interest to the cell lysate incubating for a period of time e.g. 1 4 hours at 4 C. adding protein A and or protein G sepharose beads to the cell lysate incubating for about an hour or more at 4 C. washing the beads in lysis buffer and resuspending the beads in SDS sample buffer. The ability of the antibody of interest to immunoprecipitate a particular antigen can be assessed by e.g. western blot analysis. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the binding of the antibody to an antigen and decrease the background e.g. pre clearing the cell lysate with sepharose beads . For further discussion regarding immunoprecipitation protocols see e.g. Ausubel et al eds 1994 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Vol. 1 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York at 10.16.1.

Western blot analysis generally comprises preparing protein samples electrophoresis of the protein samples in a polyacrylamide gel e.g. 8 20 SDS PAGE depending on the molecular weight of the antigen transferring the protein sample from the polyacrylamide gel to a membrane such as nitrocellulose PVDF or nylon blocking the membrane in blocking solution e.g. PBS with 3 BSA or non fat milk washing the membrane in washing buffer e.g. PBS Tween 20 blocking the membrane with primary antibody the antibody of interest diluted in blocking buffer washing the membrane in washing buffer blocking the membrane with a secondary antibody which recognizes the primary antibody e.g. an anti human antibody conjugated to an enzymatic substrate e.g. horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase or radioactive molecule e.g. 32P or 125I diluted in blocking buffer washing the membrane in wash buffer and detecting the presence of the antigen. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected and to reduce the background noise. For further discussion regarding western blot protocols see e.g. Ausubel et al eds 1994 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Vol. 1 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York at 10.8.1.

ELISAs comprise preparing antigen coating the well of a 96 well microtiter plate with the antigen adding the antibody of interest conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate e.g. horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase to the well and incubating for a period of time and detecting the presence of the antigen. In ELISAs the antibody of interest does not have to be conjugated to a detectable compound instead a second antibody which recognizes the antibody of interest conjugated to a detectable compound may be added to the well. Further instead of coating the well with the antigen the antibody may be coated to the well. In this case a second antibody conjugated to a detectable compound may be added following the addition of the antigen of interest to the coated well. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected as well as other variations of ELISAs known in the art. For further discussion regarding ELISAs see e.g. Ausubel et al eds 1994 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Vol. 1 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York at 11.2.1.

The binding affinity of an antibody to an antigen and the off rate of an antibody antigen interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled antigen e.g. 3H or 125I with the antibody of interest in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled antigen and the detection of the antibody bound to the labeled antigen. The affinity of the antibody of interest for a particular antigen and the binding off rates can be determined from the data by scatchard plot analysis. Competition with a second antibody can also be determined using radioimmunoassays. In this case the antigen is incubated with antibody of interest conjugated to a labeled compound e.g. 3H or 125I in the presence of increasing amounts of an unlabeled second antibody.

In a preferred aspect the compound comprises nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody said nucleic acid sequences being part of expression vectors that express the antibody or fragments or chimeric proteins or heavy or light chains thereof in a suitable host. In particular such nucleic acid sequences have promoters operably linked to the antibody coding region said promoter being inducible or constitutive and optionally tissue specific. In another particular embodiment nucleic acid molecules are used in which the antibody coding sequences and any other desired sequences are flanked by regions that promote homologous recombination at a desired site in the genome thus providing for intrachromosomal expression of the antibody encoding nucleic acids Koller and Smithies Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 8932 8935 1989 Zijlstra et al. Nature 342 435 438 1989 . In specific embodiments the expressed antibody molecule is a single chain antibody alternatively the nucleic acid sequences include sequences encoding both the heavy and light chains or fragments thereof of the antibody.

Delivery of the nucleic acids into a patient may be either direct in which case the patient is directly exposed to the nucleic acid or nucleic acid carrying vectors or indirect in which case cells are first transformed with the nucleic acids in vitro then transplanted into the patient. These two approaches are known respectively as in vivo or ex vivo gene therapy.

In a specific embodiment the nucleic acid sequences are directly administered in vivo where it is expressed to produce the encoded product. This can be accomplished by any of numerous methods known in the art e.g. by constructing them as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that they become intracellular e.g. by infection using defective or attenuated retrovirals or other viral vectors see U.S. Pat. No. 4 980 286 or by direct injection of naked DNA or by use of microparticle bombardment e.g. a gene gun BIOLISTIC DUPONT or coating with lipids or cell surface receptors or transfecting agents encapsulation in liposomes microparticles or microcapsules or by administering them in linkage to a peptide which is known to enter the nucleus by administering it in linkage to a ligand subject to receptor mediated endocytosis see e.g. Wu and Wu J. Biol. Chem. 262 4429 4432 1987 which can be used to target cell types specifically expressing the receptors etc. In another embodiment nucleic acid ligand complexes can be formed in which the ligand comprises a fusogenic viral peptide to disrupt endosomes allowing the nucleic acid to avoid lysosomal degradation. In yet another embodiment the nucleic acid can be targeted in vivo for cell specific uptake and expression by targeting a specific receptor see e.g. PCT Publications WO 92 06180 WO 92 22635 WO92 20316 WO93 14188 WO 93 20221 . Alternatively the nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression by homologous recombination Koller and Smithies Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 8932 8935 1989 Zijlstra et al. Nature 342 435 438 1989 .

In a specific embodiment viral vectors that contains nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody of the invention are used. For example a retroviral vector can be used see Miller et al. Meth. Enzymol. 217 581 599 1993 . These retroviral vectors contain the components necessary for the correct packaging of the viral genome and integration into the host cell DNA. The nucleic acid sequences encoding the antibody to be used in gene therapy are cloned into one or more vectors which facilitates delivery of the gene into a patient. More detail about retroviral vectors can be found in Boesen et al. Biotherapy 6 291 302 1994 which describes the use of a retroviral vector to deliver the mdr1 gene to hematopoietic stem cells in order to make the stem cells more resistant to chemotherapy. Other references illustrating the use of retroviral vectors in gene therapy are Clowes et al. J. Clin. Invest. 93 644 651 1994 Kiem et al. Blood 83 1467 1473 1994 Salmons and Gunzberg Human Gene Therapy 4 129 141 1993 and Grossman and Wilson Curr. Opin. in Genetics and Devel. 3 110 114 1993 .

Adenoviruses are other viral vectors that can be used in gene therapy. Adenoviruses are especially attractive vehicles for delivering genes to respiratory epithelia. Adenoviruses naturally infect respiratory epithelia where they cause a mild disease. Other targets for adenovirus based delivery systems are liver the central nervous system endothelial cells and muscle. Adenoviruses have the advantage of being capable of infecting non dividing cells. Kozarsky and Wilson Current Opinion in Genetics and Development 3 499 503 1993 present a review of adenovirus based gene therapy. Bout et al. Human Gene Therapy 5 3 10 1994 demonstrated the use of adenovirus vectors to transfer genes to the respiratory epithelia of rhesus monkeys. Other instances of the use of adenoviruses in gene therapy can be found in Rosenfeld et al. Science 252 431 434 1991 Rosenfeld et al. 68 143 155 1992 Mastrangeli et al. J. Clin. Invest. 91 225 234 1993 PCT Publication WO94 12649 and Wang et al. Gene Therapy 2 775 783 1995 . In a preferred embodiment adenovirus vectors are used.

Adeno associated virus AAV has also been proposed for use in gene therapy Walsh et al. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 204 289 300 1993 U.S. Pat. No. 5 436 146 .

Another approach to gene therapy involves transferring a gene to cells in tissue culture by such methods as electroporation lipofection calcium phosphate mediated transfection or viral infection. Usually the method of transfer includes the transfer of a selectable marker to the cells. The cells are then placed under selection to isolate those cells that have taken up and are expressing the transferred gene. Those cells are then delivered to a patient.

In this embodiment the nucleic acid is introduced into a cell prior to administration in vivo of the resulting recombinant cell. Such introduction can be carried out by any method known in the art including but not limited to transfection electroporation microinjection infection with a viral or bacteriophage vector containing the nucleic acid sequences cell fusion chromosome mediated gene transfer microcell mediated gene transfer spheroplast fusion etc. Numerous techniques are known in the art for the introduction of foreign genes into cells see e.g. Loeffler and Behr Meth. Enzymol. 217 599 618 1993 Cohen et al. Meth. Enzymol. 217 618 644 1993 Cline Pharmac. Ther. 29 69 92m 1985 and may be used in accordance with the present invention provided that the necessary developmental and physiological functions of the recipient cells are not disrupted. The technique should provide for the stable transfer of the nucleic acid to the cell so that the nucleic acid is expressible by the cell and preferably heritable and expressible by its cell progeny.

The resulting recombinant cells can be delivered to a patient by various methods known in the art. Recombinant blood cells e.g. hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells are preferably administered intravenously. The amount of cells envisioned for use depends on the desired effect patient state etc. and can be determined by one skilled in the art.

Cells into which a nucleic acid can be introduced for purposes of gene therapy encompass any desired available cell type and include but are not limited to epithelial cells endothelial cells keratinocytes fibroblasts muscle cells hepatocytes blood cells such as T lymphocytes B lymphocytes monocytes macrophages neutrophils eosinophils megakaryocytes granulocytes various stem or progenitor cells in particular hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells e.g. as obtained from bone marrow umbilical cord blood peripheral blood fetal liver etc.

In an embodiment in which recombinant cells are used in gene therapy nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody are introduced into the cells such that they are expressible by the cells or their progeny and the recombinant cells are then administered in vivo for therapeutic effect. In a specific embodiment stem or progenitor cells are used. Any stem and or progenitor cells which can be isolated and maintained in vitro can potentially be used in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention see e.g. PCT Publication WO 94 08598 Stemple and Anderson Cell 71 973 985 1992 Rheinwald Meth. Cell Bio. 21A 229 1980 and Pittelkow and Scott Mayo Clinic Proc. 61 771 1986 .

The effect of the compound or composition on the cell line and or tissue sample can be determined utilizing techniques known to those of skill in the art including but not limited to rosette formation assays and cell lysis assays. In accordance with the invention in vitro assays which can be used to determine whether administration of a specific compound is indicated include in vitro cell culture assays in which a patient tissue sample is grown in culture and exposed to or otherwise administered a compound and the effect of such compound upon the tissue sample is observed.

The invention provides methods of treatment inhibition and prophylaxis by administration to a subject of an effective amount of a compound or pharmaceutical composition of the invention preferably an antibody of the invention.

In yet another embodiment the compound or composition can be delivered in a controlled release system. In one embodiment a pump may be used see Langer supra Sefton CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14 201 1987 Buchwald et al. Surgery 88 507 1980 Saudek et al. N. Engl. J. Med. 321 574 1989 . In another embodiment polymeric materials can be used see Medical Applications of Controlled Release Langer and Wise eds. CRC Pres.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88 1864 1868 1991 etc. Alternatively a nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression by homologous recombination.

The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions. Such compositions comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In a specific embodiment the term pharmaceutically acceptable means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals and more particularly in humans. The term carrier refers to a diluent adjuvant excipient or vehicle with which the therapeutic is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids such as water and oils including those of petroleum animal vegetable or synthetic origin such as peanut oil soybean oil mineral oil sesame oil and the like. Water is a preferred carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch glucose lactose sucrose gelatin malt rice flour chalk silica gel sodium stearate glycerol monostearate talc sodium chloride dried skim milk glycerol propylene glycol water ethanol and the like. The composition if desired can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents or pH buffering agents. These compositions can take the form of solutions suspensions emulsion tablets pills capsules powders sustained release formulations and the like. The composition can be formulated as a suppository with traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides. Oral formulation can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol lactose starch magnesium stearate sodium saccharine cellulose magnesium carbonate etc. Examples of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences by E. W. Martin. Such compositions will contain a therapeutically effective amount of the compound preferably in purified form together with a suitable amount of carrier so as to provide the form for proper administration to the patient. The formulation should suit the mode of administration.

In a preferred embodiment the composition is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous administration to human beings. Typically compositions for intravenous administration are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary the composition may also include a solubilizing agent and a local anesthetic such as lignocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection. Generally the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form for example as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the composition is administered by injection an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.

The compounds of the invention can be formulated as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those formed with anions such as those derived from hydrochloric phosphoric acetic oxalic tartaric acids etc. and those formed with cations such as those derived from sodium potassium ammonium calcium ferric hydroxides isopropylamine triethylamine 2 ethylamino ethanol histidine procaine etc.

The amount of the compound of the invention which will be effective in the treatment inhibition and prevention of a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression and or activity of a polypeptide of the invention can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition in vitro assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration and the seriousness of the disease or disorder and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient s circumstances. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.

For antibodies the dosage administered to a patient is typically 0.1 mg kg to 100 mg kg of the patient s body weight. Preferably the dosage administered to a patient is between 0.1 mg kg and 20 mg kg of the patient s body weight more preferably 1 mg kg to 10 mg kg of the patient s body weight. Generally human antibodies have a longer half life within the human body than antibodies from other species due to the immune response to the foreign polypeptides. Thus lower dosages of human antibodies and less frequent administration is often possible. Further the dosage and frequency of administration of antibodies of the invention may be reduced by enhancing uptake and tissue penetration e.g. into the brain of the antibodies by modifications such as for example lipidation.

The invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Optionally associated with such container s can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture use or sale for human administration. Diagnosis and Imaging

Labeled antibodies and derivatives and analogs thereof which specifically bind to a polypeptide of interest can be used for diagnostic purposes to detect diagnose or monitor diseases and or disorders associated with the aberrant expression and or activity of a polypeptide of the invention. The invention provides for the detection of aberrant expression of a polypeptide of interest comprising a assaying the expression of the polypeptide of interest in cells or body fluid of an individual using one or more antibodies specific to the polypeptide interest and b comparing the level of gene expression with a standard gene expression level whereby an increase or decrease in the assayed polypeptide gene expression level compared to the standard expression level is indicative of aberrant expression.

The invention provides a diagnostic assay for diagnosing a disorder comprising a assaying the expression of the polypeptide of interest in cells or body fluid of an individual using one or more antibodies specific to the polypeptide interest and b comparing the level of gene expression with a standard gene expression level whereby an increase or decrease in the assayed polypeptide gene expression level compared to the standard expression level is indicative of a particular disorder. With respect to cancer the presence of a relatively high amount of transcript in biopsied tissue from an individual may indicate a predisposition for the development of the disease or may provide a means for detecting the disease prior to the appearance of actual clinical symptoms. A more definitive diagnosis of this type may allow health professionals to employ preventative measures or aggressive treatment earlier thereby preventing the development or further progression of the cancer.

Antibodies of the invention can be used to assay protein levels in a biological sample using classical immunohistological methods known to those of skill in the art e.g. see Jalkanen et al. J. Cell. Biol. 101 976 985 1985 Jalkanen et al. J. Cell. Biol. 105 3087 3096 1987 . Other antibody based methods useful for detecting protein gene expression include immunoassays such as the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA and the radioimmunoassay RIA . Suitable antibody assay labels are known in the art and include enzyme labels such as glucose oxidase radioisotopes such as radioisotopes such as iodine I I I I carbon C sulfur S tritium H indium In In In In and technetium Tc Tc thallium Ti gallium Ga Ga palladium Pd molybdenum Mo xenon Xe fluorine F Sm Lu Gd Pm La Yb Ho Y Sc Re Re Pr Rh Ru luminescent labels such as luminol and fluorescent labels such as fluorescein and rhodamine and biotin.

One aspect of the invention is the detection and diagnosis of a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression of a polypeptide of interest in an animal preferably a mammal and most preferably a human. In one embodiment diagnosis comprises a administering for example parenterally subcutaneously or intraperitoneally to a subject an effective amount of a labeled molecule which specifically binds to the polypeptide of interest b waiting for a time interval following the administering for permitting the labeled molecule to preferentially concentrate at sites in the subject where the polypeptide is expressed and for unbound labeled molecule to be cleared to background level c determining background level and d detecting the labeled molecule in the subject such that detection of labeled molecule above the background level indicates that the subject has a particular disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression of the polypeptide of interest. Background level can be determined by various methods including comparing the amount of labeled molecule detected to a standard value previously determined for a particular system.

It will be understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging system used will determine the quantity of imaging moiety needed to produce diagnostic images. In the case of a radioisotope moiety for a human subject the quantity of radioactivity injected will normally range from about 5 to 20 millicuries of 99 mTc. The labeled antibody or antibody fragment will then preferentially accumulate at the location of cells which contain the specific protein. In vivo tumor imaging is described in S. W. Burchiel et al. Immunopharmacokinetics of Radiolabeled Antibodies and Their Fragments. Chapter 13 in Tumor Imaging The Radiochemical Detection of Cancer S. W. Burchiel and B. A. Rhodes eds. Masson Publishing Inc. 1982 .

Depending on several variables including the type of label used and the mode of administration the time interval following the administration for permitting the labeled molecule to preferentially concentrate at sites in the subject and for unbound labeled molecule to be cleared to background level is 6 to 48 hours or 6 to 24 hours or 6 to 12 hours. In another embodiment the time interval following administration is 5 to 20 days or 5 to 10 days.

In an embodiment monitoring of the disease or disorder is carried out by repeating the method for diagnosing the disease or disease for example one month after initial diagnosis six months after initial diagnosis one year after initial diagnosis etc.

Presence of the labeled molecule can be detected in the patient using methods known in the art for in vivo scanning. These methods depend upon the type of label used. Skilled artisans will be able to determine the appropriate method for detecting a particular label. Methods and devices that may be used in the diagnostic methods of the invention include but are not limited to computed tomography CT whole body scan such as position emission tomography PET magnetic resonance imaging MRI and sonography.

In a specific embodiment the molecule is labeled with a radioisotope and is detected in the patient using a radiation responsive surgical instrument Thurston et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 441 050 . In another embodiment the molecule is labeled with a fluorescent compound and is detected in the patient using a fluorescence responsive scanning instrument. In another embodiment the molecule is labeled with a positron emitting metal and is detected in the patent using positron emission tomography. In yet another embodiment the molecule is labeled with a paramagnetic label and is detected in a patient using magnetic resonance imaging MRI .

The present invention provides kits that can be used in the above methods. In one embodiment a kit comprises an antibody of the invention preferably a purified antibody in one or more containers. In a specific embodiment the kits of the present invention contain a substantially isolated polypeptide comprising an epitope which is specifically immunoreactive with an antibody included in the kit. Preferably the kits of the present invention further comprise a control antibody which does not react with the polypeptide of interest. In another specific embodiment the kits of the present invention contain a means for detecting the binding of an antibody to a polypeptide of interest e.g. the antibody may be conjugated to a detectable substrate such as a fluorescent compound an enzymatic substrate a radioactive compound or a luminescent compound or a second antibody which recognizes the first antibody may be conjugated to a detectable substrate .

In another specific embodiment of the present invention the kit is a diagnostic kit for use in screening serum containing antibodies specific against proliferative and or cancerous polynucleotides and polypeptides. Such a kit may include a control antibody that does not react with the polypeptide of interest. Such a kit may include a substantially isolated polypeptide antigen comprising an epitope which is specifically immunoreactive with at least one anti polypeptide antigen antibody. Further such a kit includes means for detecting the binding of said antibody to the antigen e.g. the antibody may be conjugated to a fluorescent compound such as fluorescein or rhodamine which can be detected by flow cytometry . In specific embodiments the kit may include a recombinantly produced or chemically synthesized polypeptide antigen. The polypeptide antigen of the kit may also be attached to a solid support.

In a more specific embodiment the detecting means of the above described kit includes a solid support to which said polypeptide antigen is attached. Such a kit may also include a non attached reporter labeled anti human antibody. In this embodiment binding of the antibody to the polypeptide antigen can be detected by binding of the said reporter labeled antibody.

In an additional embodiment the invention includes a diagnostic kit for use in screening serum containing antigens of the polypeptide of the invention. The diagnostic kit includes a substantially isolated antibody specifically immunoreactive with polypeptide or polynucleotide antigens and means for detecting the binding of the polynucleotide or polypeptide antigen to the antibody. In one embodiment the antibody is attached to a solid support. In a specific embodiment the antibody may be a monoclonal antibody. The detecting means of the kit may include a second labeled monoclonal antibody. Alternatively or in addition the detecting means may include a labeled competing antigen.

In one diagnostic configuration test serum is reacted with a solid phase reagent having a surface bound antigen obtained by the methods of the present invention. After binding with specific antigen antibody to the reagent and removing unbound serum components by washing the reagent is reacted with reporter labeled anti human antibody to bind reporter to the reagent in proportion to the amount of bound anti antigen antibody on the solid support. The reagent is again washed to remove unbound labeled antibody and the amount of reporter associated with the reagent is determined. Typically the reporter is an enzyme which is detected by incubating the solid phase in the presence of a suitable fluorometric luminescent or colorimetric substrate SIGMA St. Louis Mo. .

The solid surface reagent in the above assay is prepared by known techniques for attaching protein material to solid support material such as polymeric beads dip sticks 96 well plate or filter material. These attachment methods generally include non specific adsorption of the protein to the support or covalent attachment of the protein typically through a free amine group to a chemically reactive group on the solid support such as an activated carboxyl hydroxyl or aldehyde group. Alternatively streptavidin coated plates can be used in conjunction with biotinylated antigen s .

Thus the invention provides an assay system or kit for carrying out this diagnostic method. The kit generally includes a support with surface bound recombinant antigens and a reporter labeled anti human antibody for detecting surface bound anti antigen antibody.

TR17 is expressed in spleen small intestine thymus and peripheral blood lymphocytes. For a number of immune system related disorders substantially altered increased or decreased levels of TR17 gene expression can be detected in immune system tissue or other cells or bodily fluids e.g. sera plasma urine synovial fluid or spinal fluid taken from an individual having such a disorder relative to a standard TR17 gene expression level that is the TR17 expression level in immune system tissues or bodily fluids from an individual not having the immune system disorder. Thus the invention provides a diagnostic method useful during diagnosis of an immune system disorder which involves measuring the expression level of the gene encoding the TR17 polypeptide in immune system tissue or other cells or body fluid from an individual and comparing the measured gene expression level with a standard TR17 gene expression level whereby an increase or decrease in the gene expression level compared to the standard is indicative of an immune system disorder or normal activation proliferation differentiation and or death.

In particular it is believed that certain tissues in mammals with cancer of cells or tissue of the immune system express significantly enhanced or reduced levels of the TR17 polypeptide and mRNA encoding the TR17 polypeptide when compared to a corresponding standard level. Further it is believed that enhanced or depressed levels of the TR17 polypeptide can be detected in certain body fluids e.g. sera plasma urine and spinal fluid or cells or tissue from mammals with such a cancer when compared to sera from mammals of the same species not having the cancer.

For example as disclosed herein TR17 is highly expressed primarily in cells of B cell lineage. Accordingly polynucleotides of the invention e.g. polynucleotide sequences complementary to all or a portion of TR17 mRNA and antibodies and antibody fragments directed against the polypeptides of the invention may be used to quantitate or qualitate concentrations of cells of B cell lineage e.g. B cell leukemia and lymphoma cells expressing TR17 on their cell surfaces. These antibodies additionally have diagnostic applications in detecting abnormalities in the level of TR17 gene expression or abnormalities in the structure and or temporal tissue cellular or subcellular location of TR17. These diagnostic assays may be performed in vivo or in vitro such as for example on blood samples biopsy tissue or autopsy tissue.

Additionally as disclosed herein the TR17 ligand Neutrokine alpha is expressed primarily on cells of monocytic lineage. Accordingly TR17 polypeptides of the invention including labeled TR17 polypeptides and TR17 fusion proteins and anti TR17 antibodies including anti TR17 antibody fragments against the polypeptides of the invention may be used to quantitate or qualitate concentrations of cells of monocytic lineage e.g. monocyte cell lineage related leukemias or lymphomas expressing Neutrokine alpha on their cell surfaces. These TR17 polypeptides and antibodies additionally have diagnostic applications in detecting abnormalities in the level of Neutrokine alpha gene expression or abnormalities in the structure and or temporal tissue cellular or subcellular location of Neutrokine alpha and or diagnosing activity defects in signalling pathways associated with TR17. These diagnostic assays may be performed in vivo or in vitro such as for example on blood samples or biopsy tissue using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art.

In one embodiment TR17 polynucleotides or polypeptides or TR17 agonists e.g. anti TR17 antibodies or antagonists e.g. anti TR17 antibodies of the invention are used to treat prevent diagnose or prognose an individual having an immunodeficiency.

Immunodeficiencies that may be treated prevented diagnosed and or prognosed with the TR17 polynucleotides or polypeptides or TR17 agonists e.g. anti TR17 antibodies or antagonists e.g. anti TR17 antibodies of the invention include but are not limited to one or more immunodeficiencies selected from severe combined immunodeficiency SCID X linked SCID autosomal adenosine deaminase deficiency ADA deficiency X linked agammaglobulinemia XLA Bruton s disease congenital agammaglobulinemia X linked infantile agammaglobulinemia acquired agammaglobulinemia adult onset agammaglobulinemia late onset agammaglobulinemia dysgammaglobulinemia hypogammaglobulinemia transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy unspecified hypogammaglobulinemia agammaglobulinemia common variable immunodeficiency CVID acquired chronic granulomatous disease Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome WAS X linked immunodeficiency with hyper IgM non X linked immunodeficiency with hyper IgM selective IgA deficiency IgG subclass deficiency with or without IgA deficiency antibody deficiency with normal or elevated Igs immunodeficiency with thymoma Ig heavy chain deletions kappa chain deficiency B cell lymphoproliferative disorder BLPD selective IgM immunodeficiency recessive agammaglobulinemia Swiss type reticular dysgenesis neonatal neutropenia severe congenital leukopenia thymic alymphoplasia aplasia or dysplasia with immunodeficiency ataxia telangiectasia short limbed dwarfism X linked lymphoproliferative syndrome XLP Nezelof syndrome combined immunodeficiency with Igs purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency PNP MHC Class II deficiency Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome and severe combined immunodeficiency.

According to this embodiment an individual having an immunodeficiency expresses aberrantly low levels of TR17 when compared to an individual not having an immunodeficiency. Any means described herein or otherwise known in the art may be applied to detect TR17 polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention e.g. FACS analysis or ELISA detection of TR17 polypeptides of the invention and hybridization or PCR detection of TR17 polynucleotides of the invention and to determine the expression profile of TR17 polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention in a biological sample.

A biological sample of a person afflicted with an immunodeficiency is characterized by low levels of expression of TR17 when compared to that observed in individuals not having an immunodeficiency. Thus TR17 polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention and or agonists or antagonists thereof may be used according to the methods of the invention in the diagnosis and or prognosis of an immunodeficiency. For example a biological sample obtained from a person suspected of being afflicted with an immunodeficiency the subject may be analyzed for the relative expression level s of TR17 polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention. The expression level s of one or more of these molecules of the invention is are then compared to the expression level s of the same molecules of the invention as expressed in a person known not to be afflicted with an immunodeficiency. A significant difference in expression level s of TR17 polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention and or agonists and or antagonists thereof between samples obtained from the subject and the control suggests that the subject is afflicted with an immunodeficiency.

In another embodiment TR17 polynucleotides or polypeptides or TR17 agonists e.g. anti TR17 antibodies or antagonists e.g. anti TR17 antibodies of the invention are used to treat diagnose and or prognose an individual having common variable immunodeficiency disease CVID also known as acquired agammaglobulinemia and acquired hypogammaglobulinemia or a subset of this disease. According to this embodiment an individual having CVID or a subset of individuals having CVID expresses aberrant levels of Neutrokine alpha APRIL and or TR17 on their B cells and or monocytes when compared to individuals not having CVID. Any means described herein or otherwise known in the art may be applied to detect TR17 polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention e.g. FACS analysis or ELISA detection of TR17 polypeptides of the invention and hybridization or PCR detection of TR17 polynucleotides of the invention and to determine differentially the expression profile of TR17 polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention in a sample containing at least monocyte cells or some component thereof e.g. RNA as compared to a sample containing at least B cells or a component thereof e.g. RNA . In the instance where a sample containing at least monocyte cells or some component thereof e.g. RNA is determined to reflect TR17 ligand e.g. Neutrokine alpha and or APRIL polynucleotide or polypeptide expression and a sample containing at least B cells or a component thereof e.g. RNA is determined to reflect less than normal levels of TR17 polynucleotide or polypeptide expression the samples may be correlated with the occurrence of CVID i.e. acquired agammaglobulinemia or acquired hypogammaglobulinemia .

A subset of persons afflicted with CVID are characterized by high levels of expression of both TR17 ligand e.g. Neutrokine alpha and or APRIL and TR17 in peripheral or circulating B cells when compared to that observed in individuals not having CVID. In contrast persons who are not afflicted with CVID are typically characterized by low levels of TR17 ligand e.g. Neutrokine alpha and or APRIL expression and high levels of TR17 expression in peripheral or circulating B cells. Thus TR17 polypeptides polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention and or agonists or antagonists thereof may be used according to the methods of the invention in the differential diagnosis of this subset of CVID. For example a sample of peripherial B cells obtained from a person suspected of being afflicted with CVID the subject may be analyzed for the relative expression level s of TR17 ligand e.g. Neutrokine alpha and or APRIL and or TR17 polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention. The expression level s of one or more of these molecules of the invention is are then compared to the expression level s of the same molecules of the invention as expressed in a person known not to be afflicted with CVID the control . A significant difference in expression level s of TR17 ligand e.g. Neutrokine alpha and or APRIL and or TR17 polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention and or agonists and or antagonists thereof between samples obtained from the subject and the control suggests that the subject is afflicted with this subset of CVID.

A biological sample of persons afflicted with an autoimmune disease or disorder is characterized by high levels of expression of TR17 when compared to that observed in individuals not having an autoimmune disease or disorder. Thus TR17 polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention and or agonists or antagonists thereof may be used according to the methods of the invention in the diagnosis and or prognosis of an autoimmune disease or disorder.

A biological sample of persons afflicted with systemic lupus erythematosus is characterized by high levels of expression of TR17 when compared to that observed in individuals not having systemic lupus erythematosus. Thus TR17 polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention and or agonists or antagonists thereof may be used according to the methods of the invention in the diagnosis and or prognosis of systemic lupus erythematosus or a subset of systemic lupus erythematosus. For example a biological sample obtained from a person suspected of being afflicted with systemic lupus erytheamatosus the subject may be analyzed for the relative expression level s of TR17 polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention. The expression level s of one or more of these molecules of the invention is are then compared to the expression level s of the same molecules of the invention as expressed in a person known not to be afflicted with systemic lupus erythematosus.

Furthermore there is a direct correlation between the severity of systemic lupus erythematosus or a subset of this disease and the concentration of TR17 polynucleotides RNA and or polypeptides of the invention. Thus TR17 polynucleotides RNA polypeptides and or agonists or antagonists of the invention may be used according to the methods of the invention in prognosis of the severity of systemic lupus erythematosus or a subset of systemic lupus erythematosus.

In another embodiment TR17 polynucleotides or polypeptides or TR17 agonists e.g. anti TR17 antibodies or antagonists e.g. anti TR17 antibodies of the invention are used to treat diagnose or prognose an individual having rheumatoid arthritis or a subset of this disease. According to this embodiment an individual having rheumatoid arthritis or a subset of individuals having rheumatoid arthritis expresses aberrantly high levels of TR17 when compared to an individual not having rheumatoid arthritis or this subset of rheumatoid arthritis. Any means described herein or otherwise known in the art may be applied to detect TR17 polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention e.g. FACS analysis or ELISA detection of TR17 polypeptides of the invention and hybridization or PCR detection of TR17 polynucleotides of the invention and to determine the expression profile of TR17 polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention in a biological sample.

A biological sample of persons afflicted with rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by high levels of expression of TR17 when compared to that observed in individuals not having rheumatoid arthritis. Thus TR17 polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention and or agonists or antagonists thereof may be used according to the methods of the invention in the diagnosis and or prognosis of rheumatoid arthritis or a subset of rheumatoid arthritis. For example a biological sample obtained from a person suspected of being afflicted with rheumatoid arthritis the subject may be analyzed for the relative expression level s of TR17 polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention. The expression level s of one or more of these molecules of the invention is are then compared to the expression level s of the same molecules of the invention as expressed in a person known not to be afflicted with rheumatoid arthritis. A significant difference in expression level s of TR17 polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention and or agonists and or antagonists thereof between samples obtained from the subject and the control suggests that the subject is afflicted with rheumatoid arthritis or a subset thereof.

Thus the invention provides a diagnostic method useful during diagnosis of a immune system disorder including cancers of this system and immunodeficiencies and or autoimmune diseases which involves measuring the expression level of the gene encoding the TR17 polypeptide in immune system tissue or other cells or body fluid from an individual and comparing the measured gene expression level with a standard TR17 gene expression level whereby an increase or decrease in the gene expression level compared to the standard is indicative of an immune system disorder.

Where a diagnosis of a disorder in the immune system including but not limited to diagnosis of a tumor diagnosis of an immunodeficiency and or diagnosis of an autoimmune disease has already been made according to conventional methods the present invention is useful as a prognostic indicator whereby patients exhibiting enhanced or depressed TR17 gene expression will experience a worse clinical outcome relative to patients expressing the gene at a level nearer the standard level.

By analyzing or determining the expression level of the gene encoding the TR17 polypeptide is intended qualitatively or quantitatively measuring or estimating the level of the TR17 polypeptide or the level of the mRNA encoding the TR17 polypeptide in a first biological sample either directly e.g. by determining or estimating absolute protein level or mRNA level or relatively e.g. by comparing to the TR17 polypeptide level or mRNA level in a second biological sample . Preferably the TR17 polypeptide level or mRNA level in the first biological sample is measured or estimated and compared to a standard TR17 polypeptide level or mRNA level the standard being taken from a second biological sample obtained from an individual not having the disorder or being determined by averaging levels from a population of individuals not having a disorder of the immune system. As will be appreciated in the art once a standard TR17 polypeptide level or mRNA level is known it can be used repeatedly as a standard for comparison.

By biological sample is intended any biological sample obtained from an individual body fluid cell line tissue culture or other source which contains TR17 polypeptide or mRNA. As indicated biological samples include body fluids such as sera plasma urine synovial fluid and spinal fluid which contain free extracellular domains of the TR17 polypeptide immune system tissue and other tissue sources found to express complete or free extracellular domain of the TR17. Methods for obtaining tissue biopsies and body fluids from mammals are well known in the art. Where the biological sample is to include mRNA a tissue biopsy is the preferred source.

The compounds of the present invention are useful for diagnosis prognosis or treatment of various immune system related disorders in mammals preferably humans. Such disorders include but are not limited to tumors e.g. B cell and monocytic cell leukemias and lymphomas and tumor metastasis infections by bacteria viruses and other parasites immunodeficiencies inflammatory diseases lymphadenopathy autoimmune diseases e.g. rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythamatosus Sjogren syndrome mixed connective tissue disease and inflammatory myopathies and graft versus host disease.

Total cellular RNA can be isolated from a biological sample using any suitable technique such as the single step guanidinium thiocyanate phenol chloroform method described in Chomczynski and Sacchi 162 156 159 1987 . Levels of mRNA encoding the TR17 polypeptide are then assayed using any appropriate method. These include Northern blot analysis S1 nuclease mapping the polymerase chain reaction PCR reverse transcription in combination with the polymerase chain reaction RT PCR and reverse transcription in combination with the ligase chain reaction RT LCR .

Assaying TR17 polypeptide levels in a biological sample can occur using antibody based techniques. For example TR17 polypeptide expression in tissues can be studied with classical immunohistological methods Jalkanen M. et al. 101 976 985 1985 Jalkanen M. et al. 105 3087 3096 1987 . Other antibody based methods useful for detecting TR17 polypeptide gene expression include immunoassays such as the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA and the radioimmunoassay RIA . Suitable antibody assay labels are known in the art and include enzyme labels such as glucose oxidase and radioisotopes such as iodine I I I I carbon C sulfur S tritium H indium In In In In and technetium Tc Tc thallium Ti gallium Ga Ga palladium Pd molybdenum Mo xenon Xe fluorine F Sm Lu Gd Pm La Yb Ho Y Sc Re Re Pr Rh Ru luminescent labels such as luminol and fluorescent labels such as fluorescein and rhodamine and biotin.

Techniques known in the art may be applied to label antibodies of the invention. Such techniques include but are not limited to the use of bifunctional conjugating agents see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 756 065 5 714 631 5 696 239 5 652 361 5 505 931 5 489 425 5 435 990 5 428 139 5 342 604 5 274 119 4 994 560 and 5 808 003 the contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety .

The tissue or cell type to be analyzed will generally include those which are known or suspected to express the TR17 such as for example cells of B cell lineage and the spleen . The protein isolation methods employed herein may for example be such as those described in Harlow and Lane Harlow E. and Lane D. 1988 Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The isolated cells can be derived from cell culture or from a patient. The analysis of cells taken from culture may be a necessary step in the assessment of cells that could be used as part of a cell based gene therapy technique or alternatively to test the effect of compounds on the expression of the TR17 gene.

For example antibodies or fragments of antibodies such as those described herein may be used to quantitatively or qualitatively detect the presence of TR17 gene products or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof. This can be accomplished for example by immunofluorescence techniques employing a fluorescently labeled antibody coupled with light microscopic flow cytometric or fluorimetric detection.

The antibodies or fragments thereof or TR17 polypeptides or polypeptides of the present invention may additionally be employed histologically as in immunofluorescence immunoelectron microscopy or non immunological assays for in situ detection of TR17 gene products or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof or for TR17 ligand e.g. Neutrokine alpha binding to TR17. In situ detection may be accomplished by removing a histological specimen from a patient and applying thereto a labeled antibody or TR17 polypeptide of the present invention. The antibody or fragment or TR17 polypeptide is preferably applied by overlaying the labeled antibody or fragment onto a biological sample. Through the use of such a procedure it is possible to determine not only the presence of the TR17 gene product or conserved variants or peptide fragments or TR17 polypeptide binding but also its distribution in the examined tissue. Using the present invention those of ordinary skill will readily perceive that any of a wide variety of histological methods such as staining procedures can be modified in order to achieve such in situ detection.

Immunoassays and non immunoassays for TR17 gene products or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof will typically comprise incubating a sample such as a biological fluid a tissue extract freshly harvested cells or lysates of cells which have been incubated in cell culture in the presence of a detectably labeled antibody capable of identifying TR17 gene products or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof and detecting the bound antibody by any of a number of techniques well known in the art.

The biological sample may be brought in contact with and immobilized onto a solid phase support or carrier such as nitrocellulose or other solid support which is capable of immobilizing cells cell particles or soluble proteins. The support may then be washed with suitable buffers followed by treatment with the detectably labeled anti TR17 antibody or detectable TR17 polypeptide. The solid phase support may then be washed with the buffer a second time to remove unbound antibody or polypeptide. Optionally the antibody is subsequently labeled. The amount of bound label on solid support may then be detected by conventional means.

By solid phase support or carrier is intended any support capable of binding an antigen or an antibody. Well known supports or carriers include glass polystyrene polypropylene polyethylene dextran nylon amylases natural and modified celluloses polyacrylamides gabbros and magnetite. The nature of the carrier can be either soluble to some extent or insoluble for the purposes of the present invention. The support material may have virtually any possible structural configuration so long as the coupled molecule is capable of binding to an antigen or antibody. Thus the support configuration may be spherical as in a bead or cylindrical as in the inside surface of a test tube or the external surface of a rod. Alternatively the surface may be flat such as a sheet test strip etc. Preferred supports include polystyrene beads. Those skilled in the art will know many other suitable carriers for binding antibody or antigen or will be able to ascertain the same by use of routine experimentation.

The binding activity of a given lot of anti TR17 antibody or TR17 polypeptide may be determined according to well known methods. Those skilled in the art will be able to determine operative and optimal assay conditions for each determination by employing routine experimentation.

In addition to assaying TR17 polypeptide levels or polynucleotide levels in a biological sample obtained from an individual TR17 polypeptides or polynucleotides can also be detected in vivo by imaging. For example in one embodiment of the invention TR17 polypeptide and or anti TR17 antibody is used to image B cell lymphomas. In another embodiment TR17 polypeptides and or anti TR17 antibodies and or TR17 polynucleotides of the invention e.g. polynucleotides complementary to all or a portion of TR17 mRNA is used to image lymphomas e.g. monocyte and B cell lymphomas .

Antibody labels or markers for in vivo imaging of TR17 polypeptide include those detectable by X radiography NMR MRI CAT scans or ESR. For X radiography suitable labels include radioisotopes such as barium or cesium which emit detectable radiation but are not overtly harmful to the subject. Suitable markers for NMR and ESR include those with a detectable characteristic spin such as deuterium which may be incorporated into the antibody by labeling of nutrients for the relevant hybridoma. Where in vivo imaging is used to detect enhanced levels of TR17 polypeptide for diagnosis in humans it may be preferable to use human antibodies or humanized chimeric monoclonal antibodies. Such antibodies can be produced using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art. For example methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. See for review Morrison 229 1202 1985 Oi et al. 4 214 1986 Cabilly et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 Taniguchi et al. EP 171496 Morrison et al. EP 173494 Neuberger et al. WO 8601533 Robinson et al. WO 8702671 Boulianne et al. 312 643 1984 Neuberger et al. 314 268 1985 .

Additionally any TR17 polypeptide whose presence can be detected can be administered. For example TR17 polypeptides labeled with a radio opaque or other appropriate compound can be administered and visualized in vivo as discussed above for labeled antibodies. Further such TR17 polypeptides can be utilized for in vitro diagnostic procedures.

A TR17 polypeptide specific antibody or antibody fragment which has been labeled with an appropriate detectable imaging moiety such as a radioisotope for example I in mTc I I I I carbon C sulfur S tritium H indium In In In In and technetium Tc Tc thallium Ti gallium Ga Ga palladium Pd molybdenum Mo xenon Xe fluorine F Sm Lu Gd Pm La Yb Ho Y Sc Re Re Pr Rh Ru a radio opaque substance or a material detectable by nuclear magnetic resonance is introduced for example parenterally subcutaneously or intraperitoneally into the mammal to be examined for immune system disorder. It will be understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging system used will determine the quantity of imaging moiety needed to produce diagnostic images. In the case of a radioisotope moiety for a human subject the quantity of radioactivity injected will normally range from about 5 to 20 millicuries of Tc. The labeled antibody or antibody fragment will then preferentially accumulate at the location of cells which contain TR17 protein. In vivo tumor imaging is described in S. W. Burchiel et al. Immunopharmacokinetics of Radiolabeled Antibodies and Their Fragments Chapter 13 in S. W. Burchiel and B. A. Rhodes eds. Masson Publishing Inc. 1982 .

With respect to antibodies one of the ways in which the anti TR17 antibody can be detectably labeled is by linking the same to an enzyme and using the linked product in an enzyme immunoassay EIA Voller A. The Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay ELISA 1978 Diagnostic Horizons 2 1 7 Microbiological Associates Quarterly Publication Walkersville Md. Voller et al. 31 507 520 1978 Butler J. E. 73 482 523 1981 Maggio E. ed. 1980 Enzyme Immunoassay CRC Press Boca Raton Fla. Ishikawa E. et al. eds. 1981 Enzyme Immunoassay Kgaku Shoin Tokyo . The enzyme which is bound to the antibody will react with an appropriate substrate preferably a chromogenic substrate in such a manner as to produce a chemical moiety which can be detected for example by spectrophotometric fluorimetric or by visual means. Enzymes which can be used to detectably label the antibody include but are not limited to malate dehydrogenase staphylococcal nuclease delta 5 steroid isomerase yeast alcohol dehydrogenase alpha glycerophosphate dehydrogenase triose phosphate isomerase horseradish peroxidase alkaline phosphatase asparaginase glucose oxidase beta galactosidase ribonuclease urease catalase glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase glucoamylase and acetylcholinesterase. Additionally the detection can be accomplished by colorimetric methods which employ a chromogenic substrate for the enzyme. Detection may also be accomplished by visual comparison of the extent of enzymatic reaction of a substrate in comparison with similarly prepared standards.

Detection may also be accomplished using any of a variety of other immunoassays. For example by radioactively labeling the antibodies or antibody fragments it is possible to detect TR17 through the use of a radioimmunoassay RIA see for example Weintraub B. Principles of Radioimmunoassays Seventh Training Course on Radioligand Assay Techniques The Endocrine Society March 1986 which is incorporated by reference herein . The radioactive isotope can be detected by means including but not limited to a gamma counter a scintillation counter or autoradiography.

It is also possible to label the antibody with a fluorescent compound. When the fluorescently labeled antibody is exposed to light of the proper wave length its presence can then be detected due to fluorescence. Among the most commonly used fluorescent labeling compounds are fluorescein isothiocyanate rhodamine phycoerythrin phycocyanin allophycocyanin ophthaldehyde and fluorescamine.

The antibody can also be detectably labeled using fluorescence emitting metals such as Eu or others of the lanthanide series. These metals can be attached to the antibody using such metal chelating groups as diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid DTPA or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA .

The antibody also can be detectably labeled by coupling it to a chemiluminescent compound. The presence of the chemiluminescent tagged antibody is then determined by detecting the presence of luminescence that arises during the course of a chemical reaction. Examples of particularly useful chemiluminescent labeling compounds are luminol isoluminol theromatic acridinium ester imidazole acridinium salt and oxalate ester.

Likewise a bioluminescent compound may be used to label the antibody of the present invention. Bioluminescence is a type of chemiluminescence found in biological systems in which a catalytic protein increases the efficiency of the chemiluminescent reaction. The presence of a bioluminescent protein is determined by detecting the presence of luminescence. Important bioluminescent compounds for purposes of labeling include but are not limited to luciferin luciferase and aequorin.

As noted above TR17 polynucleotides and polypeptides and anti TR17 antibodies are useful for diagnosis of conditions involving abnormally high or low expression of TR17 activities. Given the cells and tissues where TR17 is expressed as well as the activities modulated by TR17 it is readily apparent that a substantially altered increased or decreased level of expression of TR17 in an individual compared to the standard or normal level produces pathological conditions related to the bodily system s in which TR17 is expressed and or is active.

It will also be appreciated by one of ordinary skill that since the TR17 polypeptides of the invention are members of the TNFR family the extracellular domains of the respective proteins may be released in soluble form from the cells which express TR17 by proteolytic cleavage and therefore when TR17 polypeptide particularly a soluble form of the respective extracellular domains is added from an exogenous source to cells tissues or the body of an individual the polypeptide may inhibit the modulating activities of it s ligands e.g. Neutrokine alpha and or APRIL on any of its target cells of that individual. Also cells expressing this type III transmembrane protein may be added to cells tissues or the body of an individual whereby the added cells will bind to cells expressing the TR17 ligands e.g. Neutrokine alpha and or APRIL whereby the cells expressing the TR17 ligand e.g. Neutrokine alpha and or APRIL can cause actions e.g. proliferation or cytotoxicity on the ligand bearing target cells.

The present invention is further directed to TR 17 based therapies which involve administering TR 17 based therapeutic compounds of the invention to an animal preferably a mammal and most preferably a human patient for treating one or more of the diseases disorders or conditions disclosed herein. Therapeutic compounds of the invention include but are not limited to TR17 polypeptides including fragments and variants of TR17 polypeptides polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides and antibodies that bind these polypeptides.

The treatment and or prevention of diseases disorders or conditions associated with aberrant expression and or activity of Neutrokine alpha APRIL BCMA and or TR17 includes but is not limited to alleviating symptoms associated with those diseases disorders or conditions. TR17 compositions of the invention may be provided in pharmaceutically acceptable compositions as known in the art or as described herein.

The TR17 polypeptides polynucleotides and antibodies of the invention that function as agonists or antagonists of Neutrokine alpha and or APRIL preferably of Neutrokine alpha induced signal transduction and or APRIL induced signal transduction can be administered to an animal to treat prevent or ameliorate a disease or disorder associated with aberrant Neutrokine alpha expression aberrant APRIL expression lack of Neutrokine alpha function lack of APRIL function aberrant TR17 expression aberrant BCMA expression lack of TR17 function and or lack of BCMA function. For example TR17 polypeptides of the invention which disrupt the interaction between TR17 and one or more of its ligands may be administered to an animal to treat prevent or ameliorate a disease or disorder associated with aberrant Neutrokine alpha expression aberrant APRIL expression excessive Neutrokine alpha function excessive APRIL function aberrant TR17 expression aberrant BCMA expression excessive TR17 function or excessive BCMA function.

Investigation of Neutrokine alpha induced signaling in human tonsillar B cells co stimulated with Cowan consistently revealed that mRNA for ERK 1 and PLK were upregulated by Neutrokine alpha SAC treatment data not shown . Polo like kinases PLK belong to a sub family of serine threonine kinases related to cell cycle protein CDC5. The expression of PLK is induced during G2 and S phase of the cell cycle. PLK is reported to play a role in cell proliferation Lee et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 95 9301 9306 . The role or extracellular signal related kinases ERK1 2 in cell survival and proliferative effects of growth factors and other agonists has been extensively studied. The induced expression of PLK and ERK 1 is consistent with the survival and proliferative effects of Neutrokine alpha on B cells.

Additionally in some samples of human tonsillar B cells stimulated with Neutrokine alpha and SAC mRNA for CD25 IL 2Ralpha was upregulated. Nuclear extracts from Human tonsillar B cells treated with Neutrokine alpha and from IM 9 cells treated with Neutrokine alpha were able to shift probes from the CD25 promoter region containing sites for NF kappaB SRF ELF 1 and HMGI Y in an electromobility shift assay. ELF 1 for example is a transcription factor that is part of the ETS family of proteins and whose expression appears to be restricted to T and B cells. Binding sites for ELF 1 have been described in the promoters of a number of proteins that are important in the regulation of the immune response.

Thus Neutrokine alpha induced signaling has been shown to be consistent with the activation of cellular activation and cellular proliferation pathways as well as with cellular signaling pathways that regulate B cell lifespan. Further Neutrokine alpha treatment of B cells induces cellular proliferation immunoglobulin secretion a characteristic of activated B cells Moore et al. Science 285 260 263 1999 . TR17 polypeptides complexed with Neutrokine alpha may inhibit stimulate or not significantly alter these Neutrokine alpha mediated activities.

B cell life span in vivo may be measured by 5 bromo 2 deoxyuridine BrdU labeling experiments which are well known to one skilled in the art. BrdU is a thymidine analogue that gets incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells. Cells containing BrdU in their DNA can be detected using for example fluorescently labeled anti BrdU antibody and flow cytometry. Briefly an animal is injected with BrdU in an amount sufficient to label developing B cells. Then a sample of B cells is withdrawn from the animal for example from peripheral blood and analyzed for the percentage of cells that contain BrdU. Such an analysis performed at several time points can be used to calculate the half life of B cells. Alternatively B cell survival may be measured in vitro. For example B cells may be cultured under conditions where proliferation does not occur for example the media should contain no reagents that crosslink the immunoglobulin receptor such as anti IgM antibodies for a period of time usually 2 4 days . At the end of this time the percent of surviving cells is determined using for instance the vital dye Trypan Blue or by staining cells with propidium iodide or any other agent designed to specifically stain apoptotic cells and analyzing the percentage of cells stained using flow cytometry.

Moreover in related embodiments this enhancement or antagonization of antigen presentation may be useful in anti tumor treatment or to modulate the immune system.

As a mediator of mucosal immune responses. The expression of TR17 ligand Neutrokine alpha on monocytes the expression of TR17 on B cells and the responsiveness of B cells to Neutrokine alpha suggests that it may be involved in exchange of signals between B cells and monocytes or their differentiated progeny. This activity is in many ways analogous to the CD40 CD154 signaling between B cells and T cells. TR17 may therefore be an important regulator of T cell independent immune responses to environmental pathogens. In particular the unconventional B cell populations CD5 that are associated with mucosal sites and responsible for much of the innate immunity in humans may respond to TR17 thereby enhancing an individual s protective immune status.

As an agent to direct an individual s immune system towards development of a humoral response i.e. TH2 as opposed to a TH1 cellular response.

As a means to induce tumor proliferation and thus make it more susceptible to anti neoplastic agents.

The agonists and antagonists may be employed in a composition with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier e.g. as described herein.

The antagonists may be employed for instance to inhibit TR17 mediated chemotaxis and activation of macrophages and their precursors and of neutrophils basophils B lymphocytes and some T cell subsets e.g. activated and CD8 cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells in certain auto immune and chronic inflammatory and infective diseases. Examples of auto immune diseases include multiple sclerosis and insulin dependent diabetes. The antagonists may also be employed to treat prevent and or diagnose infectious diseases including silicosis sarcoidosis idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis by preventing the recruitment and activation of mononuclear phagocytes. They may also be employed to treat prevent and or diagnose idiopathic hyper eosinophilic syndrome by preventing eosinophil production and migration. Endotoxic shock may also be treated by the antagonists by preventing the migration of macrophages and their production of the TR17 polypeptides of the present invention. The antagonists may also be employed for treating atherosclerosis by preventing monocyte infiltration in the artery wall. The antagonists may also be employed to treat prevent and or diagnose histamine mediated allergic reactions and immunological disorders including late phase allergic reactions chronic urticaria and atopic dermatitis by inhibiting chemokine induced mast cell and basophil degranulation and release of histamine. IgE mediated allergic reactions such as allergic asthma rhinitis and eczema may also be treated. The antagonists may also be employed to treat prevent and or diagnose chronic and acute inflammation by preventing the attraction of monocytes to a wound area. They may also be employed to regulate normal pulmonary macrophage populations since chronic and acute inflammatory pulmonary diseases are associated with sequestration of mononuclear phagocytes in the lung. Antagonists may also be employed to treat prevent and or diagnose rheumatoid arthritis by preventing the attraction of monocytes into synovial fluid in the joints of patients. Monocyte influx and activation plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of both degenerative and inflammatory arthropathies. The antagonists may be employed to interfere with the deleterious cascades attributed primarily to IL 1 and TNF which prevents the biosynthesis of other inflammatory cytokines. In this way the antagonists may be employed to prevent inflammation. The antagonists may also be employed to inhibit prostaglandin independent fever induced by TR17. The antagonists may also be employed to treat prevent and or diagnose cases of bone marrow failure for example aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. The antagonists may also be employed to treat prevent and or diagnose asthma and allergy by preventing eosinophil accumulation in the lung. The antagonists may also be employed to treat prevent and or diagnose subepithelial basement membrane fibrosis which is a prominent feature of the asthmatic lung.

TR17 polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention and or agonists and or antagonists thereof may be used to treat prevent and or diagnose various immune system related disorders and or conditions associated with these disorders in mammals preferably humans. Many autoimmune disorders result from inappropriate recognition of self as foreign material by immune cells. This inappropriate recognition results in an immune response leading to the destruction of the host tissue. Therefore the administration of TR17 polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention and or agonists and or antagonists thereof that can inhibit an immune response particularly the proliferation of B cells and or the production of immunoglobulins may be an effective therapy in treating and or preventing autoimmune disorders. Thus in preferred embodiments and or TR17 antagonists of the invention e.g. polypeptide fragments of TR17 and anti TR17 antibodies are used to treat prevent and or diagnose an autoimmune disorder.

The TNF family ligands are known to be among the most pleiotropic cytokines inducing a large number of cellular responses including cytotoxicity anti viral activity immunoregulatory activities and the transcriptional regulation of several genes D. V. Goeddel et al. Tumor Necrosis Factors Gene Structure and Biological Activities 51 597 609 1986 Cold Spring Harbor B. Beutler and A. Cerami 57 505 518 1988 L. J. Old 258 59 75 1988 W. Fiers 285 199 224 1991 . The TNF family ligands including the TR17 ligands e.g. Neutrokine alpha and or APRIL induce such various cellular responses by binding to TNF family receptors including TR17. Neutrokine alpha polypeptides and APRIL polypeptides are believed to elicit a potent cellular response including any genotypic phenotypic and or morphologic change to the cell cell line tissue tissue culture or patient. As indicated such cellular responses include not only normal physiological responses to TNF family ligands but also diseases associated with increased apoptosis or the inhibition of apoptosis. Apoptosis programmed cell death is a physiological mechanism involved in the deletion of peripheral B and or T lymphocytes of the immune system and its disregulation can lead to a number of different pathogenic processes J. C. Ameisen 8 1197 1213 1994 P. H. Krammer et al. 6 279 289 1994 .

Because TR17 belong to the TNFR superfamily the polypeptides should also modulate angiogenesis. In addition since TR17 inhibit immune cell functions the polypeptides will have a wide range of anti inflammatory activities. TR17 may be employed as an anti neovascularizing agent to treat prevent and or diagnose solid tumors by stimulating the invasion and activation of host defense cells e.g. cytotoxic T cells and macrophages and by inhibiting the angiogenesis of tumors. Those of skill in the art will recognize other non cancer indications where blood vessel proliferation is not wanted. They may also be employed to enhance host defenses against resistant chronic and acute infections for example myobacterial infections via the attraction and activation of microbicidal leukocytes. TR17 may also be employed to inhibit T cell proliferation by the inhibition of IL 2 biosynthesis for the treatment of T cell mediated auto immune diseases and lymphocytic leukemias including for example chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL . TR17 may also be employed to stimulate wound healing both via the recruitment of debris clearing and connective tissue promoting inflammatory cells. In this same manner TR17 may also be employed to treat prevent and or diagnose other fibrotic disorders including liver cirrhosis osteoarthritis and pulmonary fibrosis. TR17 also increases the presence of eosinophils that have the distinctive function of killing the larvae of parasites that invade tissues as in schistosomiasis trichinosis and . It may also be employed to regulate hematopoiesis by regulating the activation and differentiation of various hematopoietic progenitor cells for example to release mature leukocytes from the bone marrow following chemotherapy i.e. in stem cell mobilization. TR17 may also be employed to treat prevent and or diagnose sepsis.

Polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention and or agonists and or antagonists thereof are useful in promoting angiogenesis wound healing e.g. wounds burns and bone fractures . Polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention and or agonists and or antagonists thereof are also useful as an adjuvant to enhance immune responsiveness to specific antigen anti viral immune responses.

More generally polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention and or agonists and or antagonists thereof are useful in regulating i.e. elevating or reducing immune response. For example polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention may be useful in preparation or recovery from surgery trauma radiation therapy chemotherapy and transplantation or may be used to boost immune response and or recovery in the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Alternatively polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention and or agonists and or antagonists thereof are useful as immunosuppressive agents for example in the treatment or prevention of autoimmune disorders. In specific embodiments polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention are used to treat or prevent chronic inflammatory allergic or autoimmune conditions such as those described herein or are otherwise known in the art.

Preferably treatment using TR17 polynucleotides or polypeptides and or agonists or antagonists of TR17 e.g. anti TR17 antibody could either be by administering an effective amount of TR17 polypeptide of the invention or agonist or antagonist thereof to the patient or by removing cells from the patient supplying the cells with TR17 polynucleotide and returning the engineered cells to the patient ex vivo therapy . Moreover as further discussed herein the TR17 polypeptide or polynucleotide can be used as an adjuvant in a vaccine to raise an immune response against infectious disease.

The TR17 polypeptide composition preferably containing a polypeptide which is a soluble form of the TR17 extracellular domains will be formulated and dosed in a fashion consistent with good medical practice taking into account the clinical condition of the individual patient especially the side effects of treatment with TR17 polypeptide alone the site of delivery of the TR17 polypeptide composition the method of administration the scheduling of administration and other factors known to practitioners. The effective amount of TR17 polypeptide for purposes herein is thus determined by such considerations.

As a general proposition the total pharmaceutically effective amount of TR17 polypeptide administered parenterally per dose will be in the range of about 1 microgram kg day to 10 mg kg day of patient body weight although as noted above this will be subject to therapeutic discretion. More preferably this dose is at least 0.01 mg kg day and most preferably for humans between about 0.01 and 1 mg kg day.

In another embodiment the TR17 polypeptide of the invention is administered to a human at a dose between 0.0001 and 0.045 mg kg day preferably at a dose between 0.0045 and 0.045 mg kg day and more preferably at a dose of about 45 microgram kg day in humans and at a dose of about 3 mg kg day in mice.

If given continuously the TR17 polypeptide is typically administered at a dose rate of about 1 microgram kg hour to about 50 micrograms kg hour either by 1 4 injections per day or by continuous subcutaneous infusions for example using a mini pump. An intravenous bag solution may also be employed.

The length of treatment needed to observe changes and the interval following treatment for responses to occur appears to vary depending on the desired effect.

In a specific embodiment the total pharmaceutically effective amount of TR17 polypeptide administered parenterally per dose will be in the range of about 0.1 microgram kg day to 45 micrograms kg day of patient body weight although as noted above this will be subject to therapeutic discretion. More preferably this dose is at least 0.1 microgram kg day and most preferably for humans between about 0.01 and 50 micrograms kg day for the protein. N TR17 may be administered as a continuous infusion multiple dicreet injections per day e.g. three or more times daily or twice daily single injection per day or as discreet injections given intermitently e.g. twice daily once daily every other day twice weekly weekly biweekly monthly bimonthly and quarterly . If given continuously the TR17 polypeptide is typically administered at a dose rate of about 0.001 to 10 microgram kg hour to about 50 micrograms kg hour either by 1 4 injections per day or by continuous subcutaneous infusions for example using a mini pump.

Effective dosages of the compositions of the present invention to be administered may be determined through procedures well known to those in the art which address such parameters as biological half life bioavailability and toxicity. Such determination is well within the capability of those skilled in the art especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein.

Bioexposure of an organism to TR17 polypeptide during therapy may also play an important role in determining a therapeutically and or pharmacologically effective dosing regime. Variations of dosing such as repeated administrations of a relatively low dose of TR17 polypeptide for a relatively long period of time may have an effect which is therapeutically and or pharmacologically distinguishable from that achieved with repeated administrations of a relatively high dose of TR17 for a relatively short period of time.

Using the equivalent surface area dosage conversion factors supplied by Freireich E. J. et al. 50 4 219 44 1966 one of ordinary skill in the art is able to conveniently convert data obtained from the use of TR17 in a given experimental system into an accurate estimation of a pharmaceutically effective amount of TR17 polypeptide to be administered per dose in another experimental system. Experimental data obtained through the administration of TR17 in mice may converted through the conversion factors supplied by Freireich et al. to accurate estimates of pharmaceutically effective doses of TR17 in rat monkey dog and human. The following conversion table Table III is a summary of the data provided by Freireich et al. Table III gives approximate factors for converting doses expressed in terms of mg kg from one species to an equivalent surface area dose expressed as mg kg in another species tabulated.

Thus for example using the conversion factors provided in Table III a dose of 50 mg kg in the mouse converts to an appropriate dose of 12.5 mg kg in the monkey because 50 mg kg 1 4 12.5 mg kg. As an additional example doses of 0.02 0.08 0.8 2 and 8 mg kg in the mouse equate to effect doses of 1.667 micrograms kg 6.67 micrograms kg 66.7 micrograms kg 166.7 micrograms kg and 0.667 mg kg respectively in the human.

In yet an additional embodiment the compositions of the invention are delivered by way of a pump see Langer supra Sefton CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14 201 1987 Buchwald et al. Surgery 88 507 1980 Saudek et al. N. Engl. J. Med. 321 574 1989 .

For parenteral administration in one embodiment the TR17 polypeptide is formulated generally by mixing it at the desired degree of purity in a unit dosage injectable form solution suspension or emulsion with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier i.e. one that is non toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and is compatible with other ingredients of the formulation. For example the formulation preferably does not include oxidizing agents and other compounds that are known to be deleterious to polypeptides.

Generally the formulations are prepared by contacting the TR17 polypeptide uniformly and intimately with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both. Then if necessary the product is shaped into the desired formulation. Preferably the carrier is a parenteral carrier more preferably a solution that is isotonic with the blood of the recipient. Examples of such carrier vehicles include water saline Ringer s solution and dextrose solution. Non aqueous vehicles such as fixed oils and ethyl oleate are also useful herein as well as liposomes.

The carrier suitably contains minor amounts of additives such as substances that enhance isotonicity and chemical stability. Such materials are non toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and include buffers such as phosphate citrate succinate acetic acid and other organic acids or their salts antioxidants such as ascorbic acid low molecular weight less than about ten residues polypeptides e.g. polyarginine or tripeptides proteins such as serum albumin gelatin or immunoglobulins hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone amino acids such as glycine glutamic acid aspartic acid or arginine monosaccharides disaccharides and other carbohydrates including cellulose or its derivatives glucose manose sucrose or dextrins chelating agents such as EDTA sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol counterions such as sodium preservatives such as cresol phenol chlorobutanol benzyl alcohol and parabens and or nonionic surfactants such as polysorbates poloxamers or PEG.

The TR17 polypeptide is typically formulated in such vehicles at a concentration of about 0.001 mg ml to 100 mg ml or 0.1 mg ml to 100 mg ml preferably 1 10 mg ml or 1 10 mg ml at a pH of about 3 to 10 or 3 to 8 more preferably 5 8 most preferably 6 7. It will be understood that the use of certain of the foregoing excipients carriers or stabilizers will result in the formation of TR17 polypeptide salts.

TR17 polypeptide to be used for therapeutic administration must be sterile. Sterility is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes e.g. 0.2 micron membranes . Therapeutic TR17 polypeptide compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port for example an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.

TR17 polypeptide ordinarily will be stored in unit or multi dose containers for example sealed ampoules or vials as an aqueous solution or as a lyophilized formulation for reconstitution. As an example of a lyophilized formulation 10 ml vials are filled with 5 ml of sterile filtered 1 w v aqueous TR17 polypeptide solution and the resulting mixture is lyophilized. The infusion solution is prepared by reconstituting the lyophilized TR17 polypeptide using bacteriostatic Water for Injection.

Alternatively TR17 polypeptide is stored in single dose containers in lyophilized form. The infusion selection is reconstituted using a sterile carrier for injection.

The invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention.

The polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention and or agonists or antagonists thereof is administered to the patient by any suitable technique including but not limited to parenteral sublingual topical intrapulmonary and intranasal and those techniques further discussed herein. The pharmaceutical composition optionally contains one or more members of the group consisting of erythropoietin testosterone progenitor cell stimulators insulin like growth factor prostaglandins serotonin cyclic AMP prolactin triiodothyzonine methenolene stanozolol and nandrolone iron preparations vitamin B folic acid and or adrenocortical steroids.

In an additional embodiment the compositions of the invention are administered in combination with fibroblast growth factors. Fibroblast growth factors that may be administered with the compositions of the invention include but are not limited to FGF 1 FGF 2 FGF 3 FGF 4 FGF 5 FGF 6 FGF 7 FGF 8 FGF 9 FGF 10 FGF 11 FGF 12 FGF 13 FGF 14 and FGF 15.

Additionally the compositions of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with other therapeutic regimens including but not limited to radiation therapy. Such combinatorial therapy may be administered sequentially and or concomitantly.

The invention also provides a method of screening compounds to identify those which enhance or block the action of TR17 polypeptide on cells such as its interaction with TR17 binding molecules such as ligand molecules. An agonist is a compound which increases the natural biological functions of TR17 or which functions in a manner similar to TR17 while antagonists decrease or eliminate such functions.

In another embodiment the invention provides a method for identifying a ligand protein or other ligand binding protein which binds specifically to TR17 polypeptide. For example a cellular compartment such as a membrane or a preparation thereof may be prepared from a cell that expresses a molecule that binds TR17 ligand e.g. Neutrokine alpha and or APRIL . The preparation is incubated with labeled TR17 ligand and complexes of TR17 ligand bound to TR17 or other binding protein are isolated and characterized according to routine methods known in the art. Alternatively the TR17 ligand polypeptide may be bound to a solid support so that binding molecules solubilized from cells are bound to the column and then eluted and characterized according to routine methods.

In the assay of the invention for agonists or antagonists a cellular compartment such as a membrane or a preparation thereof may be prepared from a cell that expresses a molecule that binds TR17 such as a molecule of a signaling or regulatory pathway modulated by TR17. The preparation is incubated with labeled TR17 in the absence or the presence of a candidate molecule which may be a TR17 agonist or antagonist. The ability of the candidate molecule to bind the binding molecule is reflected in decreased binding of the labeled ligand. Molecules which bind gratuitously i.e. without inducing the effects of TR17 on binding the TR17 binding molecule are most likely to be good antagonists. Molecules that bind well and elicit effects that are the same as or closely related to TR17 are agonists.

TR17 like effects of potential agonists and antagonists may by measured for instance by determining activity of a second messenger system following interaction of the candidate molecule with a cell or appropriate cell preparation and comparing the effect with that of TR17 or molecules that elicit the same effects as TR17. Second messenger systems that may be useful in this regard include but are not limited to AMP guanylate cyclase ion channel or phosphoinositide hydrolysis second messenger systems.

Another example of an assay for TR17 antagonists is a competitive assay that combines TR17 and a potential antagonist with membrane bound ligand molecules or recombinant TR17 ligang molecules under appropriate conditions for a competitive inhibition assay. TR17 can be labeled such as by radioactivity such that the number of TR17 molecules bound to a ligand molecule can be determined accurately to assess the effectiveness of the potential antagonist.

Potential antagonists include small organic molecules peptides polypeptides e.g. IL 13 and antibodies that bind to a polypeptide of the invention and thereby inhibit or extinguish its activity. Potential antagonists also may be small organic molecules a peptide a polypeptide such as a closely related protein or antibody that binds the same sites on a binding molecule such as a ligand molecule without inducing TR17 induced activities thereby preventing the action of TR17 by excluding TR17 from binding.

Other potential antagonists include antisense molecules. Antisense technology can be used to control gene expression through antisense DNA or RNA or through triple helix formation. Antisense techniques are discussed for example in Okano J. Neurochem. 56 560 1991 Oligodeoxynucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression CRC Press Boca Raton Fla. 1988 . Antisense technology can be used to control gene expression through antisense DNA or RNA or through triple helix formation. Antisense techniques are discussed for example in Okano J. Neurochem. 56 560 1991 Oligodeoxynucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression CRC Press Boca Raton Fla. 1988 . Triple helix formation is discussed in for instance Lee et al. Nucleic Acids Research 6 3073 1979 Cooney et al. Science 241 456 1988 and Dervan et al. Science 251 1360 1991 . The methods are based on binding of a polynucleotide to a complementary DNA or RNA. For example the 5 coding portion of a polynucleotide that encodes the extracellular domain of the polypeptide of the present invention may be used to design an antisense RNA oligonucleotide of from about 10 to 40 base pairs in length. A DNA oligonucleotide is designed to be complementary to a region of the gene involved in transcription thereby preventing transcription and the production of TR17. The antisense RNA oligonucleotide hybridizes to the mRNA in vivo and blocks translation of the mRNA molecule into TR17 polypeptide. The oligonucleotides described above can also be delivered to cells such that the antisense RNA or DNA may be expressed in vivo to inhibit production of TR17.

In one embodiment the TR17 antisense nucleic acid of the invention is produced intracellularly by transcription from an exogenous sequence. For example a vector or a portion thereof is transcribed producing an antisense nucleic acid RNA of the invention. Such a vector would contain a sequence encoding the TR17 antisense nucleic acid. Such a vector can remain episomal or become chromosomally integrated as long as it can be transcribed to produce the desired antisense RNA. Such vectors can be constructed by recombinant DNA technology methods standard in the art. Vectors can be plasmid viral or others know in the art used for replication and expression in vertebrate cells. Expression of the sequence encoding TR17 or fragments thereof can be by any promoter known in the art to act in vertebrate preferably human cells. Such promoters can be inducible or constitutive. Such promoters include but are not limited to the SV40 early promoter region Bemoist and Chambon Nature 29 304 310 1981 the promoter contained in the 3 long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus Yamamoto et al. 22 787 797 1980 the herpes thymidine promoter Wagner et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78 1441 1445 1981 the regulatory sequences of the metallothionein gene Brinster et al. Nature 296 39 42 1982 etc.

The antisense nucleic acids of the invention comprise a sequence complementary to at least a portion of an RNA transcript of a TR17 gene. However absolute complementarity although preferred is not required. A sequence complementary to at least a portion of an RNA referred to herein means a sequence having sufficient complementarity to be able to hybridize with the RNA forming a stable duplex in the case of double stranded TR17 antisense nucleic acids a single strand of the duplex DNA may thus be tested or triplex formation may be assayed. The ability to hybridize will depend on both the degree of complementarity and the length of the antisense nucleic acid Generally the larger the hybridizing nucleic acid the more base mismatches with a TR17 RNA it may contain and still form a stable duplex or triplex as the case may be . One skilled in the art can ascertain a tolerable degree of mismatch by use of standard procedures to determine the melting point of the hybridized complex.

Oligonucleotides that are complementary to the 5 end of the message e.g. the 5 untranslated sequence up to and including the AUG initiation codon should work most efficiently at inhibiting translation. However sequences complementary to the 3 untranslated sequences of mRNAs have been shown to be effective at inhibiting translation of mRNAs as well. See generally Wagner R. 1994 Nature 372 333 335. Thus oligonucleotides complementary to either the 5 or 3 non translated non coding regions of TR17 shown in respectively could be used in an antisense approach to inhibit translation of endogenous TR17 mRNA. Oligonucleotides complementary to the 5 untranslated region of the mRNA should include the complement of the AUG start codon. Antisense oligonucleotides complementary to mRNA coding regions are less efficient inhibitors of translation but could be used in accordance with the invention. Whether designed to hybridize to the 5 3 or coding region of TR17 mRNA antisense nucleic acids should be at least six nucleotides in length and are preferably oligonucleotides ranging from 6 to about 50 nucleotides in length. In specific aspects the oligonucleotide is at least 10 nucleotides at least 17 nucleotides at least 25 nucleotides or at least 50 nucleotides.

The polynucleotides of the invention can be DNA or RNA or chimeric mixtures or derivatives or modified versions thereof single stranded or double stranded. The oligonucleotide can be modified at the base moiety sugar moiety or phosphate backbone for example to improve stability of the molecule hybridization etc. The oligonucleotide may include other appended groups such as peptides e.g. for targeting host cell receptors in vivo or agents facilitating transport across the cell membrane see e.g. Letsinger et al. 1989 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86 6553 6556 Lemaitre et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 84 648 652 1987 PCT Publication No. WO88 09810 published Dec. 15 1988 or the blood brain barrier see e.g. PCT Publication No. WO89 10134 published Apr. 25 1988 hybridization triggered cleavage agents. See e.g. Krol et al. BioTechniques 6 958 976 1988 or intercalating agents. See e.g. Zon Pharm. Res. 5 539 549 1988 . To this end the oligonucleotide may be conjugated to another molecule e.g. a peptide hybridization triggered cross linking agent transport agent hybridization triggered cleavage agent etc.

The antisense oligonucleotide may comprise at least one modified base moiety which is selected from the group including but not limited to 5 fluorouracil 5 bromouracil 5 chlorouracil 5 iodouracil hypoxanthine xantine 4 acetylcytosine 5 carboxyhydroxylmethyl uracil 5 carboxymethylaminomethyl 2 thiouridine 5 carboxymethylaminomethyluracil dihydrouracil beta D galactosylqueosine inosine N6 isopentenyladenine 1 methylguanine 1 methylinosine 2 2 dimethylguanine 2 methyladenine 2 methylguanine 3 methylcytosine 5 methylcytosine N6 adenine 7 methylguanine 5 methylaminomethyluracil 5 methoxyaminomethyl 2 thiouracil beta D mannosylqueosine 5 methoxycarboxymethyluracil 5 methoxyuracil 2 methylthio N 6 isopentenyladenine uracil 5 oxyacetic acid v wybutoxosine pseudouracil queosine 2 thiocytosine 5 methyl 2 thiouracil 2 thiouracil 4 thiouracil 5 methyluracil uracil 5 oxyacetic acid methylester uracil 5 oxyacetic acid v 5 methyl 2 thiouracil 3 3 amino 3 N2 carboxypropyl uracil acp3 w and 2 6 diaminopurine.

The antisense oligonucleotide may also comprise at least one modified sugar moiety selected from the group including but not limited to arabinose 2 fluoroarabinose xylulose and hexose.

In yet another embodiment the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified phosphate backbone selected from the group including but not limited to a phosphorothioate a phosphorodithioate a phosphoramidothioate a phosphoramidate a phosphordiamidate a methylphosphonate an alkyl phosphotriester and a formacetal or analog thereof.

In yet another embodiment the antisense oligonucleotide is an alpha anomeric oligonucleotide. An alpha anomeric oligonucleotide forms specific double stranded hybrids with complementary RNA in which contrary to the usual beta units the strands run parallel to each other Gautier et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 15 6625 6641 1987 . The oligonucleotide is a 2 0 methylribonucleotide Inoue et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 15 6131 6148 1987 or a chimeric RNA DNA analogue Inoue et al. FEBS Lett. 215 327 330 1997 .

Polynucleotides of the invention may be synthesized by standard methods known in the art e.g. by use of an automated DNA synthesizer such as are commercially available from Biosearch Applied Biosystems etc. . As examples phosphorothioate oligonucleotides may be synthesized by the method of Stein et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 16 3209 1988 methylphosphonate oligonucleotides can be prepared by use of controlled pore glass polymer supports Sarin et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85 7448 7451 1988 etc.

While antisense nucleotides complementary to the TR17 coding region sequence could be used those complementary to the transcribed untranslated region are most preferred.

Potential antagonists according to the invention also include catalytic RNA or a ribozyme See e.g. PCT International Publication WO 90 11364 published Oct. 4 1990 Sarver et al Science 247 1222 1225 1990 . While ribozymes that cleave mRNA at site specific recognition sequences can be used to destroy TR17 mRNAs the use of hammerhead ribozymes is preferred. Hammerhead ribozymes cleave mRNAs at locations dictated by flanking regions that form complementary base pairs with the target mRNA. The sole requirement is that the target mRNA have the following sequence of two bases 5 UG 3 . The construction and production of hammerhead ribozymes is well known in the art and is described more fully in Haseloff and Gerlach Nature 334 585 591 1988 . There are numerous potential hammerhead ribozyme cleavage sites within the nucleotide sequence of TR17 . Preferably the ribozyme is engineered so that the cleavage recognition site is located near the 5 end of the TR17 mRNA i.e. to increase efficiency and minimize the intracellular accumulation of non functional mRNA transcripts.

As in the antisense approach the ribozymes of the invention can be composed of modified oligonucleotides e.g. for improved stability targeting etc. and should be delivered to cells which express TR17 in vivo. DNA constructs encoding the ribozyme may be introduced into the cell in the same manner as described above for the introduction of antisense encoding DNA. A preferred method of delivery involves using a DNA construct encoding the ribozyme under the control of a strong constitutive promoter such as for example pol III or pol II promoter so that transfected cells will produce sufficient quantities of the ribozyme to destroy endogenous TR17 messages and inhibit translation. Since ribozymes unlike antisense molecules are catalytic a lower intracellular concentration is required for efficiency.

Endogenous gene expression can also be reduced by inactivating or knocking out the TR17 gene and or its promoter using targeted homologous recombination. E.g. see Smithies et al. Nature 317 230 234 1985 Thomas Capecchi Cell 51 503 512 1987 Thompson et al. Cell 5 313 321 1989 each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . For example a mutant non functional polynucleotide of the invention or a completely unrelated DNA sequence flanked by DNA homologous to the endogenous polynucleotide sequence either the coding regions or regulatory regions of the gene can be used with or without a selectable marker and or a negative selectable marker to transfect cells that express polypeptides of the invention in vivo. In another embodiment techniques known in the art are used to generate knockouts in cells that contain but do not express the gene of interest. Insertion of the DNA construct via targeted homologous recombination results in inactivation of the targeted gene. Such approaches are particularly suited in research and agricultural fields where modifications to embryonic stem cells can be used to generate animal offspring with an inactive targeted gene e.g. see Thomas Capecchi 1987 and Thompson 1989 supra . However this approach can be routinely adapted for use in humans provided the recombinant DNA constructs are directly administered or targeted to the required site in vivo using appropriate viral vectors that will be apparent to those of skill in the art. The contents of each of the documents recited in this paragraph is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

In other embodiments antagonists according to the present invention include soluble forms of TR17 e.g. fragments of TR17 shown in that include the ligand binding domain TNFR conserved domain and or extracellular domain of TR17 . Such soluble forms of the TR17 which may be naturally occurring or synthetic antagonize TR17 mediated signaling by competing with native TR17 for binding to TR17 ligand e.g. Neutrokine alpha International Publication No. WO 98 18921 and or APRIL International Publication Number WO 97 33902 J. Exp. Med. 188 6 1185 1190 and or by forming a multimer that may or may not be capable of binding the receptor but which is incapable of inducing signal transduction. Preferably these antagonists inhibit TR17 mediated stimulation of lymphocyte e.g. B cell proliferation differentiation and or activation. Antagonists of the present invention also include antibodies specific for TNFR family receptors and TR17 Fc fusion proteins.

By a TNF family ligand is intended naturally occurring recombinant and synthetic ligands that are capable of binding to a member of the TNF receptor family and inducing and or blocking the ligand receptor signaling pathway. Members of the TNF ligand family include but are not limited to TNF alpha lymphotoxin alpha LT alpha also known as TNF beta LT beta found in complex heterotrimer LT alpha2 beta FasL CD40L TNF gamma International Publication No. WO 96 14328 AIM I International Publication No. WO 97 33899 AIM II International Publication No. WO 97 34911 APRIL International Publication Number WO 97 33902 J. Exp. Med. 188 6 1185 1190 endokine alpha International Publication No. WO 98 07880 neutrokine alpha International Publication No. WO 98 18921 CD27L CD30L 4 1BBL OX40L CD27 CD30 4 1BB OX40 and nerve growth factor NGF . In specific embodiments the TNF family ligand is Neutrokine alpha or fragments or variants thereof. In other specific embodiments the TNF family ligand is APRIL or fragments or variants thereof.

Antagonists of the present invention also include antibodies specific for TNF family ligands e.g. Neutrokine alpha and APRIL or the TR17 polypeptides of the invention. Antibodies according to the present invention may be prepared by any of a variety of standard methods using TR17 immunogens of the present invention. As indicated such TR17 immunogens include the complete TR17 polypeptides depicted in SEQ ID NO 2 and TR17 polypeptide fragments comprising for example one or both of the cysteine rich domains extracellular domain transmembrane domain and or intracellular domain or any combination thereof.

Polyclonal and monoclonal antibody agonists or antagonists according to the present invention can be raised according to the methods disclosed in Tartaglia and Goeddel 267 7 4304 4307 1992 Tartaglia et al. 73 213 216 1993 and PCT Application WO 94 09137 and are preferably specific to i.e. bind uniquely to polypeptides of the invention having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 2. The term antibody Ab or monoclonal antibody mAb as used herein is meant to include intact molecules as well as fragments thereof such as for example Fab and F ab fragments which are capable of binding an antigen. Fab Fab and F ab fragments lack the Fc fragment intact antibody clear more rapidly from the circulation and may have less non specific tissue binding of an intact antibody Wahl et al. 24 316 325 1983 .

In a preferred method antibodies according to the present invention are mAbs. Such mAbs can be prepared using hybridoma technology Kohler and Millstein 256 495 497 1975 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 376 110 Harlow et al. A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. 1988 Plenum Press New York N.Y. 1980 Campbell Monoclonal Antibody Technology In Volume 13 Burdon et al. eds. Elsevier Amsterdam 1984 .

Proteins and other compounds which bind the TR17 domains are also candidate agonists and antagonists according to the present invention. Such binding compounds can be captured using the yeast two hybrid system Fields and Song 340 245 246 1989 . A modified version of the yeast two hybrid system has been described by Roger Brent and his colleagues Gyuris 75 791 803 1993 Zervos et al. 72 223 232 1993 . Preferably the yeast two hybrid system is used according to the present invention to capture compounds which bind to the extracellular domain intracellular transmembrane and one or both of the cysteine rich domains of the TR17. Such compounds are good candidate agonists and antagonists of the present invention.

For example using the two hybrid assay described above the extracellular or intracellular domain of the TR17 or a portion thereof e.g. one or both of the cysteine rich domains may be used to identify cellular proteins which interact with TR17 the receptor in vivo. Such an assay may also be used to identify ligands with potential agonistic or antagonistic activity of TR17 receptor function. This screening assay has previously been used to identify protein which interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the murine TNF R11 and led to the identification of two receptor associated proteins. Rothe et al. 78 681 1994 . Such proteins and amino acid sequences which bind to the cytoplasmic domain of the TR17 are good candidate agonist and antagonist of the present invention.

Other screening techniques include the use of cells which express the polypeptide of the present invention for example transfected CHO cells in a system which measures extracellular pH changes caused by receptor activation for example as described in 246 181 296 1989 . In another example potential agonists or antagonists may be contacted with a cell which expresses the polypeptide of the present invention and a second messenger response e.g. signal transduction may be measured to determine whether the potential antagonist or agonist is effective.

Agonists according to the present invention include naturally occurring and synthetic compounds such as for example TNF family ligand peptide fragments transforming growth factor neurotransmitters such as glutamate dopamine N methyl D aspartate tumor suppressors p53 cytolytic T cells and antimetabolites. Preferred agonists include chemotherapeutic drugs such as for example cisplatin doxorubicin bleomycin cytosine arabinoside nitrogen mustard methotrexate and vincristine. Others include ethanol and amyloid peptide. 267 1457 1458 1995 .

Preferred agonists are fragments of TR17 polypeptides of the invention which stimulate lymphocyte e.g. B cell proliferation differentiation and or activation. Further preferred agonists include polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies raised against the TR17 polypeptides of the invention or a fragment thereof. Such agonist antibodies raised against a TNF family receptor are disclosed in Tartaglia et al. 88 9292 9296 1991 and Tartaglia et al. 267 4304 4307 1992 . See also PCT Application WO 94 09137.

In an additional embodiment immunoregulatory molecules such as for example IL2 IL3 IL4 IL5 IL6 IL7 IL10 IL12 IL13 IL15 anti CD40 CD40L IFN gamma and TNF alpha may be used as agonists of TR17 polypeptides of the invention which stimulate lymphocyte e.g. B cell proliferation differentiation and or activation. In a specific embodiment IL4 and or IL10 are used to enhance the TR17 mediated proliferation of B cells.

In further embodiments of the invention cells that are genetically engineered to express the polypeptides of the invention or alternatively that are genetically engineered not to express the polypeptides of the invention e.g. knockouts are administered to a patient in vivo. Such cells may be obtained from the patient i.e. animal including human or an MHC compatible donor and can include but are not limited to fibroblasts bone marrow cells blood cells e.g. lymphocytes adipocytes muscle cells endothelial cells etc. The cells are genetically engineered in vitro using recombinant DNA techniques to introduce the coding sequence of polypeptides of the invention into the cells or alternatively to disrupt the coding sequence and or endogenous regulatory sequence associated with the polypeptides of the invention e.g. by transduction using viral vectors and preferably vectors that integrate the transgene into the cell genome or transfection procedures including but not limited to the use of plasmids cosmids YACs naked DNA electroporation liposomes etc. The coding sequence of the polypeptides of the invention can be placed under the control of a strong constitutive or inducible promoter or promoter enhancer to achieve expression and preferably secretion of the polypeptides of the invention. The engineered cells which express and preferably secrete the polypeptides of the invention can be introduced into the patient systemically e.g. in the circulation or intraperitoneally.

Alternatively the cells can be incorporated into a matrix and implanted in the body e.g. genetically engineered fibroblasts can be implanted as part of a skin graft genetically engineered endothelial cells can be implanted as part of a lymphatic or vascular graft. See for example Anderson et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 399 349 and Mulligan Wilson U.S. Pat. No. 5 460 959 each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety .

When the cells to be administered are non autologous or non MHC compatible cells they can be administered using well known techniques which prevent the development of a host immune response against the introduced cells. For example the cells may be introduced in an encapsulated form which while allowing for an exchange of components with the immediate extracellular environment does not allow the introduced cells to be recognized by the host immune system.

In yet another embodiment of the invention the activity of TR17 polypeptide can be reduced using a dominant negative. To this end constructs which encode defective TR17 polypeptide such as for example mutants lacking all or a portion of the TNF conserved domain can be used in gene therapy approaches to diminish the activity of TR17 on appropriate target cells. For example nucleotide sequences that direct host cell expression of TR17 polypeptide in which all or a portion of the TNFR conserved domain is altered or missing can be introduced into monocytic cells or other cells or tissues either by in vivo or ex vivo gene therapy methods described herein or otherwise known in the art . Alternatively targeted homologous recombination can be utilized to introduce such deletions or mutations into the subject s endogenous TR17 gene in monocytes. The engineered cells will express non functional TR17 polypeptides i.e. a receptor e.g. multimer that may be capable of binding but which is incapable of inducing signal transduction .

The compounds of the present invention are useful for diagnosis or treatment of various immune system related disorders in mammals preferably humans. Such disorders include but are not limited to tumors e.g. B cell and monocytic cell leukemias and lymphomas and tumor metastasis infections by bacteria viruses and other parasites immunodeficiencies inflammatory diseases lymphadenopathy autoimmune diseases and graft versus host disease.

TR17 is expressed in B cells and spleen. For a number of immune system related disorders substantially altered increased or decreased levels of TR17 gene expression can be detected in immune system tissue or other cells or bodily fluids e.g. sera plasma urine synovial fluid or spinal fluid taken from an individual having such a disorder relative to a standard TR17 gene expression level that is the TR17 expression level in immune system tissues or bodily fluids from an individual not having the immune system disorder. Thus the invention provides a diagnostic method useful during diagnosis of an system disorder which involves measuring the expression level of the gene encoding the TR17 polypeptide in immune system tissue or other cells or body fluid from an individual and comparing the measured gene expression level with a standard TR17 gene expression level whereby an increase or decrease in the gene expression level s compared to the standard is indicative of an immune system disorder or normal activation proliferation differentiation and or death.

In particular it is believed that certain tissues in mammals with cancer of cells or tissue of the immune system express significantly enhanced or reduced levels of normal or altered TR17 polypeptide and mRNA encoding the TR17 polypeptide when compared to a corresponding standard level. Further it is believed that enhanced or depressed levels of the TR17 polypeptide can be detected in certain body fluids e.g. sera plasma urine and spinal fluid or cells or tissue from mammals with such a cancer when compared to sera from mammals of the same species not having the cancer.

For example as disclosed herein TR17 are expressed in B cells. Accordingly polynucleotides of the invention e.g. polynucleotide sequences complementary to all or a portion of TR17 mRNA and antibodies and antibody fragments directed against the polypeptides of the invention may be used to quantitate or qualitate concentrations of cells of B cell lineage e.g. B cell leukemia cells expressing TR17 on their cell surfaces. These antibodies additionally have diagnostic applications in detecting abnormalities in the level of TR17 gene expression or abnormalities in the structure and or temporal tissue cellular or subcellular location of TR17. These diagnostic assays may be performed in vivo or in vitro such as for example on blood samples biopsy tissue or autopsy tissue.

Thus the invention provides a diagnostic method useful during diagnosis of a immune system disorder including cancers of this system which involves measuring the expression level of the gene encoding the TR17 polypeptide in immune system tissue or other cells or body fluid from an individual and comparing the measured gene expression level with a standard TR17 gene expression level whereby an increase or decrease in the gene expression level compared to the standard is indicative of an immune system disorder.

Where a diagnosis of a disorder in the immune system including diagnosis of a tumor has already been made according to conventional methods the present invention is useful as a prognostic indicator whereby patients exhibiting enhanced or depressed TR17 gene expression will experience a worse clinical outcome relative to patients expressing the gene at a level nearer the standard level.

By assaying the expression level of the gene encoding the TR17 polypeptide is intended qualitatively or quantitatively measuring or estimating the level of the TR17 polypeptide or the level of the mRNA encoding the TR17 polypeptide in a first biological sample either directly e.g. by determining or estimating absolute protein level or mRNA level or relatively e.g. by comparing to the TR17 polypeptide level or mRNA level in a second biological sample . Preferably the TR17 polypeptide level or mRNA level in the first biological sample is measured or estimated and compared to a standard TR17 polypeptide level or mRNA level the standard being taken from a second biological sample obtained from an individual not having the disorder or being determined by averaging levels from a population of individuals not having a disorder of the immune system. As will be appreciated in the art once a standard TR17 polypeptide level or mRNA level is known it can be used repeatedly as a standard for comparison.

By biological sample is intended any biological sample obtained from an individual cell line tissue culture or other source containing TR17 receptor protein including portions thereof or mRNA. As indicated biological samples include body fluids such as sera plasma urine synovial fluid and spinal fluid which contain free extracellular domains of the TR17 polypeptide immune system tissue and other tissue sources found to express complete or free extracellular domain of the TR17 receptor. Methods for obtaining tissue biopsies and body fluids from mammals are well known in the art. Where the biological sample is to include mRNA a tissue biopsy is the preferred source.

Total cellular RNA can be isolated from a biological sample using any suitable technique such as the single step guanidinium thiocyanate phenol chloroform method described in Chomczynski and Sacchi 162 156 159 1987 . Levels of mRNA encoding the TR17 polypeptide are then assayed using any appropriate method. These include Northern blot analysis S1 nuclease mapping the polymerase chain reaction PCR reverse transcription in combination with the polymerase chain reaction RT PCR and reverse transcription in combination with the ligase chain reaction RT LCR .

The present invention also relates to diagnostic assays such as quantitative and diagnostic assays for detecting levels of TR17 receptor protein or the soluble form thereof in a biological sample e.g. cells and tissues including determination of normal and abnormal levels of polypeptides. Thus for instance a diagnostic assay in accordance with the invention for detecting over expression of TR17 or soluble form thereof compared to normal control tissue samples may be used to detect the presence of tumors for example. Assay techniques that can be used to determine levels of a protein such as a TR17 protein of the present invention or a soluble form thereof in a sample derived from a host are well known to those of skill in the art. Such assay methods include radioimmunoassays competitive binding assays Western Blot analysis and ELISA assays. Assaying TR17 protein levels in a biological sample can occur using any art known method.

Assaying TR17 polypeptide levels in a biological sample can occur using antibody based techniques. For example TR17 polypeptide expression in tissues can be studied with classical immunohistological methods Jalkanen M. et al. 101 976 985 1985 Jalkanen M. et al. 105 3087 3096 1987 . Other antibody based methods useful for detecting TR17 polypeptide gene expression include immunoassays such as the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA and the radioimmunoassay RIA . Suitable antibody assay labels are known in the art and include enzyme labels such as glucose oxidase and radioisotopes such as iodine I I carbon C sulfur S tritium H indium In and technetium Tc and fluorescent labels such as fluorescein and rhodamine and biotin.

The tissue or cell type to be analyzed will generally include those which are known or suspected to express the TR17 gene such as for example cells of B cell lineage and the spleen or cells or tissue which are known or suspected to express the TR17 ligand gene such as for example cells of monocytic lineage . The protein isolation methods employed herein may for example be such as those described in Harlow and Lane Harlow E. and Lane D. 1988 Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The isolated cells can be derived from cell culture or from a patient. The analysis of cells taken from culture may be a necessary step in the assessment of cells that could be used as part of a cell based gene therapy technique or alternatively to test the effect of compounds on the expression of the TR17 gene or TR17 ligand gene.

For example antibodies or fragments of antibodies such as those described herein may be used to quantitatively or qualitatively detect the presence of TR17 gene products or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof. This can be accomplished for example by immunofluorescence techniques employing a fluorescently labeled antibody coupled with light microscopic flow cytometric or fluorimetric detection.

The antibodies or fragments thereof TR17 polypeptides and or TR17 ligands e.g. Neutrokine alpha and or APRIL of the present invention may additionally be employed histologically as in immunofluorescence immunoelectron microscopy or non immunological assays for in situ detection of TR17 gene products or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof or for TR17 binding to TR17 ligand. In situ detection may be accomplished by removing a histological specimen from a patient and applying thereto a labeled antibody or TR17 polypeptide of the present invention. The antibody or fragment or TR17 polypeptide is preferably applied by overlaying the labeled antibody or fragment onto a biological sample. Through the use of such a procedure it is possible to determine not only the presence of the TR17 gene product or conserved variants or peptide fragments or TR17 polypeptide binding but also its distribution in the examined tissue. Using the present invention those of ordinary skill will readily perceive that any of a wide variety of histological methods such as staining procedures can be modified in order to achieve such in situ detection.

Immunoassays and non immunoassays for TR17 gene products or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof will typically comprise incubating a sample such as a biological fluid a tissue extract freshly harvested cells or lysates of cells which have been incubated in cell culture in the presence of a detectably labeled antibody capable of binding TR17 gene products or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof and detecting the bound antibody by any of a number of techniques well known in the art.

Immunoassays and non immunoassays for TR17 ligand gene products or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof will typically comprise incubating a sample such as a biological fluid a tissue extract freshly harvested cells or lysates of cells which have been incubated in cell culture in the presence of a detectable or labeled TR17 polypeptide capable of identifying TR17 ligand gene products or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof and detecting the bound TR17 polypeptide by any of a number of techniques well known in the art.

The biological sample may be brought in contact with and immobilized onto a solid phase support or carrier such as nitrocellulose or other solid support which is capable of immobilizing cells cell particles or soluble proteins. The support may then be washed with suitable buffers followed by treatment with the detectably labeled anti TR17 antibody or detectable TR17 polypeptide. The solid phase support may then be washed with the buffer a second time to remove unbound antibody or polypeptide. Optionally the antibody is subsequently labeled. The amount of bound label on solid support may then be detected by conventional means.

By solid phase support or carrier is intended any support capable of binding an antigen or an antibody. Well known supports or carriers include glass polystyrene polypropylene polyethylene dextran nylon amylases natural and modified celluloses polyacrylamides gabbros and magnetite. The nature of the carrier can be either soluble to some extent or insoluble for the purposes of the present invention. The support material may have virtually any possible structural configuration so long as the coupled molecule is capable of binding to an antigen or antibody. Thus the support configuration may be spherical as in a bead or cylindrical as in the inside surface of a test tube or the external surface of a rod. Alternatively the surface may be flat such as a sheet test strip etc. Preferred supports include polystyrene beads. Those skilled in the art will know many other suitable carriers for binding antibody or antigen or will be able to ascertain the same by use of routine experimentation.

The binding activity of a given lot of anti TR17 antibody or TR17 polypeptide may be determined according to well known methods. Those skilled in the art will be able to determine operative and optimal assay conditions for each determination by employing routine experimentation.

In addition to assaying TR17 polypeptide levels or polynucleotide levels in a biological sample obtained from an individual TR17 polypeptide or polynucleotide can also be detected in vivo by imaging. For example in one embodiment of the invention TR17 polypeptide is used to image monocytic leukemias or lymphomas. In another embodiment TR17 polynucleotides of the invention and or anti TR17 antibodies e.g. polynucleotides complementary to all or a portion of TR17 mRNA are used to image B cell leukemias or lymphomas.

Antibody labels or markers for in vivo imaging of TR17 polypeptide include those detectable by X radiography NMR MRI CAT scans or ESR. For X radiography suitable labels include radioisotopes such as barium or cesium which emit detectable radiation but are not overtly harmful to the subject. Suitable markers for NMR and ESR include those with a detectable characteristic spin such as deuterium which may be incorporated into the antibody by labeling of nutrients for the relevant hybridoma. Where in vivo imaging is used to detect enhanced levels of TR17 polypeptide for diagnosis in humans it may be preferable to use human antibodies or humanized chimeric monoclonal antibodies. Such antibodies can be produced using techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art. For example methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. See for review Morrison 229 1202 1985 Oi et al. 4 214 1986 Cabilly et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 Taniguchi et al. EP 171496 Morrison et al. EP 173494 Neuberger et al. WO 8601533 Robinson et al. WO 8702671 Boulianne et al. 312 643 1984 Neuberger et al. 314 268 1985 .

Additionally any TR17 polypeptide whose presence can be detected can be administered. For example TR17 polypeptides labeled with a radio opaque or other appropriate compound can be administered and visualized in vivo as discussed above for labeled antibodies. Further such TR17 polypeptides can be utilized for in vitro diagnostic procedures.

A TR17 polypeptide specific antibody or antibody fragment which has been labeled with an appropriate detectable imaging moiety such as a radioisotope for example 131I In Tc a radio opaque substance or a material detectable by nuclear magnetic resonance is introduced for example parenterally subcutaneously or intraperitoneally into the mammal to be examined for immune system disorder. It will be understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging system used will determine the quantity of imaging moiety needed to produce diagnostic images. In the case of a radioisotope moiety for a human subject the quantity of radioactivity injected will normally range from about 5 to 20 millicuries of Tc. The labeled antibody or antibody fragment will then preferentially accumulate at the location of cells which contain TR17 protein. In vivo tumor imaging is described in S. W. Burchiel et al. Immunopharmacokinetics of Radiolabeled Antibodies and Their Fragments Chapter 13 in S. W. Burchiel and B. A. Rhodes eds. Masson Publishing Inc. 1982 .

With respect to antibodies one of the ways in which the anti TR17 antibody can be detectably labeled is by linking the same to an enzyme and using the linked product in an enzyme immunoassay EIA Voller A. The Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay ELISA 1978 Diagnostic Horizons 2 1 7 Microbiological Associates Quarterly Publication Walkersville Md. Voller et al. 31 507 520 1978 Butler J. E. 73 482 523 1981 Maggio E. ed. 1980 Enzyme Immunoassay CRC Press Boca Raton Fla. Ishikawa E. et al. eds. 1981 Enzyme Immunoassay Kgaku Shoin Tokyo . The enzyme which is bound to the antibody will react with an appropriate substrate preferably a chromogenic substrate in such a manner as to produce a chemical moiety which can be detected for example by spectrophotometric fluorimetric or by visual means. Enzymes which can be used to detectably label the antibody include but are not limited to malate dehydrogenase staphylococcal nuclease delta 5 steroid isomerase yeast alcohol dehydrogenase alpha glycerophosphate dehydrogenase triose phosphate isomerase horseradish peroxidase alkaline phosphatase asparaginase glucose oxidase beta galactosidase ribonuclease urease catalase glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase glucoamylase and acetylcholinesterase. Additionally the detection can be accomplished by colorimetric methods which employ a chromogenic substrate for the enzyme. Detection may also be accomplished by visual comparison of the extent of enzymatic reaction of a substrate in comparison with similarly prepared standards.

Detection may also be accomplished using any of a variety of other immunoassays. For example by radioactively labeling the antibodies or antibody fragments it is possible to detect TR17 through the use of a radioimmunoassay RIA see for example Weintraub B. Principles of Radioimmunoassays Seventh Training Course on Radioligand Assay Techniques The Endocrine Society March 1986 which is incorporated by reference herein . The radioactive isotope can be detected by means including but not limited to a gamma counter a scintillation counter or autoradiography.

It is also possible to label the antibody with a fluorescent compound. When the fluorescently labeled antibody is exposed to light of the proper wave length its presence can then be detected due to fluorescence. Among the most commonly used fluorescent labeling compounds are fluorescein isothiocyanate rhodamine phycoerythrin phycocyanin allophycocyanin ophthaldehyde and fluorescamine.

The antibody can also be detectably labeled using fluorescence emitting metals such as Eu or others of the lanthanide series. These metals can be attached to the antibody using such metal chelating groups as diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid DTPA or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA .

The antibody also can be detectably labeled by coupling it to a chemiluminescent compound. The presence of the chemiluminescent tagged antibody is then determined by detecting the presence of luminescence that arises during the course of a chemical reaction. Examples of particularly useful chemiluminescent labeling compounds are luminol isoluminol theromatic acridinium ester imidazole acridinium salt and oxalate ester.

Likewise a bioluminescent compound may be used to label the antibody of the present invention. Bioluminescence is a type of chemiluminescence found in biological systems in which a catalytic protein increases the efficiency of the chemiluminescent reaction. The presence of a bioluminescent protein is determined by detecting the presence of luminescence. Important bioluminescent compounds for purposes of labeling are luciferin luciferase and aequorin.

The invention further relates to antibodies which act as agonists or antagonists of the polypeptides of the present invention. For example the present invention includes antibodies which disrupt the receptor ligand interactions with the polypeptides of the invention either partially or fully. Included are both receptor specific antibodies and ligand specific antibodies. Included are receptor specific antibodies which do not prevent ligand binding but prevent receptor activation. Receptor activation i.e. signaling may be determined by techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art.

For example the present invention includes antibodies which disrupt the ability of the proteins of the invention to multimerize. In another example the present invention includes antibodies which allow the proteins of the invention to multimerize but disrupts the ability of the proteins of the invention to bind one or more TR17 ligand s e.g. Neutrokine alpha and or APRIL . In yet another example the present invention includes antibodies which allow the proteins of the invention to multimerize and bind TR17 ligand s but blocks biological activity associated with the TR17 ligand complex.

As discussed above antibodies to the TR17 proteins of the invention can in turn be utilized to generate anti idiotype antibodies that mimic TR17 using techniques well known to those skilled in the art. See e.g. Greenspan Bona 7 5 437 444 1989 and Nissinoff 147 8 2429 2438 1991 . For example antibodies which bind to TR17 and competitively inhibit TR17 multimerization and or binding to ligand can be used to generate anti idiotypes that mimic the TR17 mutimerization and or binding domain and as a consequence bind to and neutralize TR17 and or its ligands e.g. Neutrokine alpha and or APRIL . Such neutralizing anti idiotypes or Fab fragments of such anti idiotypes can be used in therapeutic regimens to neutralize TR17 ligands e.g. Neutrokine alpha and or APRIL . For example such anti idiotypic antibodies can be used to bind TR17 or to bind TR17 ligands and thereby block TR17 mediated cell signalling.

The Tumor Necrosis Factor TNF family ligands are known to be among the most pleiotropic cytokines inducing a large number of cellular responses including cytotoxicity anti viral activity immunoregulatory activities and the transcriptional regulation of several genes D. V. Goeddel et al. Tumor Necrosis Factors Gene Structure and Biological Activities 51 597 609 1986 Cold Spring Harbor B. Beutler and A. Cerami 57 505 518 1988 L. J. Old 258 59 75 1988 W. Fiers 285 199 224 1991 . The TNF family ligands induce such various cellular responses by binding to TNF family receptors including the TR17 of the present invention.

TR17 polynucleotides polypeptides agonists and or antagonists e.g. agonistic antibodies of the invention may be administered to a patient e.g. mammal preferably human afflicted with any disease or disorder mediated directly or indirectly by defective or deficient levels of TR17. Alternatively a gene therapy approach may be applied to treat such diseases or disorders. In one embodiment of the invention TR17 polynucleotide sequences are used to detect mutein TR17 genes including defective genes. Mutein genes may be identified in in vitro diagnostic assays and by comparison of the TR17 nucleotide sequence disclosed herein with that of a TR17 gene obtained from a patient suspected of harboring a defect in this gene. Defective genes may be replaced with normal TR17 encoding genes using techniques known to one skilled in the art.

In another embodiment the TR17 polypeptides polynucleotides agonists and or antagonists of the present invention are used as research tools for studying the phenotypic effects that result from inhibiting TR17 TR17 ligand interactions on various cell types. TR17 polypeptides and antagonists e.g. monoclonal antibodies to TR17 also may be used in in vitro assays for detecting TR17 TR17 ligands or the interactions thereof.

Cells or tissue which express the TR17 polypeptide and are believed to have a potent cellular response to TR17 ligands include B cells spleen brain and testis. By a cellular response to a TNF family ligand is intended any genotypic phenotypic and or morphologic change to a cell cell line tissue tissue culture or patient that is induced by a TNF family ligand. As indicated such cellular responses include not only normal physiological responses to TNF family ligands but also diseases associated dysregulation of these physiological responses such as for example diseases associated with increased apoptosis or the inhibition of apoptosis. Apoptosis programmed cell death is a physiological mechanism involved in the deletion of peripheral T lymphocytes of the immune system and its dysregulation can lead to a number of different pathogenic processes J.

Many of the pathologies associated with HIV are mediated by apoptosis including HIV induced nephropathy and HIV encephalitis. Thus in additional preferred embodiments TR17 polynucleotides polypeptides and or TR17 agonists e.g. anti TR17 antibodies or antagonists of the invention are used to treat AIDS and pathologies associated with AIDS.

The state of immunodeficiency that defines AIDS is secondary to a decrease in the number and function of CD4 T lymphocytes. Recent reports estimate the daily loss of CD4 T cells to be between 3.5 10and 2 10cells Wei et al. 373 117 122 1995 . One cause of CD4 T cell depletion in the setting of HIV infection is believed to be HIV induced apoptosis see for example Meyaard et al. 257 217 219 1992 Groux et al. 175 331 1992 and Oyaizu et al. in Andrieu and Lu Eds. Plenum Press New York 1995 pp. 101 114 . Indeed HIV induced apoptotic cell death has been demonstrated not only in vitro but also more importantly in infected individuals J. C. Ameisen 8 1197 1213 1994 T. H. Finkel and N. K. Banda 6 605 615 1995 C. A. Muro Cacho et al. 154 5555 5566 1995 . Furthermore apoptosis and CD4 T lymphocyte depletion is tightly correlated in different animal models of AIDS T. Brunner et al. 373 441 444 1995 M. L. Gougeon et al. 9 553 563 1993 and apoptosis is not observed in those animal models in which viral replication does not result in AIDS. Id. Further data indicates that uninfected but primed or activated T lymphocytes from HIV infected individuals undergo apoptosis after encountering the TNF family ligand FasL. Using monocytic cell lines that result in death following HIV infection it has been demonstrated that infection of U937 cells with HIV results in the de novo expression of FasL and that FasL mediates HIV induced apoptosis A. D. Badley et al. 70 199 206 1996 . Further the TNF family ligand was detectable in uninfected macrophages and its expression was upregulated following HIV infection resulting in selective killing of uninfected CD4 T lymphocytes. Id. Thus by the invention a method for treating HIV individuals is provided which involves administering TR17 and or TR17 agonists e.g. anti TR17 antibodies or antagonists of the present invention to reduce selective killing of CD4 T lymphocytes. Modes of administration and dosages are discussed in detail below.

Activated human T cells are induced to undergo programmed cell death apoptosis upon triggering through the CD3 T cell receptor complex a process termed activated induced cell death AICD . AICD of CD4 T cells isolated from HIV Infected asymptomatic individuals has been reported Groux et al. supra . Thus AICD may play a role in the depletion of CD4 T cells and the progression to AIDS in HIV infected individuals. Thus the present invention provides a method of inhibiting TNF ligand mediated T cell death in HIV patients comprising administering a TR17 polypeptide of the invention preferably a soluble TR17 polypeptide to the patients. In one embodiment the patient is asymptomatic when treatment with TR17 commences. If desired prior to treatment peripheral blood T cells may be extracted from an HIV patient and tested for susceptibility to TNF ligand mediated cell death by procedures known in the art. In one embodiment a patient s blood or plasma is contacted with TR17 ex vivo. The TR17 may be bound to a suitable chromatography matrix by procedures known in the art. The patient s blood or plasma flows through a chromatography column containing TR17 bound to the matrix before being returned to the patient. The immobilized TR17 binds TNF ligand thus removing TNF ligand protein from the patient s blood.

In additional embodiments a TR17 polypeptide of the invention is administered in combination with other inhibitors of T cell apoptosis. For example Fas mediated apoptosis and TRAIL mediated apoptosis have also has been implicated in loss of T cells in HIV individuals See e.g. Katsikis et al. 181 2029 2036 1995 . Thus a patient susceptible to Fas ligand mediated and or TRAIL mediated T cell death may be treated with an agent that blocks Fas ligand Fas receptor interactions and or an agent that blocks TRAIL TRAIL interactions.

Suitable agents for blocking binding of Fas ligand to Fas that may be administered with the TR17 polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention including TR17 agonists e.g. angonistic antibodies and or antagonists include but are not limited to soluble Fas polypeptides mulitmeric forms of soluble Fas polypeptides e.g. dimers of sFas Fc anti Fas antibodies that bind Fas without transducing the biological signal that results in apoptosis anti Fas ligand antibodies that block binding of Fas ligand to Fas and muteins of Fas ligand that bind Fas but do not transduce the biological signal that results in apoptosis. Preferably the antibodies employed according to this method are monoclonal antibodies. Examples of suitable agents for blocking Fas ligand Fas interactions including blocking anti Fas monoclonal antibodies are described in International application publication number WO 95 10540 hereby incorporated by reference.

Suitable agents which also block binding of TRAIL to a TRAIL receptor that may be administered with the polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the present invention include but are not limited to soluble TRAIL receptor polypeptides e.g. a soluble form of OPG DR4 International application publication number WO 98 32856 TR5 International application publication number WO 98 30693 and DR5 International application publication number WO 98 41629 multimeric forms of soluble TRAIL receptor polypeptides and TRAIL receptor antibodies that bind the TRAIL receptor without transducing the biological signal that results in apoptosis anti TRAIL antibodies that block binding of TRAIL to one or more TRAIL receptors and muteins of TRAIL that bind TRAIL receptors but do not transduce the biological signal that results in apoptosis. Preferably the antibodies employed according to this method are monoclonal antibodies.

The naturally occurring balance between endogenous stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis is one in which inhibitory influences predominate. Rastinejad et al. 56 345 355 1989 . In those rare instances in which neovascularization occurs under normal physiological conditions such as wound healing organ regeneration embryonic development and female reproductive processes angiogenesis is stringently regulated and spatially and temporally delimited. Under conditions of pathological angiogenesis such as that characterizing solid tumor growth these regulatory controls fail. Unregulated angiogenesis becomes pathologic and sustains progression of many neoplastic and non neoplastic diseases. A number of serious diseases are dominated by abnormal neovascularization including solid tumor growth and metastases arthritis some types of eye disorders and psoriasis. See e.g. reviews by Moses et al. 9 630 634 1991 Folkman et al. 333 1757 1763 1995 Auerbach et al. 29 401 411 1985 Folkman Advances in Cancer Research eds. Klein and Weinhouse Academic Press New York pp. 175 203 1985 Patz 94 715 743 1982 and Folkman et al. 221 719 725 1983 . In a number of pathological conditions the process of angiogenesis contributes to the disease state. For example significant data have accumulated which suggest that the growth of solid tumors is dependent on angiogenesis. Folkman and Klagsbrun 235 442 447 1987 .

The present invention provides for treatment of diseases or disorders associated with neovascularization by administration of the TR17 polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention including TR17 agonists e.g. agonistic antibodies and or antagonists . Malignant and metastatic conditions which can be treated with the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention include but are not limited to those malignancies solid tumors and cancers described herein and otherwise known in the art for a review of such disorders see Fishman et al.

The polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention and or agonists and or antagonists thereof can also be employed to inhibit the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells and therefore may be employed to protect bone marrow stem cells from chemotherapeutic agents during chemotherapy. This antiproliferative effect may allow administration of higher doses of chemotherapeutic agents and therefore more effective chemotherapeutic treatment.

The polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention and or agonists and or antagonists thereof may also be employed for the expansion of immature hematopoeitic progenitor cells for example granulocytes macrophages or monocytes e.g. C kit Sca 1 by temporarily preventing their differentiation. These bone marrow cells may be cultured in vitro. Thus TR17 may be useful as a modulator of hematopoietic stem cells in vitro for the purpose of bone marrow transplantation and or gene therapy. Since stem cells are rare and are most useful for introducing genes into for gene therapy TR17 can be used to isolate enriched populations of stem cells. Stem cells can be enriched by culturing cells in the presence of cytotoxins such as 5 Fu which kills rapidly dividing cells where as the stem cells will be protected by TR17. These stem cells can be returned to a bone marrow transplant patient or can then be used for transfection of the desired gene for gene therapy. In addition TR17 can be injected into animals which results in the release of stem cells from the bone marrow of the animal into the peripheral blood. These stem cells can be isolated for the purpose of autologous bone marrow transplantation or manipulation for gene therapy. After the patient has finished chemotherapy or radiation treatment the isolated stem cells can be returned to the patient.

In a specific embodiment polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention and or angonists and or antagonists thereof may be used to increase the concentration of blood cells in individuals in need of such increase i.e. in hematopoietin therapy .

In a specific embodiment the polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention and or agonists or antagonists thereof are used in erythropoietin therapy which is directed toward supplementing the oxygen carrying capacity of blood.

Examples of patient conditions that require supplementation of the oxygen carrying capacity of blood and which are within the scope of this invention include but are not limited to treatment of blood disorders characterized by low or defective red blood cell production anemia associated with chronic renal failure stimulation of reticulocyte response development of ferrokinetic effects such as plasma iron turnover effects and marrow transit time effects erythrocyte mass changes stimulation of hemoglobin C synthesis and increasing levels of hematocrit in vertebrates. The invention also provides for treatment to enhance the oxygen carrying capacity of an individual such as for example an individual encountering hypoxic environmental conditions.

TR17 polynucleotides polypeptides and or agonists or antagonists may also be employed to regulate hematopoiesis by regulating the activation and differentiation of various hematopoietic progenitor cells for example to release mature leukocytes from the bone marrow following chemotherapy i.e. in stem cell mobilization.

TR17 polynucleotides polypeptides and or agonists or antagonists may also be employed to enhance host defenses against resistant chronic and acute infections for example myobacterial infections via the attraction and activation of microbicidal leukocytes.

TR17 polynucleotides polypeptides and or agonists or antagonists also increases the presence of eosinophils which have the distinctive function of killing the larvae of parasites that invade tissues as in schistosomiasis trichinosis and

TR17 polynucleotides or polypeptides or agonists of TR17 e.g. agonistic antibodies can be used in the treatment of infectious agents. For example by increasing the immune response particularly increasing the proliferation and differentiation of B cells infectious diseases may be treated. The immune response may be increased by either enhancing an existing immune response or by initiating a new immune response. Alternatively TR17 polynucleotides or polypeptides or agonists or antagonists of TR17 may also directly inhibit the infectious agent without necessarily eliciting an immune response.

The agonists and antagonists may be employed in a composition with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier e.g. as described above.

The antagonists may be employed for instance to inhibit TR17 the chemotaxis and activation of macrophages and their precursors and of neutrophils basophils B lymphocytes and some T cell subsets e.g. activated and CD8 cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells in certain auto immune and chronic inflammatory and infective diseases. Examples of auto immune diseases include multiple sclerosis and insulin dependent diabetes. The antagonists may also be employed to treat infectious diseases including silicosis sarcoidosis idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis by preventing the recruitment and activation of mononuclear phagocytes. They may also be employed to treat idiopathic hyper eosinophilic syndrome by preventing eosinophil production and migration. Endotoxic shock may also be treated by the antagonists by preventing the migration of macrophages and their production of the TR17 polypeptides of the present invention. The antagonists may also be employed for treating atherosclerosis by preventing monocyte infiltration in the artery wall. The antagonists may also be employed to treat histamine mediated allergic reactions and immunological disorders including late phase allergic reactions chronic urticaria and atopic dermatitis by inhibiting chemokine induced mast cell and basophil degranulation and release of histamine. IgE mediated allergic reactions such as allergic asthma rhinitis and eczema may also be treated. The antagonists may also be employed to treat chronic and acute inflammation by preventing the attraction of monocytes to a wound area. They may also be employed to regulate normal pulmonary macrophage populations since chronic and acute inflammatory pulmonary diseases are associated with sequestration of mononuclear phagocytes in the lung. Antagonists may also be employed to treat rheumatoid arthritis by preventing the attraction of monocytes into synovial fluid in the joints of patients. Monocyte influx and activation plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of both degenerative and inflammatory arthropathies. The antagonists may be employed to interfere with the deleterious cascades attributed primarily to IL 1 and TNF which prevents the biosynthesis of other inflammatory cytokines. In this way the antagonists may be employed to prevent inflammation. The antagonists may also be employed to inhibit prostaglandin independent fever induced by TR17. The antagonists may also be employed to treat cases of bone marrow failure for example aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.

More generally polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention and or agonists and or antagonists thereof are useful in regulating i.e. elevating or reducing immune response. For example polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention may be useful in preparation or recovery from surgery trauma radiation therapy chemotherapy and transplantation or may be used to boost immune response and or recovery in the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Alternatively polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention and or agonists and or antagonists thereof are useful as immunosuppressive agents for example in the treatment or prevention of autoimmune disorders. In specific embodiments polynucleotides and or polypeptides of the invention are used to treat or prevent chronic inflammatory allergic or autoimmune conditions such as those described herein or are otherwise known in the art.

In one aspect the present invention is directed to a method for enhancing TR17 mediated signaling by a TNF family ligand which involves administering to a cell which expresses the TR17 polypeptide an effective amount of TR17 ligand analog or an agonist capable of increasing TR17 mediated signaling. Preferably TR17 mediated signaling is increased to treat a disease wherein increased apoptosis decreased cytokine and adhesion molecule expression or decreased cell proliferation is exhibited. An agonist can include soluble forms of TR17 and monoclonal antibodies directed against the TR17 polypeptide.

In a further aspect the present invention is directed to a method for inhibiting TR17 mediated signaling induced by a TNF family ligand which involves administering to a cell which expresses the TR17 polypeptide an effective amount of an antagonist capable of decreasing TR17 mediated signaling. Preferably TR17 mediated signaling is decreased to treat a disease wherein decreased apoptosis or NFkB expression or increased cell proliferation is exhibited. An antagonist can include soluble forms of TR17 and monoclonal antibodies directed against the TR17 polypeptide.

By agonist is intended naturally occurring and synthetic compounds capable of enhancing or potentiating TR17 mediated signaling. By antagonist is intended naturally occurring and synthetic compounds capable of inhibiting apoptosis. Whether any candidate agonist or antagonist of the present invention can enhance or inhibit TR17 mediated signaling can be determined using art known TNF family ligand receptor cellular response assays including those described in more detail below.

One such screening procedure involves the use of melanophores which are transfected to express the receptor of the present invention. Such a screening technique is described in PCT WO 92 01810. Such an assay may be employed for example for screening for a compound which inhibits or enhances activation of the receptor polypeptide of the present invention by contacting the melanophore cells which encode the receptor with both a TNF family ligand and the candidate antagonist or agonist . Inhibition or enhancement of the signal generated by the ligand indicates that the compound is an antagonist or agonist of the ligand receptor signaling pathway.

Other screening techniques include the use of cells which express the receptor for example transfected CHO cells in a system which measures extracellular pH changes caused by receptor activation. For example compounds may be contacted with a cell which expresses the receptor polypeptide of the present invention and a second messenger response e.g. signal transduction or pH changes may be measured to determine whether the potential compound activates or inhibits the receptor.

Another such screening technique involves introducing RNA encoding the receptor into to transiently express the receptor. The receptor oocytes may then be contacted with the receptor ligand and a compound to be screened followed by detection of inhibition or activation of a calcium signal in the case of screening for compounds which are thought to inhibit activation of the receptor.

Another screening technique well known in the art involves expressing in cells a construct wherein the receptor is linked to a phospholipase C or D. Exemplary cells include endothelial cells smooth muscle cells embryonic kidney cells etc. The screening may be accomplished as hereinabove described by detecting activation of the receptor or inhibition of activation of the receptor from the phospholipase signal.

Another method involves screening for compounds which inhibit activation of the receptor polypeptide of the present invention antagonists by determining inhibition of binding of labeled ligand to cells which have the receptor on the surface thereof. Such a method involves transfecting a eukaryotic cell with DNA encoding the receptor such that the cell expresses the receptor on its surface and contacting the cell with a compound in the presence of a labeled form of a known ligand. The ligand can be labeled e.g. by radioactivity. The amount of labeled ligand bound to the receptors is measured e.g. by measuring radioactivity of the receptors. If the compound binds to the receptor as determined by a reduction of labeled ligand which binds to the receptors the binding of labeled ligand to the receptor is inhibited.

Further screening assays for agonists and antagonists of the present invention are described in L. A. Tartaglia and D. V. Goeddel 267 4304 4307 1992 .

Thus in a further aspect a screening method is provided for determining whether a candidate agonist or antagonist is capable of enhancing or inhibiting a cellular response to a TNF family ligand. The method involves contacting cells which express the TR17 polypeptide with a candidate compound and a TNF family ligand assaying a cellular response and comparing the cellular response to a standard cellular response the standard being assayed when contact is made with the ligand in absence of the candidate compound whereby an increased cellular response over the standard indicates that the candidate compound is an agonist of the ligand receptor signaling pathway and a decreased cellular response compared to the standard indicates that the candidate compound is an antagonist of the ligand receptor signaling pathway. By assaying a cellular response is intended qualitatively or quantitatively measuring a cellular response to a candidate compound and or a TNF family ligand e.g. determining or estimating an increase or decrease in B and or T cell proliferation or tritiated thymidine labeling . By the invention a cell expressing the TR17 polypeptide can be contacted with either an endogenous or exogenously administered TNF family ligand.

Agonists according to the present invention include naturally occurring and synthetic compounds such as for example the CD40 ligand neutral amino acids zinc estrogen androgens viral genes such as Adenovirus ElB Baculovirus p35 and IAP Cowpox virus crmA Epstein Barr virus BHRF1 LMP 1 African swine fever virus LMW5 HL and Herpesvirus yl 34.5 calpain inhibitors cysteine protease inhibitors and tumor promoters such as PMA Phenobarbital and   Hexachlorocyclohexane .

Antagonist according to the present invention include naturally occurring and synthetic compounds such as for example TNF family ligand peptide fragments transforming growth factor neurotransmitters such as glutamate dopamine N methyl D aspartate tumor suppressors p53 cytolytic T cells and antimetabolites. Preferred agonists include chemotherapeutic drugs such as for example cisplatin doxorubicin bleomycin cytosine arabinoside nitrogen mustard methotrexate and vincristine. Others include ethanol and amyloid peptide. Science 267 1457 1458 1995 . Further preferred agonists include TR17 polypeptides of the invention polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies raised against the TR17 polypeptide or a fragment thereof. Such agonist antibodies raised against a TNF family receptor are disclosed in L. A. Tartaglia et al. 88 9292 9296 1991 and L. A. Tartaglia and D. V. Goeddel 267 4304 4307 1992 . See also PCT Application WO 94 09137.

Other potential antagonists according to the invention include antisense molecules. Antisense technology can be used to control gene expression through antisense DNA or RNA or through triple helix formation. Antisense techniques are discussed for example in Okano 56 560 1991 CRC Press Boca Raton Fla. 1988 . Triple helix formation is discussed in for instance Lee et al. 6 3073 1979 Cooney et al. 241 456 1988 and Dervan et al. 251 1360 1991 . The methods are based on binding of a polynucleotide to a complementary DNA or RNA.

In specific embodiments antagonists according to the present invention are nucleic acids corresponding to the sequences contained in TR17 SEQ ID NO 1 . In one embodiment antisense sequence is generated internally by the organism in another embodiment the antisense sequence is separately administered see for example Okano H. et al. 56 560 1991 and Oligodeoxynucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression CRC Press Boca Raton Fla. 1988 . Antisense technology can be used to control gene expression through antisense DNA or RNA or through triple helix formation. Antisense techniques are discussed for example in Okano 56 560 1991 Oligodeoxynucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression CRC Press Boca Raton Fla. 1988 . Triple helix formation is discussed in for instance Lee et al. 6 3073 1979 Cooney et al. 241 456 1988 and Dervan et al. 251 1300 1991 . The methods are based on binding of a polynucleotide to a complementary DNA or RNA.

For example the 5 coding portion of a polynucleotide that encodes the mature polypeptide of the present invention may be used to design an antisense RNA oligonucleotide of from about 10 to 40 base pairs in length. A DNA oligonucleotide is designed to be complementary to a region of the gene involved in transcription thereby preventing transcription and the production of the receptor. The antisense RNA oligonucleotide hybridizes to the mRNA in vivo and blocks translation of the mRNA molecule into receptor polypeptide. The oligonucleotides described above can also be delivered to cells such that the antisense RNA or DNA may be expressed in vivo to inhibit production of the receptor.

In one embodiment the TR17 antisense nucleic acid of the invention is produced intracellularly by transcription from an exogenous sequence. For example a vector or a portion thereof is transcribed producing an antisense nucleic acid RNA of the invention. Such a vector would contain a sequence encoding the TR17 antisense nucleic acid. Such a vector can remain episomal or become chromosomally integrated as long as it can be transcribed to produce the desired antisense RNA. Such vectors can be constructed by recombinant DNA technology methods standard in the art. Vectors can be plasmid viral or others know in the art used for replication and expression in vertebrate cells. Expression of the sequence encoding TR17 or fragments thereof can be by any promoter known in the art to act in vertebrate preferably human cells. Such promoters can be inducible or constitutive. Such promoters include but are not limited to the SV40 early promoter region Bernoist and Chambon 29 304 310 1981 the promoter contained in the 3 long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus Yamamoto et al. 22 787 797 1980 the herpes thymidine promoter Wagner et al. 78 1441 1445 1981 the regulatory sequences of the metallothionein gene Brinster et al. 296 39 42 1982 etc.

The antisense nucleic acids of the invention comprise a sequence complementary to at least a portion of an RNA transcript of a TR17 gene. However absolute complementarity although preferred is not required. A sequence complementary to at least a portion of an RNA referred to herein means a sequence having sufficient complementarity to be able to hybridize with the RNA forming a stable duplex in the case of double stranded TR17 antisense nucleic acids a single strand of the duplex DNA may thus be tested or triplex formation may be assayed. The ability to hybridize will depend on both the degree of complementarity and the length of the antisense nucleic acid Generally the larger the hybridizing nucleic acid the more base mismatches with a TR17RNA it may contain and still form a stable duplex or triplex as the case may be . One skilled in the art can ascertain a tolerable degree of mismatch by use of standard procedures to determine the melting point of the hybridized complex.

Oligonucleotides that are complementary to the 5 end of the message e.g. the 5 untranslated sequence up to and including the AUG initiation codon should work most efficiently at inhibiting translation. However sequences complementary to the 3 untranslated sequences of mRNAs have been shown to be effective at inhibiting translation of mRNAs as well. See generally Wagner R. 372 333 335 1994 . Thus oligonucleotides complementary to either the 5 or 3 non translated non coding regions of the TR17 shown in could be used in an antisense approach to inhibit translation of endogenous TR17 mRNA. Oligonucleotides complementary to the 5 untranslated region of the mRNA should include the complement of the AUG start codon. Antisense oligonucleotides complementary to mRNA coding regions are less efficient inhibitors of translation but could be used in accordance with the invention. While antisense nucleotides complementary to the TR17 coding region sequence may be used those complementary to the transcribed untranslated region are most preferred. Whether designed to hybridize to the 5 3 or coding region of TR17 mRNA antisense nucleic acids should be at least six nucleotides in length and are preferably oligonucleotides ranging from 6 to about 50 nucleotides in length. In specific aspects the oligonucleotide is at least 10 nucleotides at least 17 nucleotides at least 25 nucleotides or at least 50 nucleotides.

The polynucleotides of the invention can be DNA or RNA or chimeric mixtures or derivatives or modified versions thereof single stranded or double stranded. The oligonucleotide can be modified at the base moiety sugar moiety or phosphate backbone for example to improve stability of the molecule hybridization etc. The oligonucleotide may include other appended groups such as peptides e.g. for targeting host cell receptors in vivo or agents facilitating transport across the cell membrane see e.g. Letsinger et al. 86 6553 6556 1989 Lemaitre et al. 84 648 652 1987 PCT Publication No. WO88 09810 or the blood brain barrier see e.g. PCT Publication No. WO89 10134 hybridization triggered cleavage agents. See e.g. Krol et al. 6 958 976 1988 or intercalating agents. See e.g. Zon 5 539 549 1988 . To this end the oligonucleotide may be conjugated to another molecule e.g. a peptide hybridization triggered cross linking agent transport agent hybridization triggered cleavage agent etc.

The antisense oligonucleotide may comprise at least one modified base moiety which is selected from the group including but not limited to 5 fluorouracil 5 bromouracil 5 chlorouracil 5 iodouracil hypoxanthine xantine 4 acetylcytosine 5 carboxyhydroxylmethyl uracil 5 carboxymethylaminomethyl 2 thiouridine 5 carboxymethylaminomethyluracil dihydrouracil beta D galactosylqueosine inosine N6 isopentenyladenine 1 methylguanine 1 methylinosine 2 2 dimethylguanine 2 methyladenine 2 methylguanine 3 methylcytosine 5 methylcytosine N6 adenine 7 methylguanine 5 methylaminomethyluracil 5 methoxyaminomethyl 2 thiouracil beta D mannosylqueosine 5  methoxycarboxymethyluracil 5 methoxyuracil 2 methylthio N 6 isopentenyladenine uracil 5 oxyacetic acid v wybutoxosine pseudouracil queosine 2 thiocytosine 5 methyl 2 thiouracil 2 thiouracil 4 thiouracil 5 methyluracil uracil 5 oxyacetic acid methylester uracil 5 oxyacetic acid v 5 methyl 2 thiouracil 3 3 amino 3 N 2 carboxypropyl uracil acp3 w and 2 6 diaminopurine.

The antisense oligonucleotide may also comprise at least one modified sugar moiety selected from the group including but not limited to arabinose 2 fluoroarabinose xylulose and hexose.

In yet another embodiment the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified phosphate backbone selected from the group including but not limited to a phosphorothioate a phosphorodithioate a phosphoramidothioate a phosphoramidate a phosphordiamidate a methylphosphonate an alkyl phosphotriester and a formacetal or analog thereof.

In yet another embodiment the antisense oligonucleotide is an anomeric oligonucleotide. An anomeric oligonucleotide forms specific double stranded hybrids with complementary RNA in which contrary to the usual units the strands run parallel to each other Gautier et al. 15 6625 6641 1987 . The oligonucleotide is a 2 0 methylribonucleotide Inoue et al. 15 6131 6148 1987 or a chimeric RNA DNA analogue Inoue et al. 215 327 330 1987 .

Polynucleotides of the invention may be synthesized by standard methods known in the art e.g. by use of an automated DNA synthesizer such as are commercially available from Biosearch Applied Biosystems etc. . As examples phosphorothioate oligonucleotides may be synthesized by the method of Stein et al. 16 3209 1988 methylphosphonate oligonucleotides can be prepared by use of controlled pore glass polymer supports Sarin et al. 85 7448 7451 1988 etc.

Potential antagonists according to the invention also include catalytic RNA or a ribozyme See e.g. PCT

International Publication WO 90 11364 Sarver et al. 247 1222 1225 1990 . While ribozymes that cleave mRNA at site specific recognition sequences can be used to destroy TR17 mRNAs the use of hammerhead ribozymes is preferred. Hammerhead ribozymes cleave mRNAs at locations dictated by flanking regions that form complementary base pairs with the target mRNA. The sole requirement is that the target mRNA have the following sequence of two bases 5 UG 3 . The construction and production of hammerhead ribozymes is well known in the art and is described more fully in Haseloff and Gerlach 334 585 591 1988 . There are numerous potential hammerhead ribozyme cleavage sites within the nucleotide sequence of TR17 SEQ ID NO 1 . Preferably the ribozyme is engineered so that the cleavage recognition site is located near the 5 end of the TR17 mRNA i.e. to increase efficiency and minimize the intracellular accumulation of non functional mRNA transcripts.

As in the antisense approach the ribozymes of the invention can be composed of modified oligonucleotides e.g. for improved stability targeting etc. and should be delivered to cells which express TR17 in vivo. DNA constructs encoding the ribozyme may be introduced into the cell in the same manner as described above for the introduction of antisense encoding DNA. A preferred method of delivery involves using a DNA construct encoding the ribozyme under the control of a strong constitutive promoter such as for example pol III or pol II promoter so that transfected cells will produce sufficient quantities of the ribozyme to destroy endogenous TR17 messages and inhibit translation. Since ribozymes unlike antisense molecules are catalytic a lower intracellular concentration is required for efficiency.

Endogenous gene expression can also be reduced by inactivating or knocking out the TR17 gene and or its promoter using targeted homologous recombination. E.g. see Smithies et al. 317 230 234 1985 Thomas Capecchi 51 503 512 1987 Thompson et al. 5 313 321 1989 each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . For example a mutant non functional polynucleotide of the invention or a completely unrelated DNA sequence flanked by DNA homologous to the endogenous polynucleotide sequence either the coding regions or regulatory regions of the gene can be used with or without a selectable marker and or a negative selectable marker to transfect cells that express polypeptides of the invention in vivo. In another embodiment techniques known in the art are used to generate knockouts in cells that contain but do not express the gene of interest. Insertion of the DNA construct via targeted homologous recombination results in inactivation of the targeted gene. Such approaches are particularly suited in research and agricultural fields where modifications to embryonic stem cells can be used to generate animal offspring with an inactive targeted gene e.g. see Thomas Capecchi 1987 and Thompson 1989 supra . However this approach can be routinely adapted for use in humans provided the recombinant DNA constructs are directly administered or targeted to the required site in vivo using appropriate viral vectors that will be apparent to those of skill in the art. The contents of each of the documents recited in this paragraph is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The techniques of gene shuffling motif shuffling exon shuffling and or codon shuffling collectively referred to as DNA shuffling may be employed to modulate the activities of TR17 thereby effectively generating agonists and antagonists of TR17. See generally International Publication No. WO 99 29902 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 605 793 5 811 238 5 830 721 5 834 252 and 5 837 458 and Patten et al. 8 724 33 1997 Harayama 16 2 76 82 1998 Hansson et al. 287 265 76 1999 and Lorenzo and Blasco 24 2 308 13 1998 each of these patents and publications are hereby incorporated by reference . In one embodiment alteration of TR17 polynucleotides and corresponding polypeptides may be achieved by DNA shuffling. DNA shuffling involves the assembly of two or more DNA segments into a desired TR17 molecule by homologous or site specific recombination.

In other embodiments antagonists according to the present invention include soluble forms of TR17 e.g. fragments of the TR17 shown in SEQ ID NO 2 that include one or more of the cysteine rich domains from the extracellular region of the full length receptor . Such soluble forms of the TR17 which may be naturally occurring or synthetic antagonize TR17 mediated signaling by competing with the cell surface bound forms of the receptor for binding to TNF family ligands. Antagonists of the present invention also include antibodies specific for TNF family ligands and TR17 Fc fusion proteins.

By a TNF family ligand is intended naturally occurring recombinant and synthetic ligands that are capable of binding to a member of the TNF receptor family and inducing and or blocking the ligand receptor signaling pathway. Members of the TNF ligand family include but are not limited to TNF alpha lymphotoxin alpha LT alpha also known as TNF beta LT beta found in complex heterotrimer LT alpha2 beta OPGL FasL CD27L CD30L CD40L 4 1BBL DcR3 OX40L TNF gamma International Publication No. WO 96 14328 TRAIL AIM II International Publication No. WO 97 34911 APRIL International Publication Number WO 97 33902188 6 1185 1190 1998 endokine alpha International Publication No. WO 98 07880 Neutrokine alpha International Publication No. WO98 18921 OPG OX40 and nerve growth factor NGF and soluble forms of Fas CD30 CD27 CD40 and 4 IBB TR2 International Publication No. WO 96 34095 DR3 International Publication No. WO 97 33904 DR4 International Publication No. WO 98 32856 TR5 International Publication No. WO 98 30693 TR6 International Publication No. WO 98 30694 TR7 International Publication No. WO 98 41629 TRANK TR9 International Publication No. WO 98 56892 312C2 International Publication No. WO 98 06842 and TR12 and soluble forms CD154 CD70 and CD153. In specific embodiments the TNF family ligand is Neutrokine alpha or fragments or variants thereof. In another specific embodiment the TNF family ligand is APRIL or fragments or variants thereof.

TNF has been shown to protect mice from infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 HSV 1 . Rossol Voth et al. J. Gen. Virol. 72 143 147 1991 . The mechanism of the protective effect of TNF is unknown but appears to involve neither interferons nor NK cell killing. One member of the family has been shown to mediate HSV 1 entry into cells. Montgomery et al. 7 159 1996 . Further antibodies specific for the extracellular domain of this block HSV 1 entry into cells. Thus TR17 antagonists of the present invention include both TR17 amino acid sequences and antibodies capable of preventing mediated viral entry into cells. Such sequences and antibodies can function by either competing with cell surface localized for binding to virus or by directly blocking binding of virus to cell surface receptors.

Antibodies according to the present invention may be prepared by any of a variety of methods using TR17 antigens e.g. immunogens of the present invention. As indicated such TR17 antigens include the full length TR17 polypeptide which may or may not include the leader sequence and TR17 polypeptide fragments such as the extracellular domain the cysteine rich domain one or more of the TR17 cysteine rich domains the transmembrane domain and the intracellular domain or any combination thereof.

Polyclonal and monoclonal antibody agonists or antagonists according to the present invention can be raised according to the methods disclosed herein and or known in the art such as for example those methods described in Tartaglia and Goeddel 267 7 4304 4307 1992 Tartaglia et al. 73 213 216 1993 and PCT Application WO 94 09137 the contents of each of these three publications are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties and are preferably specific to TR17 polypeptides of the invention having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 2.

Antagonists according to the present invention include soluble forms of TR17 i.e. TR17 fragments that include one or more of the cytsteine rich domains from the extracellular region of the full length receptor. Such soluble forms of the receptor which may be naturally occurring or synthetic antagonize TR17 mediated signaling by competing with the cell surface TR17 for binding to TNF family ligands. Thus soluble forms of the receptor that include tone or more of the cysteine rich motifs of TR17 are novel cytokines capable of inhibiting TR17 mediated signaling induced by TNF family ligands. These soluble forms are preferably expressed as dimers or trimers since these have been shown to be superior to monomeric forms of soluble receptor as antagonists e.g. IgGFc TNF receptor family fusions. Other such cytokines are known in the art and include Fas B a soluble form of the mouse Fas receptor that acts physiologically to limit apoptosis induced by Fas ligand D. P. Hughes and I. N. Crispe 182 1395 1401 1995 .

Proteins and other compounds which bind the TR17 domains are also candidate agonists and antagonists according to the present invention. Such binding compounds can be captured using the yeast two hybrid system Fields and Song 340 245 246 1989 . A modified version of the yeast two hybrid system has been described by Roger Brent and his colleagues J. Gyuris 75 791 803 1993 A. S. Zervos et al. 72 223 232 1993 . Preferably the yeast two hybrid system is used according to the present invention to capture compounds which bind to either one or more of the TR17 extracellular rich motifs or to the TR17 intracellular domain. Such compounds are good candidate agonists and antagonists of the present invention.

The agonist or antagonists described herein can be administered in vitro ex vivo or in vivo to cells which express the receptor of the present invention. By administration of an effective amount of an agonist or antagonist is intended an amount of the compound that is sufficient to enhance or inhibit a cellular response to a TNF family. One of ordinary skill will appreciate that effective amounts of an agonist or antagonist can be determined empirically and may be employed in pure form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt ester or prodrug form. The agonist or antagonist may be administered in compositions in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.

It will be understood that when administered to a human patient the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon factors well known in the medical arts.

As a general proposition the total pharmaceutically effective amount of TR17 polypeptide administered parenterally per dose will be in the range of about 1 ug kg day to 10 mg kg day of patient body weight although as noted above this will be subject to therapeutic discretion. More preferably this dose is at least 0.01 mg kg day and most preferably for humans between about 0.01 and 1 mg kg day for the hormone. If given continuously the TR17 polypeptide is typically administered at a dose rate of about 1 ug kg hour to about 50 ug kg hour either by 1 4 injections per day or by continuous subcutaneous infusions for example using a mini pump. An intravenous bag solution may also be employed.

Dosaging may also be arranged in a patient specific manner to provide a predetermined concentration of an agonist or antagonist in the blood as determined by the RIA technique. Thus patient dosaging may be adjusted to achieve regular on going trough blood levels as measured by RIA on the order of from 50 to 1000 ng ml preferably 150 to 500 ng ml.

Pharmaceutical compositions containing the TR17 polypeptide of the invention may be administered orally rectally parenterally intracistemally intravaginally intraperitoneally topically as by powders ointments drops or transdermal patch bucally or as an oral or nasal spray. By pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is meant a non toxic solid semisolid or liquid filler diluent encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. The term parenteral as used herein refers to modes of administration which include intravenous intramuscular intraperitoneal intrasternal subcutaneous and intraarticular injection and infusion.

Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention for parenteral injection can comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions dispersions suspensions or emulsions as well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use. The composition if desired can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents or pH buffering agents. These compositions can take the form of solutions suspensions emulsion tablets pills capsules powders sustained release formulations and the like.

In addition to soluble TR17 polypeptides TR17 polypeptides containing the transmembrane region can also be used when appropriately solubilized by including detergents such as CHAPS or NP 40 with buffer.

TR17 compositions of the invention are also suitably administered by sustained release systems. Suitable examples of sustained release compositions include suitable polymeric materials such as for example semi permeable polymer matrices in the form of shaped articles e.g. films or mirocapsules suitable hydrophobic materials for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil or ion exchange resins and sparingly soluble derivatives such as for example a sparingly soluble salt .

In additional preferred embodiments the compositions of the invention are administered in combination with hematopoietic growth factors. Hematopoietic growth factors that may be administered with the compositions of the invention included but are not limited to LEUKINE SARGRAMOSTIM and NEUPOGEN FILGRASTIM .

In additional embodiments the compositions of the invention are administered in combination with other therapeutic or prophylactic regimens such as for example radiation therapy.

In certain preferred embodiments in this regard the cDNA herein disclosed is used to clone genomic DNA of a TR17 receptor gene. This can be accomplished using a variety of well known techniques and libraries which generally are available commercially. The genomic DNA is then used for in situ chromosome mapping using well known techniques for this purpose.

In addition in some cases sequences can be mapped to chromosomes by preparing PCR primers preferably 15 25 bp from the cDNA. Computer analysis of the 3 untranslated region of the gene is used to rapidly select primers that do not span more than one exon in the genomic DNA thus complicating the amplification process. These primers are then used for PCR screening of somatic cell hybrids containing individual human chromosomes.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH of a cDNA clone to a metaphase chromosomal spread can be used to provide a precise chromosomal location in one step. This technique can be used with cDNA as short as 50 or 60 bp. For a review of this technique see Verma et al. Pergamon Press New York 1988 .

Once a sequence has been mapped to a precise chromosomal location the physical position of the sequence on the chromosome can be correlated with genetic map data. Such data are found for example in V. McKusick available on line through Johns Hopkins University Welch Medical Library. The relationship between genes and diseases that have been mapped to the same chromosomal region are then identified through linkage analysis coinheritance of physically adjacent genes .

Next it is necessary to determine the differences in the cDNA or genomic sequence between affected and unaffected individuals. If a mutation is observed in some or all of the affected individuals but not in any normal individuals then the mutation is likely to be the causative agent of the disease.

Having generally described the invention the same will be more readily understood by reference to the following examples which are provided by way of illustration and are not intended as limiting.

TR17 polypeptides of the invention are optionally fused to other proteins. These fusion proteins can be used for a variety of applications. For example fusion of TR17 polypeptides to His tag HA tag protein A IgG domains and maltose binding protein facilitates purification. See EP A 394 827 Traunecker et al. 331 84 86 1988 . Similarly fusion to IgG 1 IgG 3 and albumin increases the halflife time in vivo. Nuclear localization signals fused to TR17 polypeptides can target the protein to a specific subcellular localization while covalent heterodimer or homodimers can increase or decrease the activity of a fusion protein. Fusion proteins can also create chimeric molecules having more than one function. Finally fusion proteins can increase solubility and or stability of the fused protein compared to the non fused protein. All of the types of fusion proteins described above can be made using techniques known in the art or by using or routinely modifying the following protocol which outlines the fusion of a polypeptide to an IgG molecule.

Briefly the human Fc portion of the IgG molecule can be PCR amplified using primers that span the 5 and 3 ends of the sequence described below SEQ ID NO XX . These primers also preferably contain convenient restriction enzyme sites that will facilitate cloning into an expression vector preferably a mammalian expression vector.

For example if the pC4 Accession No. 209646 expression vector is used the human Fc portion can be ligated into the BamHI cloning site. Note that the 3 BamHI site should be destroyed. Next the vector containing the human Fc portion is re restricted with BamHI linearizing the vector and TR17 polynucleotide is ligated into this BamHI site. Note that the polynucleotide is cloned without a stop codon otherwise a fusion protein will not be produced.

If the naturally occurring signal sequence is used to produce the secreted protein pC4 does not need a second signal peptide. Alternatively if the naturally occurring signal sequence is not used the vector can be modified to include a heterologous signal sequence. See e.g. WO 96 34891. 

The antibodies of the present invention can be prepared by a variety of methods. See Current Protocols Chapter 2. As one example of such methods cells expressing TR17 polypeptides are administered to an animal to induce the production of sera containing polyclonal antibodies. Such polypeptide expressing cells are cultured in any suitable tissue culture medium preferably in Earle s modified Eagle s medium supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum inactivated at about 56 C. and supplemented with about 10 g l of nonessential amino acids about 1 000 U ml of penicillin and about 100 g ml of streptomycin.

In a preferred method a preparation of TR17 polypeptides is prepared and purified to render it substantially free of natural contaminants. Such a preparation is then introduced into an animal in order to produce polyclonal antisera of greater specific activity.

Monoclonal antibodies specific for TR17 polypeptides of the present invention are prepared using hybridoma technology. Kohler et al. 256 495 1975 Kohler et al. Eur. J. Immunol. 6 511 1976 Kohler et al. Eur. J. Immunol. 6 292 1976 Hammerling et al. in Monoclonal Antibodies and T Cell Hybridomas Elsevier N.Y. pp. 563 681 1981 . In general an animal preferably a mouse is immunized with TR17 polypeptides of the present invention or more preferably with a soluble form of TR17.

The splenocytes of such mice are extracted and fused with a suitable myeloma cell line. Any suitable myeloma cell line may be employed in accordance with the present invention however it is preferable to employ the parent myeloma cell line SP20 available from the ATCC . After fusion the resulting hybridoma cells are selectively maintained in HAT medium and then cloned by limiting dilution as described by Wands et al. Gastroenterology 80 225 232 1981 . The hybridoma cells obtained through such a selection are then assayed to identify clones which secrete antibodies capable of binding a TR17 polypeptide of the present invention.

Alternatively additional antibodies capable of binding to a TR17 polypeptide of the present invention can be produced in a two step procedure using anti idiotypic antibodies. Such a method makes use of the fact that antibodies are themselves antigens and therefore it is possible to obtain an antibody which binds to a second antibody. In accordance with this method protein specific antibodies are used to immunize an animal preferably a mouse. The splenocytes of such an animal are then used to produce hybridoma cells and the hybridoma cells are screened to identify clones which produce an antibody whose ability to bind to the TR17 specific antibody can be blocked by a TR17 polypeptide of the present invention. Such antibodies comprise anti idiotypic antibodies to the TR17 specific antibody and are used to immunize an animal to induce formation of further TR17 specific antibodies.

For in vivo use of antibodies in humans an antibody is humanized . Such antibodies can be produced using genetic constructs derived from hybridoma cells producing the monoclonal antibodies described above. Methods for producing chimeric and humanized antibodies are known in the art and are discussed herein. See for review Morrison Science 229 1202 1985 Oi et al. BioTechniques 4 214 1986 Cabilly et al.

b Isolation of Antibody Fragments Directed Against Polypeptides of the Present Invention from a Library of scFvs.

Naturally occurring V genes isolated from human PBLs are constructed into a large library of antibody fragments which contain reactivities against polypeptides of the present invention to which the donor may or may not have been exposed see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 885 793 incorporated herein in its entirety by reference .

A library of scFvs is constructed from the RNA of human PBLs as described in WO92 01047. To rescue phage displaying antibody fragments approximately 10harbouring the phagemid are used to inoculate 50 ml of 2 TY containing 1 glucose and 100 ug ml of ampicillin 2 TY AMP GLU and grown to an O.D. of 0.8 with shaking. Five ml of this culture is used to innoculate 50 ml of 2 TY AMP GLU 2 10TU of gene 3 helper phage M13 gene III see WO92 01047 are added and the culture incubated at 37 C. for 45 minutes without shaking and then at 37 C. for 45 minutes with shaking. The culture is centrifuged at 4000 r.p.m. for 10 minutes and the pellet resuspended in 2 liters of 2 TY containing 100 ug ml ampicillin and 50 ug ml kanamycin and grown overnight. Phage are prepared as described in WO92 01047.

M13 gene III is prepared as follows M13 gene III helper phage does not encode gene III protein hence the phage mid displaying antibody fragments have a greater avidity of binding to antigen. Infectious M13 gene III particles are made by growing the helper phage in cells harboring a pUC19 derivative supplying the wild type gene III protein during phage morphogenesis. The culture is incubated for 1 hour at 37 C. without shaking and then for a further hour at 37 C. with shaking. Cells are pelleted IEC Centra 8 4000 revs min for 10 min resuspended in 300 ml 2 TY broth containing 100 ug ampicillin ml and 25 ug kanamycin ml 2 TY AMP KAN and grown overnight shaking at 37 C. Phage particles are purified and concentrated from the culture medium by two PEG precipitations Sambrook et al. 1990 resuspended in 2 ml PBS and passed through a 0.45 um filter Minisart NML Sartorius to give a final concentration of approximately 10transducing units ml ampicillin resistant clones .

Immunotubes Nunc are coated overnight in PBS with 4 ml of either 100 mg ml or 10 mg ml of a polypeptide of the present invention. Tubes are blocked with 2 Marvel PBS for 2 hours at 37 C. and then washed 3 times in PBS. Approximately 1013 TU of phage are applied to the tube and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature tumbling on an over and under turntable and then left to stand for another 1.5 hours. Tubes are washed 10 times with PBS 0.1 Tween 20 and 10 times with PBS. Phage are eluted by adding 1 ml of 100 mM triethylamine and rotating 15 minutes on an under and over turntable after which the solution is immediately neutralized with 0.5 ml of 1.0M Tris HCl pH 7.4. Phage are then used to infect 10 ml of mid log TG1 by incubating eluted phage with bacteria for 30 minutes at 37 C. The are then plated on TYE plates containing 1 glucose and 100 ug ml ampicillin. The resulting bacterial library is then rescued with A gene III helper phage as described above to prepare phage for a subsequent round of selection. This process is then repeated for a total of 4 rounds of affinity purification with tube washing increased to 20 times with PBS 0.1 Tween 20 and 20 times with PBS for rounds 3 and 4.

Eluted phage from the 3rd and 4th rounds of selection are used to infect HB 2151 and soluble scFv is produced Marks et al. 1991 from single colonies for assay. ELISAs are performed with microtitre plates coated with either 10 pg ml of the polypeptide of the present invention in 50 mM bicarbonate pH 9.6. Clones positive in ELISA are further characterized by PCR fingerprinting see e.g. WO92 01047 and then by sequencing.

RNA is isolated from entire families or individual patients presenting with a phenotype of interest such as a disease . cDNA is then generated from these RNA samples using protocols known in the art. See Sambrook. 

The cDNA is then used as a template for PCR employing primers surrounding regions of interest in SEQ ID NO 1. Suggested PCR conditions consist of 35 cycles at 95 C. for 30 seconds 60 120 seconds at 52 58 C. and 60 120 seconds at 70 C. using buffer solutions described in Sidransky D. et al 252 706 1991 .

PCR products are then sequenced using primers labeled at their 5 end with T4 polynucleotide kinase employing SequiTherm Polymerase. Epicentre Technologies . The intron exon borders of selected exons of TR17 are also determined and genomic PCR products analyzed to confirm the results. PCR products harboring suspected mutations in TR17 is then cloned and sequenced to validate the results of the direct sequencing.

PCR products of TR17 are cloned into T tailed vectors as described in Holton T. A. and Graham M. W. 19 1156 1991 and sequenced with T7 polymerase United States Biochemical . Affected individuals are identified by mutations in TR17 not present in unaffected individuals.

Genomic rearrangements are also observed as a method of determining alterations in the TR17 gene. Genomic clones isolated using techniques known in the art are nick translated with digoxigenindeoxy uridine 5 triphosphate Boehringer Manheim and FISH performed as described in Johnson Cg. et al. 35 73 99 1991 . Hybridization with the labeled probe is carried out using a vast excess of human cot 1 DNA for specific hybridization to the TR17 genomic locus.

Chromosomes are counterstained with 4 6 diamino 2 phenylidole and propidium iodide producing a combination of C and R bands. Aligned images for precise mapping are obtained using a triple band filter set Chroma Technology Brattleboro Vt. in combination with a cooled charge coupled device camera Photometrics Tucson Ariz. and variable excitation wavelength filters. Johnson Cv. et al. 8 75 1991 . Image collection analysis and chromosomal fractional length measurements are performed using the ISee Graphical Program System. Inovision Corporation Durham N.C. Chromosome alterations of the genomic region of TR17 hybridized by the probe are identified as insertions deletions and translocations. These TR17 alterations are used as a diagnostic marker for an associated disease.

TR17 polypeptides can be detected in a biological sample and if an increased or decreased level of TR17 is detected this polypeptide is a marker for a particular phenotype. Methods of detection are numerous and thus it is understood that one skilled in the art can modify the following assay to fit their particular needs.

For example antibody sandwich ELISAs are used to detect TR17 in a sample preferably a biological sample. Wells of a microtiter plate are coated with specific antibodies to TR17 at a final concentration of 0.2 to 10 ug ml. The antibodies are either monoclonal or polyclonal and are produced using technique known in the art. The wells are blocked so that non specific binding of TR17 to the well is reduced.

The coated wells are then incubated for 2 hours at RT with a sample containing TR17. Preferably serial dilutions of the sample should be used to validate results. The plates are then washed three times with deionized or distilled water to remove unbounded TR17.

Next 50 ul of specific antibody alkaline phosphatase conjugate at a concentration of 25 400 ng is added and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. The plates are again washed three times with deionized or distilled water to remove unbounded conjugate.

75 ul of 4 methylumbelliferyl phosphate MUP or p nitrophenyl phosphate NPP substrate solution is then added to each well and incubated 1 hour at room temperature to allow cleavage of the substrate and flourescence. The flourescence is measured by a microtiter plate reader. A standard curve is preparded using the experimental results from serial dilutions of a control sample with the sample concentration plotted on the X axis log scale and fluorescence or absorbance on the Y axis linear scale . The TR17 polypeptide concentration in a sample is then interpolated using the standard curve based on the measured flourescence of that sample.

The present invention relates to a method for treating an individual in need of a decreased level of TR17 biological activity in the body comprising administering to such an individual a composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of TR17 antagonist. Preferred antagonists for use in the present invention are TR17 specific antibodies.

Moreover it will be appreciated that conditions caused by a decrease in the standard or normal expression level of TR17 in an individual can be treated by administering TR17 preferably in a soluble and or secreted form. Thus the invention also provides a method of treatment of an individual in need of an increased level of TR17 polypeptide comprising administering to such an individual a pharmaceutical composition comprising an amount of TR17 to increase the biological activity level of TR17 in such an individual.

For example a patient with decreased levels of TR17 polypeptide receives a daily dose 0.1 100 ug kg of the polypeptide for six consecutive days. Preferably the polypeptide is in a soluble and or secreted form.

The present invention also relates to a method for treating an individual in need of an increased level of TR17 biological activity in the body comprising administering to such an individual a composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of TR17 or an agonist thereof.

Antisense technology is used to inhibit production of TR17. This technology is one example of a method of decreasing levels of TR17 polypeptide preferably a soluble and or secreted form due to a variety of etiologies such as cancer.

For example a patient diagnosed with abnormally increased levels of TR17 is administered intravenously antisense polynucleotides at 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 and 3.0 mg kg day for 21 days. This treatment is repeated after a 7 day rest period if the is determined to be well tolerated.

One method of gene therapy transplants fibroblasts which are capable of expressing soluble and or mature TR17 polypeptides onto a patient. Generally fibroblasts are obtained from a subject by skin biopsy. The resulting tissue is placed in tissue culture medium and separated into small pieces. Small chunks of the tissue are placed on a wet surface of a tissue culture flask approximately ten pieces are placed in each flask. The flask is turned upside down closed tight and left at room temperature over night. After 24 hours at room temperature the flask is inverted and the chunks of tissue remain fixed to the bottom of the flask and fresh media e.g. Ham s F12 media with 10 FBS penicillin and streptomycin is added. The flasks are then incubated at 37 C. for approximately one week.

At this time fresh media is added and subsequently changed every several days. After an additional two weeks in culture a monolayer of fibroblasts emerge. The monolayer is trypsinized and scaled into larger flasks.

pMV 7 Kirschmeier P. T. et al 7 219 25 1988 flanked by the long terminal repeats of the Moloney murine sarcoma virus is digested with EcoRI and HindIII and subsequently treated with calf intestinal phosphatase. The linear vector is fractionated on agarose gel and purified using glass beads.

The cDNA encoding TR17 can be amplified using PCR primers which correspond to the 5 and 3 end encoding sequences respectively. Preferably the 5 primer contains an EcoRI site and the 3 primer includes a HindIII site. Equal quantities of the Moloney murine sarcoma virus linear backbone and the amplified EcoRI and HindIII fragment are added together in the presence of T4 DNA ligase. The resulting mixture is maintained under conditions appropriate for ligation of the two fragments. The ligation mixture is then used to transform HB101 which are then plated onto agar containing kanamycin for the purpose of confirming that the vector contains properly inserted TR17.

The amphotropic pA317 or GP am12 packaging cells are grown in tissue culture to confluent density in Dulbecco s Modified Eagles Medium DMEM with 10 calf serum CS penicillin and streptomycin. The MSV vector containing the TR17 gene is then added to the media and the packaging cells transduced with the vector. The packaging cells now produce infectious viral particles containing the TR17 gene the packaging cells are now referred to as producer cells .

Fresh media is added to the transduced producer cells and subsequently the media is harvested from a 10 cm plate of confluent producer cells. The spent media containing the infectious viral particles is filtered through a millipore filter to remove detached producer cells and this media is then used to infect fibroblast cells. Media is removed from a sub confluent plate of fibroblasts and quickly replaced with the media from the producer cells. This media is removed and replaced with fresh media. If the titer of virus is high then virtually all fibroblasts will be infected and no selection is required. If the titer is very low then it is necessary to use a retroviral vector that has a selectable marker such as neo or his. Once the fibroblasts have been efficiently infected the fibroblasts are analyzed to determine whether TR17 protein is produced.

The engineered fibroblasts are then transplanted onto the host either alone or after having been grown to confluence on cytodex 3 microcarrier beads.

Another aspect of the present invention is using in vivo gene therapy methods to treat disorders diseases and conditions. The gene therapy method relates to the introduction of naked nucleic acid DNA RNA and antisense DNA or RNA TR17 sequences into an animal to increase or decrease the expression of the TR17 polypeptide. The TR17 polynucleotide may be operatively linked to a promoter or any other genetic elements necessary for the expression of the TR17 polypeptide by the target tissue. Such gene therapy and delivery techniques and methods are known in the art see for example WO90 11092 WO98 11779 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 693 622 5 705 151 5 580 859 Tabata H. et al. 35 470 479 1997 Chao J. et al. 35 517 522 1997 Wolff J. A. 7 314 318 1997 Schwartz B. et al. 3 405 411 1996 Tsurumi Y. et al. 94 3281 3290 1996 incorporated herein by reference .

The TR17 polynucleotide constructs may be delivered by any method that delivers injectable materials to the cells of an animal such as injection into the interstitial space of tissues heart muscle skin lung liver intestine and the like . The TR17 polynucleotide constructs can be delivered in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid or aqueous carrier.

The term naked polynucleotide DNA or RNA refers to sequences that are free from any delivery vehicle that acts to assist promote or facilitate entry into the cell including viral sequences viral particles liposome formulations LIPOFECTN or precipitating agents and the like. However the TR17 polynucleotides may also be delivered in liposome formulations such as those taught in Felgner P. L. et al. 772 126 139 1995 and Abdallah B. et al. 85 1 1 7 1995 which can be prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art.

The TR17 polynucleotide vector constructs used in the gene therapy method are preferably constructs that will not integrate into the host genome nor will they contain sequences that allow for replication. Any strong promoter known to those skilled in the art can be used for driving the expression of DNA. Unlike other gene therapies techniques one major advantage of introducing naked nucleic acid sequences into target cells is the transitory nature of the polynucleotide synthesis in the cells. Studies have shown that non replicating DNA sequences can be introduced into cells to provide production of the desired polypeptide for periods of up to six months.

The TR17 polynucleotide construct can be delivered to the interstitial space of tissues within the an animal including of muscle skin brain lung liver spleen bone marrow thymus heart lymph blood bone cartilage pancreas kidney gall bladder stomach intestine testis ovary uterus rectum nervous system eye gland and connective tissue. Interstitial space of the tissues comprises the intercellular fluid mucopolysaccharide matrix among the reticular fibers of organ tissues elastic fibers in the walls of vessels or chambers collagen fibers of fibrous tissues or that same matrix within connective tissue ensheathing muscle cells or in the lacunae of bone. It is similarly the space occupied by the plasma of the circulation and the lymph fluid of the lymphatic channels. Delivery to the interstitial space of muscle tissue is preferred for the reasons discussed below. They may be conveniently delivered by injection into the tissues comprising these cells. They are preferably delivered to and expressed in persistent non dividing cells which are differentiated although delivery and expression may be achieved in non differentiated or less completely differentiated cells such as for example stem cells of blood or skin fibroblasts. In vivo muscle cells are particularly competent in their ability to take up and express polynucleotides.

For the naked TR17 polynucleotide injection an effective dosage amount of DNA or RNA will be in the range of from about 0.05 g kg body weight to about 50 mg kg body weight. Preferably the dosage will be from about 0.005 mg kg to about 20 mg kg and more preferably from about 0.05 mg kg to about 5 mg kg. Of course as the artisan of ordinary skill will appreciate this dosage will vary according to the tissue site of injection. The appropriate and effective dosage of nucleic acid sequence can readily be determined by those of ordinary skill in the art and may depend on the condition being treated and the route of administration. The preferred route of administration is by the parenteral route of injection into the interstitial space of tissues. However other parenteral routes may also be used such as inhalation of an aerosol formulation particularly for delivery to lungs or bronchial tissues throat or mucous membranes of the nose. In addition naked TR17 polynucleotide constructs can be delivered to arteries during angioplasty by the catheter used in the procedure.

The dose response effects of injected TR17 polynucleotide in muscle in vivo is determined as follows. Suitable TR17 template DNA for production of mRNA coding for TR17 polypeptide is prepared in accordance with a standard recombinant DNA methodology. The template DNA which may be either circular or linear is either used as naked DNA or complexed with liposomes. The quadriceps muscles of mice are then injected with various amounts of the template DNA.

Five to six week old female and male Balb C mice are anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with 0.3 ml of 2.5 Avertin. A 1.5 cm incision is made on the anterior thigh and the quadriceps muscle is directly visualized. The TR17 template DNA is injected in 0.1 ml of carrier in a 1 cc syringe through a 27 gauge needle over one minute approximately 0.5 cm from the distal insertion site of the muscle into the knee and about 0.2 cm deep. A suture is placed over the injection site for future localization and the skin is closed with stainless steel clips.

After an appropriate incubation time e.g. 7 days muscle extracts are prepared by excising the entire quadriceps. Every fifth 15 um cross section of the individual quadriceps muscles is histochemically stained for TR17 protein expression. A time course for TR17 protein expression may be done in a similar fashion except that quadriceps from different mice are harvested at different times. Persistence of TR17 DNA in muscle following injection may be determined by Southern blot analysis after preparing total cellular DNA and HIRT supernatants from injected and control mice. The results of the above experimentation in mice can be use to extrapolate proper dosages and other treatment parameters in humans and other animals using TR17 naked DNA.

Another method of gene therapy according to the present invention involves operably associating the endogenous TR17 sequence with a promoter via homologous recombination as described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 670 issued Jun. 24 1997 International Publication Number WO 96 29411 International Publication Number WO 94 12650 Koller et al 86 8932 8935 1989 and Zijlstra et al 342 435 438 1989 . This method involves the activation of a gene which is present in the target cells but which is not expressed in the cells or is expressed at a lower level than desired. Polynucleotide constructs are made which contain a promoter and targeting sequences which are homologous to the 5 non coding sequence of endogenous TR17 flanking the promoter. The targeting sequence will be sufficiently near the 5 end of TR17 so the promoter will be operably linked to the endogenous sequence upon homologous recombination. The promoter and the targeting sequences can be amplified using PCR. Preferably the amplified promoter contains distinct restriction enzyme sites on the 5 and 3 ends. Preferably the 3 end of the first targeting sequence contains the same restriction enzyme site as the 5 end of the amplified promoter and the 5 end of the second targeting sequence contains the same restriction site as the 3 end of the amplified promoter.

The amplified promoter and the amplified targeting sequences are digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and subsequently treated with calf intestinal phosphatase. The digested promoter and digested targeting sequences are added together in the presence of T4 DNA ligase. The resulting mixture is maintained under conditions appropriate for ligation of the two fragments. The construct is size fractionated on an agarose gel then purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation.

In this Example the polynucleotide constructs are administered as naked polynucleotides via electroporation. However the polynucleotide constructs may also be administered with transfection facilitating agents such as liposomes viral sequences viral particles precipitating agents etc. Such methods of delivery are known in the art.

Once the cells are transfected homologous recombination will take place which results in the promoter being operably linked to the endogenous TR17 sequence. This results in the expression of TR17 in the cell. Expression may be detected by immunological staining or any other method known in the art.

Fibroblasts are obtained from a subject by skin biopsy. The resulting tissue is placed in DMEM 10 fetal calf serum. Exponentially growing or early stationary phase fibroblasts are trypsinized and rinsed from the plastic surface with nutrient medium. An aliquot of the cell suspension is removed for counting and the remaining cells are subjected to centrifugation. The supernatant is aspirated and the pellet is resuspended in 5 ml of electroporation buffer 20 mM HEPES pH 7.3 137 mM NaCl 5 mM KCl 0.7 mM Na2 HPO4 6 mM dextrose . The cells are recentrifuged the supernatant aspirated and the cells resuspended in electroporation buffer containing 1 mg ml acetylated bovine serum albumin. The final cell suspension contains approximately 3 10cells ml. Electroporation should be performed immediately following resuspension.

Plasmid DNA is prepared according to standard techniques. For example to construct a plasmid for targeting to the TR17 locus plasmid pUC18 MBI Fermentas Amherst N.Y. is digested with HindIII. The CMV promoter is amplified by PCR with an XbaI site on the 5 end and a BamHI site on the 3 end. Two TR17 non coding sequences are amplified via PCR one TR17 non coding sequence TR17 fragment 1 is amplified with a HindIII site at the 5 end and an Xba site at the 3 end the other TR17 non coding sequence TR17 fragment 2 is amplified with a BamHI site at the 5 end and a HindIII site at the 3 end. The CMV promoter and TR17 fragments are digested with the appropriate enzymes CMV promoter XbaI and BamHI TR17 fragment 1 XbaI TR17 fragment 2 BamHI and ligated together. The resulting ligation product is digested with HindIII and ligated with the HindIII digested pUC18 plasmid.

Plasmid DNA is added to a sterile cuvette with a 0.4 cm electrode gap Bio Rad . The final DNA concentration is generally at least 120 g ml. 0.5 ml of the cell suspension containing approximately 1.5. 10cells is then added to the cuvette and the cell suspension and DNA solutions are gently mixed. Electroporation is performed with a Gene Pulser apparatus Bio Rad . Capacitance and voltage are set at 960 F and 250 300 V respectively. As voltage increases cell survival decreases but the percentage of surviving cells that stably incorporate the introduced DNA into their genome increases dramatically. Given these parameters a pulse time of approximately 14 20 mSec should be observed.

Electroporated cells are maintained at room temperature for approximately 5 min and the contents of the cuvette are then gently removed with a sterile transfer pipette. The cells are added directly to 10 ml of prewarmed nutrient media DMEM with 15 calf serum in a 10 cm dish and incubated at 37 C. The following day the media is aspirated and replaced with 10 ml of fresh media and incubated for a further 16 24 hours.

The engineered fibroblasts are then injected into the host either alone or after having been grown to confluence on cytodex 3 microcarrier beads. The fibroblasts now produce the protein product. The fibroblasts can then be introduced into a patient as described above.

Bioassay for the Effect of TR17 Polypeptides Agonists or Antagonists on Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells and or Differentiation

Mouse bone marrow cells are used as target cells to examine the effect of TR17 polypeptides of the invention on hematopoietic progenitor cells and or differentiation. Briefly unfractionated bone marrow cells are first washed 2 with a serum free IMDM that is supplemented with 10 V V BIT Bovine serum albumin Insulin and Transferrin supplement from Stem Cell Technologies Vancouver Canada . The washed cells are then resuspended in the same growth medium and plated in the 96 well tissue culture plate 5 10cells well in 0.2 ml of the above medium in the presence or absence of cytokines and TR17. Stem cell factor SCF and IL 3 are included as positive mediators of cell proliferation. Cells are allowed to grow in a low oxygen environment 5 CO 7 O and 88 N tissue culture incubator for 6 days. On the sixth day 0.5 Ci of Tritiated thymidine is added to each well and incubation is continued for an additional 16 18 hours at which point the cells are harvested. The level of radioactivity incorporated into cellular DNA is determined by scintillation spectrometry and reflects the amount of cell proliferation.

The studies described in this example test the activity of TR17 polypeptides of the invention. However one skilled in the art could easily modify the exemplified studies to test the activity of TR17 polynucleotides e.g. gene therapy agonists and or antagonists of TR17. Potential agonists would be expected to inhibit hematopoietic cell proliferation in the presence of SCF and or IL3 and or to increase the inhibition of cell proliferation in the presence of cytokines and TR17 in this assay. Potential antagonists would be expected to reduce the inhibition of cell proliferation in the presence of cytokines and TR17 in this assay.

However one skilled in the art could easily modify the exemplified studies to test the activity of TR17 polynucleotides e.g. gene therapy agonists and or antagonists of TR17. Potential agonists tested in this assay would be expected to inhibit cell proliferation in the presence of cytokines and or to increase the inhibition of cell proliferation in the presence of cytokines and TR17. Potential antagonists tested in this assay would be expected to reduce the inhibition of cell proliferation in the presence of cytokines and TR17.

Effect of TR17 on IL 3 and SCF Stimulated Proliferation and Differentiation of Lin population of Bone Marrow Cells

A population of mouse bone marrow cells enriched in primitive hematopoietic progenitors can be obtained using a negative selection procedure where the committed cells of most of the lineages are removed using a panel of monoclonal antibodies anti cd11b CD4 CD8 CD45R and Gr 1 antigens and magnetic beads. The resulting population of cells lineage depleted cells are plated 5 10cells ml in the presence or absence of TR17 polypeptide of the invention in a range of concentrations in a growth medium supplemented with IL 3 5 ng ml plus SCF 100 ng ml . After seven days of incubation at 37 C. in a humidified incubator 5 CO 7 O and 88 Nenvironment cells are harvested and assayed for the HPP CFC and immature progenitors. In addition cells are analyzed for the expression of certain differentiation antigens by FACScan. Colony data is expressed as mean number of colonies SD and are obtained from assays performed in six dishes for each population of cells.

Generation of functional humoral immune responses requires both soluble and cognate signaling between B lineage cells and their microenvironment. Signals may impart a positive stimulus that allows a B lineage cell to continue its programmed development or a negative stimulus that instructs the cell to arrest its current developmental pathway. To date numerous stimulatory and inhibitory signals have been found to influence B cell responsiveness including IL 2 IL 4 IL5 IL6 IL 7 IL10 IL 13 IL14 and IL15. Interestingly these signals are by themselves weak effectors but can in combination with various co stimulatory proteins induce activation proliferation differentiation homing tolerance and death among B cell populations. One of the best studied classes of B cell co stimulatory proteins is the TNF superfamily. Within this family CD40 CD27 and CD30 along with their respective ligands CD154 CD70 and CD153 have been found to regulate a variety of immune responses. Assays which allow for the detection and or observation of the proliferation and differentiation of these B cell populations and their precursors are valuable tools in determining the effects various proteins may have on these B cell populations in terms of proliferation and differentiation. Listed below are two assays designed to allow for the detection of the differentiation proliferation or inhibition of B cell populations and their precursors.

a. In Vitro assay Purified TR17 polypeptides of the invention e.g. soluble TR17 or agonists or antagonists thereof is assessed for its ability to induce activation proliferation differentiation or inhibition and or death in B cell populations and their precursors. The activity of TR17 polypeptides or agonists or antagonists thereof on purified human tonsillar B cells measured qualitatively over the dose range from 0.1 to 10 000 ng ml is assessed in a standard B lymphocyte co stimulation assay in which purified tonsillar B cells are cultured in the presence of either formalin fixed Cowan I SAC or immobilized anti human IgM antibody as the priming agent. Second signals such as IL 2 and IL 15 synergize with SAC and IgM crosslinking to elicit B cell proliferation as measured by tritiated thymidine incorporation. Novel synergizing agents can be readily identified using this assay. The assay involves isolating human tonsillar B cells by magnetic bead MACS depletion of CD3 positive cells. The resulting cell population is greater than 95 B cells as assessed by expression of CD45R B220 . Various dilutions of each sample are placed into individual wells of a 96 well plate to which are added 10B cells suspended in culture medium RPMI 1640 containing 10 FBS 5 10M ME 100 U ml penicillin 10 ug ml streptomycin and 10dilution of SAC in a total volume of 150 ul. Proliferation or inhibition is quantitated by a 20 h pulse 1 uCi well with H thymidine 6.7 Ci mM beginning 72 h post factor addition. The positive and negative controls are IL2 and medium respectively.

b. In Vivo assay BALB c mice are injected i.p. twice per day with buffer only or 2 mg Kg of TR17 polypeptide e.g. soluble TR17 or agonists or antagonists thereof. Mice receive this treatment for 4 consecutive days at which time they are sacrificed and various tissues and serum collected for analyses. Comparison of H E sections from normal and TR17 polypeptide treated spleens identify the results of the activity of TR17 polypeptide on spleen cells such as the diffusion of peri arterial lymphatic sheaths and or significant increases in the nucleated cellularity of the red pulp regions which may indicate the activation of the differentiation and proliferation of B cell populations. Immunohistochemical studies using a B cell marker anti CD45R B220 are used to determine whether any physiological changes to splenic cells such as splenic disorganization are due to increased B cell representation within loosely defined B cell zones that infiltrate established T cell regions.

Flow cytometric analyses of the spleens from TR17 polypeptide treated mice is used to indicate whether TR17 polypeptide specifically increases the proportion of ThB CD45R B220 dull B cells over that which is observed in control mice.

Likewise a predicted consequence of increased mature B cell representation in vivo is a relative increase in serum Ig titers. Accordingly serum IgM and IgA levels are compared between buffer and TR17 polypeptide treated mice.

The studies described in this example test the activity in TR17 polypeptide. However one skilled in the art could easily modify the exemplified studies to test the activity of TR17 polynucleotides e.g. gene therapy and agonists and or antagonists of TR17.

This example provides a co stimulatory assay using Cowan 1 SAC as priming agent and Neutrokine alpha International Application Publication No. WO 98 18921 or IL 2 as a second signal to assay for TR17 polypeptide antagonists of Neutrokine alpha or IL 2 mediated B cell proliferation.

A soluble TR17 polypeptide is prepared e.g. a soluble form of TR17 corresponding to a portion of the TR17 extracellular domain linked to the Fc portion of a human IgG1 immunogloulin molecule . The ability of this protein to alter the proliferative response of human B cells is assessed in a standard co stimulatory assay. Briefly human tonsillar B cells are purified by magnetic bead MACS depletion of CD3 positive cells. The resulting cell population is routinely greater than 95 B cells as assessed by expression of CD19 and CD20 staining. Various dilutions of rHuNeutrokine alpha International Application Publication No. WO 98 18921 or rHuIL2 are placed into individual wells of a 96 well plate to which is added 10B cells suspended in culture medium RPMI 1640 containing 10 FBS 5 10M 2ME 100 U ml penicillin 10 ug ml streptomycin and 10dilution of formalin fixed Cowan I SAC also known as Pansorbin Pan in a total volume of 150 ul. The TR17 polypeptide is then added at various concentrations and the plates are placed in the incubator 37 C. 5 CO 95 humidity for three days. Proliferation is quantitated by a 20 h pulse 1 Ci well of H thymidine 6.7 Ci mM beginning 72 h post factor addition. The positive and negative controls are SAC exposed B cells with rHuNeutrokine alpha or rHuIL2 and medium in the absence of the TR17 polypeptide respectively.

Antagonists of rHuNeutrokine alpha or rHuIL2 mediated B cell proliferation demonstrate a reduced level of B cell proliferation in the samples containing the TR17 polypeptides when compared to the positive control.

A CD3 induced proliferation assay is performed on PBMCs and is measured by the uptake of H thymidine. The assay is performed as follows. Ninety six well plates are coated with 100 l well of mAb to CD3 HIT3a Pharmingen or isotype matched control mAb B33.1 overnight at 4 C. 1 g ml in 0.05M bicarbonate buffer pH 9.5 then washed three times with PBS. PBMC are isolated by F H gradient centrifugation from human peripheral blood and added to quadruplicate wells 5 10 well of mAb coated plates in RPMI containing 10 FCS and P S in the presence of varying concentrations of TR17 protein total volume 200 l . Relevant protein buffer and medium alone are controls. After 48 hr. culture at 37 C. plates are spun for 2 min. at 1000 rpm and 100 l of supernatant is removed and stored 20 C. for measurement of IL 2 or other cytokines if effect on proliferation is observed. Wells are supplemented with 100 l of medium containing 0.5 Ci of H thymidine and cultured at 37 C. for 18 24 hr. Wells are harvested and incorporation of H thymidine used as a measure of proliferation. Anti CD3 alone is the positive control for proliferation. IL 2 100 U ml is also used as a control which enhances proliferation. Control antibody which does not induce proliferation of T cells is used as the negative controls for the effects of TR17 proteins.

The studies described in this example test the activity in TR17 protein. However one skilled in the art could easily modify the exemplified studies to test the activity of TR17 polynucleotides e.g. gene therapy agonists and or antagonists of TR17.

Effect of TR17 on the Expression of MHC Class II Costimulatory and Adhesion Molecules and Cell Differentiation of Monocytes and Monocyte Derived Human Dendritic Cells

Dendritic cells are generated by the expansion of proliferating precursors found in the peripheral blood adherent PBMC or elutriated monocytic fractions are cultured for 7 10 days with GM CSF 50 ng ml and IL 4 20 ng ml . These dendritic cells have the characteristic phenotype of immature cells expression of CD1 CD80 CD86 CD40 and MHC class II antigens . Treatment with activating factors such as TNF causes a rapid change in surface phenotype increased expression of MHC class I and II costimulatory and adhesion molecules downregulation of FC RII upregulation of CD83 . These changes correlate with increased antigen presenting capacity and with functional maturation of the dendritic cells.

FACS analysis of surface antigens is performed as follows. Cells are treated 1 3 days with increasing concentrations of TR17 or LPS positive control washed with PBS containing 1 BSA and 0.02 mM sodium azide and then incubated with 1 20 dilution of appropriate FITC or PE labeled monoclonal antibodies for 30 minutes at 4 C. After an additional wash the labeled cells are analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACScan Becton Dickinson .

Effect on the production of cytokines. Cytokines generated by dendritic cells in particular IL 12 are important in the initiation of T cell dependent immune responses. IL 12 strongly influences the development of Th1 helper T cell immune response and induces cytotoxic T and NK cell function. An ELISA is used to measure the IL 12 release as follows. Dendritic cells 10 ml are treated with increasing concentrations of TR17 for 24 hours. LPS 100 ng ml is added to the cell culture as positive control. Supernatants from the cell cultures are then collected and analyzed for IL 12 content using commercial ELISA kit e.g. R D Systems Minneapolis Minn. . The standard protocols provided with the kits are used.

Effect on the expression of MHC Class II costimulatory and adhesion molecules. Three major families of cell surface antigens can be identified on monocytes adhesion molecules molecules involved in antigen presentation and Fc receptor. Modulation of the expression of MHC class II antigens and other costimulatory molecules such as B7 and ICAM 1 may result in changes in the antigen presenting capacity of monocytes and ability to induce T cell activation. Increase expression of Fc receptors may correlate with improved monocyte cytotoxic activity cytokine release and phagocytosis.

FACS analysis is used to examine the surface antigens as follows. Monocytes are treated 1 5 days with increasing concentrations of TR17 or LPS positive control washed with PBS containing 1 BSA and 0.02 mM sodium azide and then incubated with 1 20 dilution of appropriate FITC or PE labeled monoclonal antibodies for 30 minutes at 4 C. After an additional wash the labeled cells are analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACScan Becton Dickinson .

Monocyte activation and or increased survival. Assays for molecules that activate or alternatively inactivate monocytes and or increase monocyte survival or alternatively decrease monocyte survival are known in the art and may routinely be applied to determine whether a molecule of the invention functions as an inhibitor or activator of monocytes. TR17 agonists or antagonists of TR17 can be screened using the three assays described below. For each of these assays Peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC are purified from single donor leukopacks American Red Cross Baltimore Md. by centrifugation through a HISTOPAQUE gradient SIGMA . Monocytes are isolated from PBMC by counterflow centrifugal elutriation.

1. Monocyte Survival Assay. Human peripheral blood monocytes progressively lose viability when cultured in absence of serum or other stimuli. Their death results from internally regulated process apoptosis . Addition to the culture of activating factors such as TNF alpha dramatically improves cell survival and prevents DNA fragmentation. Propidium iodide PI staining is used to measure apoptosis as follows. Monocytes are cultured for 48 hours in polypropylene tubes in serum free medium positive control in the presence of 100 ng ml TNF alpha negative control and in the presence of varying concentrations of the compound to be tested. Cells are suspended at a concentration of 2 10 ml in PBS containing PI at a final concentration of 5 g ml and then incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes before FAC Scan analysis. PI uptake has been demonstrated to correlate with DNA fragmentation in this experimental paradigm.

2. Effect on cytokine release. An important function of monocytes macrophages is their regulatory activity on other cellular populations of the immune system through the release of cytokines after stimulation. An ELISA to measure cytokine release is performed as follows. Human monocytes are incubated at a density of 5 10cells ml with increasing concentrations of TR17 and under the same conditions but in the absence of TR17. For IL 12 production the cells are primed overnight with IFN 100 U ml in presence of TR17. LPS 10 ng ml is then added. Conditioned media are collected after 24 h and kept frozen until use. Measurement of TNF IL 10 MCP 1 and IL 8 is then performed using a commercially available ELISA kit e.g. R D Systems Minneapolis Minn. applying the standard protocols provided with the kit.

3. Oxidative burst. Purified monocytes are plated in 96 well plate at 2 1 10cell well. Increasing concentrations of TR17 are added to the wells in a total volume of 0.2 ml culture medium RPMI 1640 10 FCS glutamine and antibiotics . After 3 days incubation the plates are centrifuged and the medium is removed from the wells. To the macrophage monolayers 0.2 ml per well of phenol red solution 140 mM NaCl 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 5.5 mM dextrose 0.56 mM phenol red and 19 U ml of HRPO is added together with the stimulant 200 nM PMA . The plates are incubated at 37 C. for 2 hours and the reaction is stopped by adding 20 l 1N NaOH per well. The absorbance is read at 610 nm. To calculate the amount of HOproduced by the macrophages a standard curve of a HOsolution of known molarity is performed for each experiment.

The studies described in this example test the activity in TR17 protein. However one skilled in the art could easily modify the exemplified studies to test the activity of TR17 polynucleotides e.g. gene therapy agonists and or antagonists of TR17.

On day 1 human umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVEC are seeded at 2 5 10cells 35 mm dish density in M199 medium containing 4 fetal bovine serum FBS 16 units ml heparin and 50 units ml endothelial cell growth supplements ECGS Biotechnique Inc. . On day 2 the medium is replaced with M199 containing 10 FBS 8 units ml heparin. TR17 protein of SEQ ID NO. 2 and positive controls such as VEGF and basic FGF bFGF are added at varying concentrations. On days 4 and 6 the medium is replaced. On day 8 cell number is determined with a Coulter Counter. An increase in the number of HUVEC cells indicates that TR17 may proliferate vascular endothelial cells.

For evaluation of mitogenic activity of growth factors the calorimetric MTS 3 4 5 dimethylthiazol 2 yl 5 3 carboxymethoxyphenyl 2 4 sulfophenyl 2H tetrazolium assay with the electron coupling reagent PMS phenazine methosulfate was performed CellTiter 96 AQ PROMEGA . Cells are seeded in a 96 well plate 5 000 cells well in 0.1 ml serum supplemented medium and are allowed to attach overnight. After serum starvation for 12 hours in 0.5 FBS conditions bFGF VEGFor TR17 in 0.5 FBS with or without Heparin 8 U ml are added to wells for 48 hours. 20 mg of MTS PMS mixture 1 0.05 are added per well and allowed to incubate for 1 hour at 37 C. before measuring the absorbance at 490 nm in an ELISA plate reader. Background absorbance from control wells some media no cells is subtracted and seven wells are performed in parallel for each condition. See Leak et al. 30A 512 518 1994 .

HAoSMC proliferation can be measured for example by BrdUrd incorporation. Briefly subconfluent quiescent cells grown on the 4 chamber slides are transfected with CRP or FITC labeled AT2 3LP. Then the cells are pulsed with 10 calf serum and 6 mg ml BrdUrd. After 24 h immunocytochemistry is performed by using BrdUrd Staining Kit Zymed Laboratories . In brief the cells are incubated with the biotinylated mouse anti BrdUrd antibody at 4 C. for 2 h after exposing to denaturing solution and then with the streptavidin peroxidase and diaminobenzidine. After counterstaining with hematoxylin the cells are mounted for microscopic examination and the BrdUrd positive cells are counted. The BrdUrd index is calculated as a percent of the BrdUrd positive cells to the total cell number. In addition the simultaneous detection of the BrdUrd staining nucleus and the FITC uptake cytoplasm is performed for individual cells by the concomitant use of bright field illumination and dark field UV fluorescent illumination. See Hayashida et al. 6 271 36 21985 21992 1996 .

This example will be used to explore the possibility that TR17 may stimulate lymphatic endothelial cell migration.

Endothelial cell migration assays are performed using a 48 well microchemotaxis chamber Neuroprobe Inc. Cabin John MD Falk W. Goodwin R. H. J. and Leonard E. J. A 48 well micro chemotaxis assembly for rapid and accurate measurement of leukocyte migration. 1980 33 239 247 . Polyvinylpyrrolidone free polycarbonate filters with a pore size of 8 um Nucleopore Corp. Cambridge Mass. are coated with 0.1 gelatin for at least 6 hours at room temperature and dried under sterile air. Test substances are diluted to appropriate concentrations in M199 supplemented with 0.25 bovine serum albumin BSA and 25 ul of the final dilution is placed in the lower chamber of the modified Boyden apparatus. Subconfluent early passage 2 6 HUVEC or BMEC cultures are washed and trypsinized for the minimum time required to achieve cell detachment. After placing the filter between lower and upper chamber 2.5 10cells suspended in 50 ul M199 containing 1 FBS are seeded in the upper compartment. The apparatus is then incubated for 5 hours at 37 C. in a humidified chamber with 5 CO2 to allow cell migration. After the incubation period the filter is removed and the upper side of the filter with the non migrated cells is scraped with a rubber policeman. The filters are fixed with methanol and stained with a Giemsa solution Diff Quick Baxter McGraw Park Ill. . Migration is quantified by counting cells of three random high power fields 40 in each well and all groups are performed in quadruplicate.

The studies described in this example test the activity in TR17 protein. However one skilled in the art could easily modify the exemplified studies to test the activity of TR17 polynucleotides e.g. gene therapy agonists and or antagonists of TR17.

Nitric oxide released by the vascular endothelium is believed to be a mediator of vascular endothelium relaxation. Thus TR17 activity can be assayed by determining nitric oxide production by endothelial cells in response to TR17.

Nitric oxide is measured in 96 well plates of confluent microvascular endothelial cells after 24 hours starvation and a subsequent 4 hr exposure to various levels of a positive control such as VEGF 1 and TR17. Nitric oxide in the medium is determined by use of the Griess reagent to measure total nitrite after reduction of nitric oxide derived nitrate by nitrate reductase. The effect of TR17 on nitric oxide release is examined on HUVEC.

Briefly NO release from cultured HUVEC monolayer is measured with a NO specific polarographic electrode connected to a NO meter Iso NO World Precision Instruments Inc. . Calibration of the NO element is performed according to the following equation 2 KNO2 2 KI 2H2SO4 6 2 NO I2 2H2O 2 K2SO4

The standard calibration curve is obtained by adding graded concentrations of KNO2 0 5 10 25 50 100 250 and 500 nmol L into the calibration solution containing K1 and H2SO4. The specificity of the Iso NO electrode to NO is previously determined by measurement of NO from authentic NO gas. The culture medium is removed and HUVECs are washed twice with Dulbecco s phosphate buffered saline. The cells are then bathed in 5 ml of filtered Krebs Henseleit solution in 6 well plates and the cell plates are kept on a slide warmer Lab Line Instruments Inc. to maintain the temperature at 37 C. The NO sensor probe is inserted vertically into the wells keeping the tip of the electrode 2 mm under the surface of the solution before addition of the different conditions. S nitroso acetyl penicillamin SNAP is used as a positive control. The amount of released NO is expressed as picomoles per 1 10endothelial cells. All values reported are means of four to six measurements in each group number of cell culture wells . See Leak et al. 217 96 105 1995 .

The studies described in this example test the activity in TR17 protein. However one skilled in the art could easily modify the exemplified studies to test the activity of TR17 polynucleotides e.g. gene therapy agonists and or antagonists of TR17.

Another step in angiogenesis is cord formation marked by differentiation of endothelial cells. This bioassay measures the ability of microvascular endothelial cells to form capillary like structures hollow structures when cultured in vitro.

CADMEC microvascular endothelial cells are purchased from Cell Applications Inc. as proliferating passage 2 cells and are cultured in Cell Applications CADMEC Growth Medium and used at passage 5. For the in vitro angiogenesis assay the wells of a 48 well cell culture plate are coated with Cell Applications Attachment Factor Medium 200 l well for 30 min. at 37 C. CADMEC are seeded onto the coated wells at 7 500 cells well and cultured overnight in Growth Medium. The Growth Medium is then replaced with 300 g Cell Applications Chord Formation Medium containing control buffer or TR17 0.1 to 100 ng ml and the cells are cultured for an additional 48 hr. The numbers and lengths of the capillary like chords are quantitated through use of the Boeckeler VIA 170 video image analyzer. All assays are done in triplicate.

Commercial R D VEGF 50 ng ml is used as a positive control. b estradiol 1 ng ml is used as a negative control. The appropriate buffer without protein is also utilized as a control.

The studies described in this example test the activity in TR17 protein. However one skilled in the art could easily modify the exemplified studies to test the activity of TR17 polynucleotides e.g. gene therapy agonists and or antagonists of TR17.

Chick chorioallantoic membrane CAM is a well established system to examine angiogenesis. Blood vessel formation on CAM is easily visible and quantifiable. The ability of TR17 to stimulate angiogenesis in CAM can be examined.

Fertilized eggs of the White Leghorn chick and the Japanese quail are incubated at 37.8 C. and 80 humidity. Differentiated CAM of 16 day old chick and 13 day old quail embryos is studied with the following methods.

On Day 4 of development a window is made into the egg shell of chick eggs. The embryos are checked for normal development and the eggs sealed with cellotape. They are further incubated until Day 13. THERMANOX coverslips Nunc Naperville Ill. are cut into disks of about 5 mm in diameter. Sterile and salt free growth factors and the protein to be tested are dissolved in distilled water and about 3.3 mg 5 ml are pipetted on the disks. After air drying the inverted disks are applied on CAM. After 3 days the specimens are fixed in 3 glutaraldehyde and 2 formaldehyde and rinsed in 0.12 M sodium cacodylate buffer. They are photographed with a stereo microscope Wild M8 and embedded for semi and ultrathin sectioning as described above. Controls are performed with carrier disks alone.

The studies described in this example test the activity in TR17 protein. However one skilled in the art could easily modify the exemplified studies to test the activity of TR17 polynucleotides e.g. gene therapy agonists and or antagonists of TR17.

In order to establish an in vivo model for angiogenesis to test TR17 protein activities mice and rats are implanted subcutaneously with methylcellulose disks containing either 20 mg of BSA negative control 1 mg of TR17 or 0.5 mg of VEGF 1 positive control . The negative control disks should contain little vascularization while the positive control disks should show signs of vessel formation.

The studies described in this example test the activity in TR17 protein. However one skilled in the art could easily modify the exemplified studies to test the activity of TR17 polynucleotides e.g. gene therapy agonists and or antagonists of TR17.

To study the in vivo effects of TR17 on ischemia a rabbit hindlimb ischemia model is created by surgical removal of one femoral arteries as described previously Takeshita S. et al. 147 1649 1660 1995 . The excision of the femoral artery results in retrograde propagation of thrombus and occlusion of the external iliac artery. Consequently blood flow to the ischemic limb is dependent upon collateral vessels originating from the internal iliac artery Takeshita S. et al. 147 1649 1660 1995 . An interval of 10 days is allowed for post operative recovery of rabbits and development of endogenous collateral vessels. At 10 day post operatively day 0 after performing a baseline angiogram the internal iliac artery of the ischemic limb is transfected with 500 mg naked TR17 expression plasmid by arterial gene transfer technology using a hydrogel coated balloon catheter as described Riessen R. et al. 4 749 758 1993 Leclerc G. et al. 90 936 944 1992 . When TR17 is used in the treatment a single bolus of 500 mg TR17 protein or control is delivered into the internal iliac artery of the ischemic limb over a period of 1 min. through an infusion catheter. On day 30 various parameters are measured in these rabbits a BP ratio The blood pressure ratio of systolic pressure of the ischemic limb to that of normal limb b Blood Flow and Flow Reserve Resting FL the blood flow during undilated condition and Max FL the blood flow during fully dilated condition also an indirect measure of the blood vessel amount and Flow Reserve is reflected by the ratio of max FL resting FL c Angiographic Score This is measured by the angiogram of collateral vessels. A score is determined by the percentage of circles in an overlaying grid that with crossing opacified arteries divided by the total number m the rabbit thigh d Capillary density The number of collateral capillaries determined in light microscopic sections taken from hindlimbs.

The studies described in this example test the activity in TR17 protein. However one skilled in the art could easily modify the exemplified studies to test the activity of TR17 polynucleotides e.g. gene therapy agonists and or antagonists of TR17.

The evaluation parameters include skin blood flow skin temperature and factor VIII immunohistochemistry or endothelial alkaline phosphatase reaction. TR17 expression during the skin ischemia is studied using in situ hybridization.

Angiogenic therapy using TR17 is a novel therapeutic strategy to obtain restoration of blood flow around the ischemia in case of peripheral arterial diseases. The experimental protocol includes 

a One side of the femoral artery is ligated to create ischemic muscle of the hindlimb the other side of hindlimb serves as a control.

b TR17 protein in a dosage range of 20 mg 500 mg is delivered intravenously and or intramuscularly 3 times perhaps more per week for 2 3 weeks.

c The ischemic muscle tissue is collected after ligation of the femoral artery at 1 2 and 3 weeks for the analysis of TR17 expression and histology. Biopsy is also performed on the other side of normal muscle of the contralateral hindlimb.

The studies described in this example test the activity in TR17 protein. However one skilled in the art could easily modify the exemplified studies to test the activity of TR17 polynucleotides e.g. gene therapy agonists and or antagonists of TR17.

TR17 is evaluated as a potent mitogen capable of stimulating the development of collateral vessels and restructuring new vessels after coronary artery occlusion. Alteration of TR17 expression is investigated in situ. The experimental protocol includes 

a The heart is exposed through a left side thoracotomy in the rat. Immediately the left coronary artery is occluded with a thin suture 6 0 and the thorax is closed.

b TR17 protein in a dosage range of 20 mg 500 mg is delivered intravenously and or intramuscularly 3 times perhaps more per week for 2 4 weeks.

c Thirty days after the surgery the heart is removed and cross sectioned for morphometric and in situ analyzes.

To demonstrate that TR17 accelerates the healing process the genetically diabetic mouse model of wound healing is used. The full thickness wound healing model in the db db mouse is a well characterized clinically relevant and reproducible model of impaired wound healing. Healing of the diabetic wound is dependent on formation of granulation tissue and re epithelialization rather than contraction Gartner M. H. et al. 52 389 1992 Greenhalgh D. G. et al. 136 1235 1990 .

The diabetic animals have many of the characteristic features observed in Type II diabetes mellitus. Homozygous db db mice are obese in comparison to their normal heterozygous db m littermates. Mutant diabetic db db mice have a single autosomal recessive mutation on chromosome 4 db Coleman et al. 77 283 293 1982 . Animals show polyphagia polydipsia and polyuria. Mutant diabetic mice db db have elevated blood glucose increased or normal insulin levels and suppressed cell mediated immunity Mandel et al. 120 1375 1978 Debray Sachs M. et al. 51 1 1 7 1983 Leiter et al. 114 46 55 1985 . Peripheral neuropathy myocardial complications and microvascular lesions basement membrane thickening and glomerular filtration abnormalities have been described in these animals Norido F. et al. 83 2 221 232 1984 Robertson et al. 29 1 60 67 1980 Giacomelli et al. 40 4 460 473 1979 Coleman D. L. 31 Suppl 1 6 1982 . These homozygous diabetic mice develop hyperglycemia that is resistant to insulin analogous to human type II diabetes Mandel et al. 120 1375 1377 1978 .

The characteristics observed in these animals suggests that healing in this model may be similar to the healing observed in human diabetes Greenhalgh et al. 136 1235 1246 1990 .

Genetically diabetic female C57BL KsJ db db mice and their non diabetic db m heterozygous littermates are used in this study Jackson Laboratories . The animals are purchased at 6 weeks of age and were 8 weeks old at the beginning of the study. Animals are individually housed and received food and water ad libitum. All manipulations are performed using aseptic techniques. The experiments are conducted according to the rules and guidelines of Human Genome Sciences Inc. Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

Wounding protocol is performed according to previously reported methods Tsuboi R. and Rifkin D. B. 172 245 251 1990 . Briefly on the day of wounding animals are anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of Avertin 0.01 mg mL 2 2 2 tribromoethanol and 2 methyl 2 butanol dissolved in deionized water. The dorsal region of the animal is shaved and the skin washed with 70 ethanol solution and iodine. The surgical area is dried with sterile gauze prior to wounding. An 8 mm full thickness wound is then created using a Keyes tissue punch. Immediately following wounding the surrounding skin is gently stretched to eliminate wound expansion. The wounds are left open for the duration of the experiment. Application of the treatment is given topically for 5 consecutive days commencing on the day of wounding. Prior to treatment wounds are gently cleansed with sterile saline and gauze sponges.

Wounds are visually examined and photographed at a fixed distance at the day of surgery and at two day intervals thereafter. Wound closure is determined by daily measurement on days 1 5 and on day 8. Wounds are measured horizontally and vertically using a calibrated Jameson caliper. Wounds are considered healed if granulation tissue is no longer visible and the wound is covered by a continuous epithelium.

TR17 is administered using at a range different doses of TR17 from 4 mg to 500 mg per wound per day for 8 days in vehicle. Vehicle control groups received 50 mL of vehicle solution.

Animals are euthanized on day 8 with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital 300 mg kg . The wounds and surrounding skin are then harvested for histology and immunohistochemistry. Tissue specimens are placed in 10 neutral buffered formalin in tissue cassettes between biopsy sponges for further processing.

Three groups of 10 animals each 5 diabetic and 5 non diabetic controls are evaluated 1 Vehicle placebo control 2 TR17.

Wound closure is analyzed by measuring the area in the vertical and horizontal axis and obtaining the total square area of the wound. Contraction is then estimated by establishing the differences between the initial wound area day 0 and that of post treatment day 8 . The wound area on day 1 was 64 mm the corresponding size of the dermal punch. Calculations were made using the following formula Open area on day 8 Open area on day 1 Open area on day 1 

Specimens are fixed in 10 buffered formalin and paraffin embedded blocks are sectioned perpendicular to the wound surface 5 mm and cut using a Reichert Jung microtome. Routine hematoxylin eosin H E staining is performed on cross sections of bisected wounds. Histologic examination of the wounds are used to assess whether the healing process and the morphologic appearance of the repaired skin is altered by treatment with TR17. This assessment included verification of the presence of cell accumulation inflammatory cells capillaries fibroblasts re epithelialization and epidermal maturity Greenhalgh D. G. et al. 136 1235 1990 . A calibrated lens micrometer is used by a blinded observer.

Tissue sections are also stained immunohistochemically with a polyclonal rabbit anti human keratin antibody using ABC Elite detection system. Human skin is used as a positive tissue control while non immune IgG is used as a negative control. Keratinocyte growth is determined by evaluating the extent of reepithelialization of the wound using a calibrated lens micrometer.

Proliferating cell nuclear antigen cyclin PCNA in skin specimens is demonstrated by using anti PCNA antibody 1 50 with an ABC Elite detection system. Human colon cancer served as a positive tissue control and human brain tissue is used as a negative tissue control. Each specimen included a section with omission of the primary antibody and substitution with non immune mouse IgG. Ranking of these sections is based on the extent of proliferation on a scale of 0 8 the lower side of the scale reflecting slight proliferation to the higher side reflecting intense proliferation.

To demonstrate that TR17 can accelerate the healing process the effects of multiple topical applications of TR17 on full thickness excisional skin wounds in rats in which healing has been impaired by the systemic administration of methylprednisolone is assessed.

Young adult male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 250 300 g Charles River Laboratories are used in this example. The animals are purchased at 8 weeks of age and were 9 weeks old at the beginning of the study. The healing response of rats is impaired by the systemic administration of methylprednisolone 17 mg kg rat intramuscularly at the time of wounding. Animals are individually housed and received food and water ad libitum. All manipulations are performed using aseptic techniques. This study is conducted according to the rules and guidelines of Human Genome Sciences Inc. Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

The wounding protocol is followed according to section A above. On the day of wounding animals are anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of ketamine 50 mg kg and xylazine 5 mg kg . The dorsal region of the animal is shaved and the skin washed with 70 ethanol and iodine solutions. The surgical area is dried with sterile gauze prior to wounding. An 8 mm full thickness wound is created using a Keyes tissue punch. The wounds are left open for the duration of the experiment. Applications of the testing materials are given topically once a day for 7 consecutive days commencing on the day of wounding and subsequent to methylprednisolone administration. Prior to treatment wounds are gently cleansed with sterile saline and gauze sponges.

Wounds are visually examined and photographed at a fixed distance at the day of wounding and at the end of treatment. Wound closure is determined by daily measurement on days 1 5 and on day 8. Wounds are measured horizontally and vertically using a calibrated Jameson caliper. Wounds are considered healed if granulation tissue was no longer visible and the wound is covered by a continuous epithelium.

TR17 is administered using at a range different doses of TR17 from 4 mg to 500 mg per wound per day for 8 days in vehicle. Vehicle control groups received 50 mL of vehicle solution.

Animals are euthanized on day 8 with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital 300 mg kg . The wounds and surrounding skin are then harvested for histology. Tissue specimens are placed in 10 neutral buffered formalin in tissue cassettes between biopsy sponges for further processing.

Four groups of 10 animals each 5 with methylprednisolone and 5 without glucocorticoid were evaluated 1 Untreated group 2 Vehicle placebo control 3 TR17 treated groups.

Wound closure is analyzed by measuring the area in the vertical and horizontal axis and obtaining the total area of the wound. Closure is then estimated by establishing the differences between the initial wound area day 0 and that of post treatment day 8 . The wound area on day 1 was 64 mm the corresponding size of the dermal punch. Calculations were made using the following formula Open area on day 8 Open area on day 1 Open area on day 1 

Specimens are fixed in 10 buffered formalin and paraffin embedded blocks are sectioned perpendicular to the wound surface 5 mm and cut using an Olympus microtome. Routine hematoxylin eosin H E staining was performed on cross sections of bisected wounds. Histologic examination of the wounds allows assessment of whether the healing process and the morphologic appearance of the repaired skin was improved by treatment with TR17. A calibrated lens micrometer is used by a blinded observer to determine the distance of the wound gap.

The studies described in this example test the activity in TR17 protein. However one skilled in the art could easily modify the exemplified studies to test the activity of TR17 polynucleotides e.g. gene therapy agonists and or antagonists of TR17.

The purpose of this experimental approach is to create an appropriate and consistent lymphedema model for testing the therapeutic effects of TR17 in lymphangiogenesis and re establishment of the lymphatic circulatory system in the rat hind limb. Effectiveness is measured by swelling volume of the affected limb quantification of the amount of lymphatic vasculature total blood plasma protein and histopathology. Acute lymphedema is observed for 7 10 days. Perhaps more importantly the chronic progress of the edema is followed for up to 3 4 weeks.

Prior to beginning surgery blood sample is drawn for protein concentration analysis. Male rats weighing approximately 350 g are dosed with Pentobarbital. Subsequently the right legs are shaved from knee to hip. The shaved area is swabbed with gauze soaked in 70 EtOH. Blood is drawn for serum total protein testing. Circumference and volumetric measurements are made prior to injecting dye into paws after marking 2 measurement levels 0.5 cm above heel at mid pt of dorsal paw . The intradermal dorsum of both right and left paws are injected with 0.05 ml of 1 Evan s Blue. Circumference and volumetric measurements are then made following injection of dye into paws.

Using the knee joint as a landmark a mid leg inguinal incision is made circumferentially allowing the femoral vessels to be located. Forceps and hemostats are used to dissect and separate the skin flaps. After locating the femoral vessels the lymphatic vessel that runs along side and underneath the vessel s is located. The main lymphatic vessels in this area are then electrically coagulated or suture ligated.

Using a microscope muscles in back of the leg near the semitendinosis and adductors are bluntly dissected. The popliteal lymph node is then located.

The 2 proximal and 2 distal lymphatic vessels and distal blood supply of the popliteal node are then and ligated by suturing. The popliteal lymph node and any accompanying adipose tissue is then removed by cutting connective tissues.

Care is taken to control any mild bleeding resulting from this procedure. After lymphatics are occluded the skin flaps are sealed by using liquid skin Vetbond A J Buck . The separated skin edges are sealed to the underlying muscle tissue while leaving a gap of 0.5 cm around the leg. Skin also may be anchored by suturing to underlying muscle when necessary.

To avoid infection animals are housed individually with mesh no bedding . Recovering animals are checked daily through the optimal edematous peak which typically occurred by day 5 7. The plateau edematous peak are then observed. To evaluate the intensity of the lymphedema the circumference and volumes of 2 designated places on each paw before operation and daily for 7 days are measured. The effect plasma proteins on lymphedema is determined and whether protein analysis is a useful testing perimeter is also investigated. The weights of both control and edematous limbs are evaluated at 2 places. Analysis is performed in a blind manner.

Circumference Measurements Under brief gas anesthetic to prevent limb movement a cloth tape is used to measure limb circumference. Measurements are done at the ankle bone and dorsal paw by 2 different people then those 2 readings are averaged. Readings are taken from both control and edematous limbs.

Volumetric Measurements On the day of surgery animals are anesthetized with Pentobarbital and are tested prior to surgery. For daily volumetrics animals are under brief halothane anesthetic rapid immobilization and quick recovery both legs are shaved and equally marked using waterproof marker on legs. Legs are first dipped in water then dipped into instrument to each marked level then measured by Buxco edema software ChenVictor . Data is recorded by one person while the other is dipping the limb to marked area.

Blood plasma protein measurements Blood is drawn spun and serum separated prior to surgery and then at conclusion for total protein and Ca2 comparison.

Limb Weight Comparison After drawing blood the animal is prepared for tissue collection. The limbs were amputated using a quillitine then both experimental and control legs were cut at the ligature and weighed. A second weighing is done as the tibio cacaneal joint was disarticulated and the foot was weighed.

Histological Preparations The transverse muscle located behind the knee popliteal area is dissected and arranged in a metal mold filled with freezeGel dipped into cold methylbutane placed into labeled sample bags at 80EC until sectioning. Upon sectioning the muscle was observed under fluorescent microscopy for lymphatics. Other immuno histological methods are currently being evaluated.

The studies described in this example test the activity in TR17 protein. However one skilled in the art could easily modify the exemplified studies to test the activity of TR17 polynucleotides e.g. gene therapy agonists and or antagonists of TR17.

The results of this experiment confirmed that TR17 Fc inhibited B cell proliferation in the co stimulatory assay using Cowan 1 SAC as priming agent and Neutrokine alpha as a second signal data not shown . It is important to note that other Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptors TNFR fusion proteins e.g. DR4 Fc International Application Publication No. WO 98 32856 TR6 Fc International Application Publication No. WO 98 31799 and TR9 Fc International Application Publication No. WO 98 56892 did not inhibit proliferation.
