This application claims the benefit of the filing date of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61 037 097 filed on Mar. 17 2008 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.

This invention was made under U.S. Government Contract N00019 02 C 3002. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

In the drawings and description that follows like parts are marked throughout the specification and drawings with the same reference numerals respectively. The drawings are not necessarily to scale. Certain features of the invention may be shown exaggerated in scale or in somewhat schematic form and some details of conventional elements may not be shown in the interest of clarity and conciseness. The present invention is susceptible to embodiments of different forms. Specific embodiments are described in detail and are shown in the drawings with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered an exemplification of the principles of the invention and is not intended to limit the invention to that illustrated and described herein. It is to be fully recognized that the different teachings of the embodiments discussed below may be employed separately or in any suitable combination to produce desired results. The various characteristics mentioned above as well as other features and characteristics described in more detail below will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading the following detailed description of the embodiments and by referring to the accompanying drawings.

Referring initially to an exemplary embodiment of an electrode for EDM machining includes a pair of spaced apart vertical portions and and a horizontal portion extending between ends of the vertical portions. In an exemplary embodiment connection between the ends of the vertical portions and and the horizontal portion include radiused intermediate portions and . In an exemplary embodiment the electrode has a U shaped profile. Other profiles may also be provided for the electrode depending upon the desired volumetric shape of the cavity to be machined from a workpiece such as for example V shaped W shaped O shaped etc. . . .

The other ends of the electrode are connected to conventional machine grips and a conventional EDM machining motion control system . The general operation of EDM electrodes to machine material from a workpiece is considered well known to persons having ordinary skill in the art.

Referring to an exemplary embodiment of a method of operating the electrode to machine a workpiece will now be described.

As illustrated in the electrode is then displaced towards an outer surface of the workpiece using the grip . Continued movement of the electrode will bring the electrode into contact with the workpiece . As a result during operation of the electrode under the control of the EDM motion control system the electrode will machine material from the workpiece.

As illustrated in the electrode is then displaced further into the workpiece using the grip until a final desired depth of penetration is reached. As a result of the continued operation of the electrode under the control of the EDM motion control system the electrode will machine material from the workpiece in a region .

As illustrated in and the electrode may then be removed from the workpiece . As a result of the operation of the electrode under the control of the EDM motion control system a cavity is formed in the workpiece .

Referring now to the operation of the electrode under the control of the EDM motion control system may be modified by displacing the electrode in the Y and Z directions relative to the workpiece using the machine grip . As a result as illustrated in the electrode will machine material from the workpiece in a region . In an exemplary embodiment at least a portion of the material removed from the workpiece is removed intact. In this manner the material used in the workpiece may be recycled.

As illustrated in the electrode may then be removed from the workpiece . As a result of the operation of the electrode under the control of the EDM motion control system an elongated compound cavity is formed in the workpiece .

Referring now to the operation of the electrode under the control of the EDM motion control system may be modified by displacing the electrode in the Y direction relative to the workpiece and then rotating the electrode about an axis using the machine grip . As a result as illustrated in the electrode will machine material from the workpiece in a region .

As illustrated in and the electrode may then be removed from the workpiece . As a result of the operation of the electrode under the control of the EDM motion control system a cylindrical cavity is formed in the workpiece .

In several exemplary embodiments the electrode may be displaced relative to the workpiece by translating the electrode in or more direction and rotating the electrode about one or more axis to machine complex shaped cavities in the workpiece.

Referring to an exemplary embodiment of an electrode for EDM machining will now be described that includes a pair of spaced apart vertical electrodes and that define internal passages and respectively. In an exemplary embodiment the ends of the each of the vertical electrodes and radiused outer surfaces and and recessed portions and that house pulleys and . A conventional EDM wire passes through the passages and of the vertical electrodes and and extends in a horizontal direction between the radiused outer surfaces and and pulleys and of the vertical electrodes. In an exemplary embodiment the EDM wire remains in tension between the tips of the vertical electrodes and during the machining operation.

The other ends of the vertical electrodes and of the electrode are connected to conventional machine grips and and a conventional EDM motion control system . The general operation of EDM electrodes and wires to machine material from a workpiece is considered well known to persons having ordinary skill in the art.

In several exemplary embodiments each of the vertical electrodes and may be manipulated by a single grip or independently by a plurality of grips in order to create complex and or compound contours. In an exemplary embodiment the manipulation of the vertical electrodes and by a plurality of separate machine grips permits the creation of complex multi dimensional cavities in a workpiece. For example each of the vertical electrodes and may be manipulated by separate multi axis motion control systems such that the inclination depth and X Y location of the vertical electrodes may be simultaneously separately controlled.

In an exemplary embodiment the electrode under the control of the EDM motion control system may be operated as described above with reference to in order to machine one or more cavities in the workpiece .

In an exemplary embodiment prior to operation of the electrode a conventional EDM electrode or the EDM electrode may be used to machine an initial cavity that defines the greatest depth of the ultimate cavity to be formed.

In an exemplary embodiment a conventional EDM electrode or the EDM electrode may be used to machine a path within the workpiece for the vertical electrodes and to move through such that the EDM wire is used primarily for the final machining operation on the workpiece.

It is understood that variations may be made in the above without departing from the scope of the invention. For example the use of the EDM electrodes and of the present exemplary embodiments permit the machining of complex multi dimensional cavities in workpieces. Further spatial references are for the purpose of illustration only and do not limit the specific orientation or location of the structure described above. While specific embodiments have been shown and described modifications can be made by one skilled in the art without departing from the spirit or teaching of this invention. The embodiments as described are exemplary only and are not limiting. Many variations and modifications are possible and are within the scope of the invention. Accordingly the scope of protection is not limited to the embodiments described but is only limited by the claims that follow the scope of which shall include all equivalents of the subject matter of the claims.
