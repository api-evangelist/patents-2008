title: Systems and methods for absolute route diversity for mesh restorable connections
abstract: The present disclosure provides absolute route diversity (ARD) for mesh restorable sub-network connection protection (MR-SNCP) services. ARD addresses concerns in MR-SNCP by providing absolute path diversity between both paths (e.g., peer Sub Network Connections (SNCs)) of an MR-SNCP connection. If an ARD condition is not met, the peer SNC is not mesh restored and the MR-SNCP works with just one single SNC. The advantage of this approach is to reuse the bandwidth saved from ARD for other MR-SNCP, i.e. more efficient bandwidth utilization due to ARD for other MR-SNCPs, and better service quality guarantee (protection) in terms of planning and managing the network bandwidth.
