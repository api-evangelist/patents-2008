Power management for electronic devices such as computer systems play an important part in conserving energy managing heat dissipation and improving overall system performance. Modem computers systems are increasingly designed to be used in settings where a reliable external power supply is not available making power management to conserve energy important. Power management techniques allow certain components of a computer system to be powered down or put in a sleep mode that requires less power than while in active operation thereby reducing the total amount of energy consumed by a device over some period of time. Energy conservation is especially important for mobile devices to conserve battery power. Even when reliable external power supplies are available careful power management within the computing system can reduce heat produced by the system enabling improved performance of the system. Computing systems generally have better performance at lower ambient temperatures because key components can run at higher speeds without damaging their circuitry. Consequently there are many advantages to enhancing power management for electronic devices.

Various embodiments may be generally directed to techniques for performing communications based power management. Some embodiments may be particularly directed to performing power management techniques to manage power states for one portion of a node using power state information for another portion of a node. In one embodiment for example the power state information may be communicated over a communications bus and uniform interfaces between the various portions of a node using various power management messages. Examples for a node may include various types of heterogeneous network endpoint and infrastructure devices or resources such as computers servers switches routers bridges gateways and so forth. The power state information may indicate for example whether a portion of a given node is operating in a power managed state or a full computation state the duration for a power managed state a resume latency to exit from a power managed state and other power related characteristics for the given node. The power management techniques may be implemented for example by power gating and or clock gating various hardware elements of a node thereby conserving battery power.

Various embodiments provide several power management enhancements over conventional power management techniques. For example the input output I O architecture of the modern personal computer PC platform is essentially interrupt based in response to external events such as mouse movement and the arrival of network packets. The implication is the PC platform e.g. the I O controller host memory and chipset continuously remains in an active power state in order to service random interrupt I O requests. This is particularly true for interrupt I O requests from high speed communications devices e.g. Gigabit Ethernet which tend to be very bursty and non deterministic in nature. This type of power management design typically works well for performance driven I O devices because the platform is always active and waiting to service I O requests. Although the platform may periodically enter a lower power state and be capable waking up in time to service interrupts from slower devices e.g. a keyboard camera or mouse without any substantial performance issues this is not the case with high speed communications devices. Interrupts from high speed communications devices typically need relatively fast service on the order of several micro seconds otherwise the network packets may be dropped and network performance and throughput can be adversely affected. As a result the performance driven power management model is widely used. Although providing several performance advantages however such power management designs are inefficient and require a relative high level of power consumption especially when the platform is in an active power state but the communications elements are relative idle e.g. low network activity which is very typical of average users.

Various embodiments attempt to solve these and other problems. Some embodiments attempt to improve power management for a node by making high speed I O requests more deterministic so that a computer system can aggressively and proactively power gate and or clock gate portions of the computer system based on network traffic load. For example the computer system can manage power levels for computer system elements such as a central processing unit CPU memory controllers and other devices based on the network traffic workload. To accomplish this some embodiments utilize a parameterized communications device power management technique that interfaces with the platform power management architecture and conveys the idle duration resume latency and other communications power state information for the communications elements components modules sub systems or devices. Portions of the node can learn and benefit from network inactivity so that portions of the node can enter a lower power state and wake up right before the arrival of the next group of network packets. By managing one or more portions of a node based on network traffic workload considerations the node may realize enhanced energy conservation and utilize limited power resources such as batteries more efficiently.

In one embodiment a node may include a managed power system and a power management module to manage power states for the managed power system. The managed power system may comprise for example any devices components modules circuits or other portions of the node drawing power from a power source such as a battery. In one embodiment for example the managed power system may comprise a communications sub system and a computing sub system. The communications sub system may include a network state module operative to determine communications power state information. The communications power state information may include for example power states for the communications sub system as well as one or more parameters representing certain characteristics of the power states such as power state duration periods idle durations resume latencies and so forth. The network state module may send a power management message with the communications power state information. The power management module may be operative to communicate power state information with the communications sub system and the computing sub system utilizing various power management messages communicated over a communications bus and appropriate interfaces for the node. The power management module may receive the power management message retrieve the communications power state information from the power management message and manage power states for the computing sub system based on the communications power state information for the communications sub system. In this manner different portions of a node such as a network device may exchange negotiate and synchronize power state information to improve or enhance power state management for portions of the network device in order to facilitate energy conservation across the entire network device. Other embodiments may be described and claimed.

Various embodiments may comprise one or more elements. An element may comprise any structure arranged to perform certain operations. Each element may be implemented as hardware software or any combination thereof as desired for a given set of design parameters or performance constraints.

The nodes may also be arranged to communicate media information to include without limitation various types of image information audio information v.ideo information AV information and or other data provided from various media sources.

Although some of the nodes may comprise different network devices each of the nodes may include a common number of elements as shown by the node . For example the nodes may each include various power management elements to implement a power management scheme operative to perform power management operations for the nodes . In the illustrated embodiment shown in for example a first node may include a managed power system coupled to a power management module . The power management module may be operative to communicate power state information with a second node e.g. one of the nodes over a communications connection established via the communications links . In general operation the power management module may manage various power states for the managed power system of the first node . The power state information may include past present or future power states for one or more portions of a managed power system of the first node . In this manner the portions of a managed power system may exchange power state information to improve or enhance power state management for the first node . For example the power management module may synchronize power management operations between the sub systems of the managed power system such as placing computing components of the computing sub system in lower power states based on operations or anticipated operations for the communications components of the communications sub system for a given power state duration period.

Although the node is the only node shown in to include the managed power system and the power management module it may be appreciated that each of the nodes may include an identical or similar managed power system and power management module . For example the node may include a managed power system coupled to a power management module the node may include the elements and so forth. Furthermore the descriptions and examples of the structures and operations provided with reference to the managed power system and the power management module may also apply to the corresponding elements in the other nodes . Exemplary embodiments for the managed power system and the power management module may be described in more detail with reference to .

In various embodiments the managed power system may include any electrical or electronic elements of the nodes consuming power from the power source and suitable for power management operations. Power management techniques allow certain components of an electronic device or system e.g. a computer system to be powered down or put in a sleep mode that requires less power than while in active operation thereby reducing the total amount of energy consumed by a device over some period of time. The power management techniques may be implemented by power gating and or clock gating various hardware elements of the managed power system thereby conserving battery power.

More particularly the managed power system may include various electrical or electronic elements of the nodes that can operate in various power states drawing multiple levels of power from the power source as controlled by the power management controller of the power management module . The various power states may be defined by any number of power management schemes. In some cases for example the power states may be defined in accordance with the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface ACPI series of specifications including their progeny revisions and variants. In one embodiment for example the power states may be defined by the ACPI Revision 3.0a Dec. 30 2005 the ACPI Revision 3.0a Specification . The ACPI series of specifications define multiple power states for electronic devices such as global system states Gx states device power states Dx states sleeping states Sx states processor power states Cx states device and processor performance states Px states and so forth. It may be appreciated that other power states of varying power levels may be implemented as desired for a given set of design parameters and performance constraints. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

In some embodiments the various electrical or electronic elements of the nodes suitable for power management operations may be generally grouped or organized into the communications sub system and the computing sub system . It may be appreciated however that the sub systems are provided by way of example for purposes of clarity and not limitation and the managed power system may include other electrical or electronic elements of the nodes suitable for power management operations by the power management module . For example the nodes may typically include a computer monitor or display such as a digital electronic display or an analog electronic display. Examples of digital electronic displays may include electronic paper nixie tube displays vacuum fluorescent displays light emitting diode displays electroluminescent displays plasma display panels liquid crystal displays thin film transistor displays organic light emitting diode displays surface conduction electron emitter displays laser television displays carbon nanotubes nanocrystal displays and so forth. An example for analog electronic displays may include cathode ray tube displays. Computer monitors are often placed in a sleep mode when an operating system detects that the computer system has not received any input from a user for a defined period of time. Other system components may include digital cameras touch screens video recorders audio recorders storage devices vibrating elements oscillators system clocks controllers and other platform or system architecture equipment. These other system components can also be placed in a sleep or powered down state in order to conserve energy when the components are not in use. The computer system monitors input devices and wakes devices as needed. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

In various embodiments the managed power system may include the communications sub system . The communications sub system may comprise various communications elements arranged to communicate information and perform communications operations between the nodes . Examples of suitable communications elements may include any electrical or electronic element designed to communicate information over the communications links including without limitation radios transmitters receivers transceivers chipsets amplifiers filters control logic interfaces network interfaces network interface cards NICs antennas antenna arrays digital signal processors baseband processors media access controllers memory units and so forth.

Examples of suitable computing elements may include any electrical or electronic element designed to process information including without limitation processors microprocessors chipsets controllers microcontrollers embedded controllers clocks oscillators audio cards video cards multimedia cards peripherals memory units memory controllers video controllers audio controllers multimedia controllers and so forth.

In various embodiments the power management module may comprise a power source . The power source may be arranged to provide power to the elements of a node in general and the managed power system in particular. In one embodiment for example the power source may be operative to provide varying levels of power to the communications sub system and the computing sub system . In various embodiments the power source may be implemented by a rechargeable battery such as a removable and rechargeable lithium ion battery to provide direct current DC power and or an alternating current AC adapter to draw power from a standard AC main power supply.

In various embodiments the power management module may include a power management controller . The power management controller may generally control power consumption by the managed power system . In one embodiment the power management controller may be operative to control varying levels of power provided to the communications sub system and the computing sub system in accordance with certain defined power states. For example the power management controller may modify switch or transition the power levels provided by the power source to the sub systems to a higher or lower power level thereby effectively modifying a power state for the sub systems .

In various embodiments the power management module may include one or more power control timers . The power control timer may be used by the power management controller to maintain a certain power state for a given power state duration period. The power state duration period may represent a defined time interval a node or portion of a node is in a given power state. For example the power management controller may switch the computing sub system from a higher power state to a lower power state for a defined time interval and when the time interval has expired switch the computing sub system back to the higher power state.

In order to coordinate power management operations for a node the communications sub system the computing sub system and the power management module may communicate various power management messages via a communications bus and the respective power management interfaces and . To manage power for all the devices in a system an operating system typically utilizes standard techniques for communicating control information over a particular Input Output I O interconnect. Examples of various I O interconnects suitable for implementation as the communications bus and associated interfaces may include without limitation Peripheral Component Interconnect PCI PCI Express PCIe CardBus Universal Serial Bus USB IEEE 1394 FireWire and so forth.

Referring again to the communications sub system may include a network state module . The network state module may be arranged to monitor certain states or characteristics of the communications sub system such as the traffic activity of the communications connections capabilities information and other operations for the various communications elements of the communications sub system . The network state module may send communications power management messages to the power management module with the measured characteristics. The power management module may generate power state information for the managed power system based in part on the communications power management messages 

Similarly the computing sub system may include a computing state module . The computing state module may be arranged to monitor certain states or characteristics of the computing sub system such as the level of system activity capabilities information and other operations for the various computing elements of the computing sub system . The computing state module may send computing power management messages to the power management module with the measured characteristics. The power management module may generate power state information for the managed power system based in part on the computing power management messages 

In general operation the power management module may perform power management operations for portions of the managed power system of the node based on power state information received from other portions of the first node . In some cases for example the power mamagement module for the node may be operation to receive communications power state information from the network state module of the communications sub system for the managed power system over the communications bus . The power management module may manage various power states for the computing sub system of the managed power system for the node based on the communications power state information for the communications sub system . The power management module and the sub systems may communicate the communications power state information over the communications bus in accordance with various communications bus protocols.

The communications power state information may represent information explicitly or implicitly related to power states for the communications sub system . The communications power state information may also represent various characteristics or attributes for the power states of the communications sub system such as power state duration periods idle durations resume latencies and so forth. In one embodiment for example the communications power state information may include without limitation a communications power state parameter a communications idle duration parameter a communications resume latency parameter or a power state duration period.

As previously described the power management module may control various power states for the managed power system in accordance with one or more power management standards such as the ACPI standard. The ACPI standard may be suitable for defining the various power states for a portion of the managed power system such as the communications sub system and or the computing sub system . For example the power management module may control power consumption for a processor and chipset of the computing sub system using different processor power consumption states e.g. C Cl C and C as defined by the ACPI Revision 3.0Specification. The power management module send power control commands to the computing sub system over the communications bus and interfaces .

In one embodiment for example the power management module may control power consumption for the computing sub system using an abbreviated set of power states from the ACPI Revision 3.0a Specification referred to as system power states. The system power states define various power states specifically designed for the computing elements processing information for the nodes . Examples for the various system power states may be shown in Table 1 as follows 

Some of the system power states have associated parameters. For example the Si power state has a pair of parameters referred to as a computing idle duration parameter and a computing resume latency parameter. The computing idle duration parameter represents an amount of time or defined time interval the computing sub system will remain in a given power state e.g. Si . The computing resume latency parameter represents an amount of time or defined time interval the computing sub system needs to exit a given power state e.g. Si and enter a higher power state e.g. S . The computing idle duration parameter and the computing resume latency parameter for the system power states may be communicated by the power management messages over the communications bus .

In various embodiments the computing state module may be arranged to generate the computing idle duration parameter and the computing resume latency parameter based on the capabilities of the computing sub system . For example the computing sub system may include various processors operating at different speeds such as a host application or system processor. In another example the computing sub system may include various memory units operating at different read write speeds. In still another example computing sub system may include various I O devices such as a keyboard mouse display memory controllers video controllers audio controllers storage devices e.g. hard drives expansion cards co processors and so forth. The computing state module may evaluate these and other computing capabilities of the computing sub system and generate the appropriate computing idle duration parameter and the computing resume latency parameter based on the evaluated capabilities of the computing sub system .

Although in some embodiments the power states for the communications sub system and the computing sub system may be similarly defined and in synchronization in some embodiments the communications power state information may also be differently defined and not synchronized for the sub systems . For example the power management module may control power consumption for a radio or network interface of the communications sub system using different power states than defined for the computing sub system . In one embodiment for example the power management module may control power consumption for the communications sub system using a set of power states referred to as network link power management NLPM power states. The NLPM power states define various network link power states specifically designed for the communications elements of the communications sub system communicating information over the given communications links . Examples for the various NLPM power states may be shown in Table 2 as follows 

As shown in Table 2 the NLPM power states range from NL to NL where the NL power state represents the highest power state with the maximum power draw the NL and NL power states represent incrementally lower power states relative to the NL power state with correspondingly lower power draws and the NL power state represents the lowest power state with the minimum power draw or none .

As with the system power states some of the NLPM power states have associated parameters. For example the NL Idle and NL Sleep power states each have an associated communications idle duration parameter and a communications resume latency parameter. The communications idle duration parameter represents an amount of time or defined time interval the network link or communications sub system will remain in a given power state e.g. NL NL . The communications idle duration parameter allows the sub systems to enter and exit the lower power states with a deterministic manner. The communications resume latency parameter represents an amount of time or defined time interval the network link or communications sub system needs to exit a given power state e.g. NL NL and enter a higher power state e.g. NL . The communications resume latency parameter allows the sub systems to determine how soon it can expect the communications sub system to wake up and be ready for providing services such as out going transmission. The communications idle duration parameter and the communications resume latency parameter for the NLPM power states may be communicated by the power management messages over the communications bus .

In various embodiments the network state module may be arranged to generate the communications idle duration parameter and the communications resume latency parameter based on the capabilities of the communications sub system . For example the communications sub system may implement various buffers to store information received from the communications connections l such as network packets and forward the information for servicing and processing by the computing sub system . In another example the communications sub system may also implement various buffers to store information received from the communications bus such as network packets and forward the information for communications by the communications sub system to other nodes over the communications connections via the communications links . In yet another example the communications sub system may include various wired or wireless transceiver operating at different communications speeds such as the IEEE 802.3 2005 standard 10 Gigabit Ethernet 10GbE or 10GigE the IEEE 802.3ba proposed standard 100 Gigabit Ethernet 100GbE or 100GigE and so forth. In still another example the communications sub system may include various processors operating at different speeds such as baseband or communications processor. In still another example the network state module may monitor the rate of information being received over the communications connections via the communications links . In this example the network state module of the communications sub system may monitor the communications links to measure packet inter arrival times. Other examples of communications capabilities may include other network traffic load measurements on the communications links e.g. synchronous traffic asynchronous traffic burst traffic and so forth a signal to noise ratio SNR a received signal strength indicator RSSI throughput of the communications bus physical layer PHY speed power state information for other nodes received via one or more PMPDU and so forth. The network state module may evaluate these and other network or communications capabilities of the communications sub system and generate the appropriate communications idle duration parameter and the communications resume latency parameter based on the evaluated capabilities of the communications sub system .

In various embodiments the nodes may use the system power states and or the NLPM power states to enhance power management operations for a given node to improve energy conservation e.g. increase battery life or decrease battery size heat dissipation or overall system performance. In one embodiment for example the network state module of the communications sub system may monitor the communications links and various communications elements e.g. radio baseband processor chipset memory units etc. to determine communications power state information for the communications sub system . The network state module may send a power management message with the communications power state information over the communications bus and interfaces to the power management module . The power management module may receive the power management message and retrieve the communications power state information from the power management message . The power management module may manage power states for the computing sub system based on the communications power state information for the communications sub system . For example the power management module may modify a power level for a computing sub system of the managed power system from a first power level S to a second power level Si using the communications power state information for the communications sub system . Furthermore the power management module may modify the power level for the computing sub system from a first power level S to a second power level Si for a defined time interval referred to as a power state duration period as determined using the communications power state information for the communications sub system .

More particularly the network state module may determine a communications idle duration parameter and a communications resume latency parameter for the communications sub system . By way of example assume the network state module sends a power management message over the communications bus via the interface to the power management module with communications power state information for the communications sub system as follows Communications Idle Duration Parameter 100 milliseconds ms Communications Resume Latency Parameter 1 ms

The power management controller of the power management module may receive the power management message from the communications bus via the interface and retrieve the received parameters e.g. 100 ms 1 ms from the communications power state information. Since the communications sub system does not expect to receive any packets from the communications link or for at least 100 ms the power management controller may send one or more power management messages to the computing sub system to modify a power level for the computing sub system from a first power level S On to a second power level Si Idle for a power state duration period of approximately 100 ms or less as determined using the communications power state information received from the network state module . The power state duration period of 100 ms may be measured or timed by the power control timer .

It may be appreciated that the power management controller may also include other factors other than the received communications idle duration parameter when determining a power state duration period appropriate for the computing sub system . For example the power management controller may determine a power state duration period using the communications resume latency parameter of 1 ms for the communications sub system . In this case the power control timer for the computing sub system may be set for a power state duration period of 100 ms 1 ms 99 ms. In another example the power management controller may set the power control timer for the computing sub system with a power state duration period that accounts for a computing resume latency parameter for the computing sub system . Assume this parameter represents 2 ms the power control timer for the communications sub system may be set for a power state duration period of 100 ms 1 ms resume latency for sub system 2 ms resume latency for sub system 97 ms.

The power management controller may also determine an appropriate power state duration period for the computing sub system using various measured characteristics of the communications links . The network state module may be arranged to monitor the communications links to measure certain channel link or traffic characteristics such as one way or two way latency associated with communicating packets over the communications connection . For example the network state module of the communications sub system may monitor the communications links to measure packet inter arrival times and update the power management controller with a mean or median packet inter arrival time. The power management controller may increase or decrease the power state duration period to account for network link latencies using the measured packet inter arrival time. Other modifiers for the power state duration period may include other network traffic load measurements on the communications links e.g. synchronous traffic asynchronous traffic burst traffic and so forth a signal to noise ratio SNR a received signal strength indicator RSSI throughput of the communications bus physical layer PHY speed power state duration periods for other portions of the node and so forth.

In addition to modifying a power state for the computing sub system based on the power state information from the second node the power management controller may also modify a power state for the communications sub system . Since the communications sub system will not expect to receive any packets from the communications connections for at least 100 ms the power management controller may also send one or more power management messages to the communications sub system to modify a power level for the communications sub system from a first power level NL On to a second power level NL Idle for a power state duration period of approximately 90 ms so it can save system power yet be able to wake up soon enough to service any incoming traffic or events received from the communications connections or the computing sub system .

In one embodiment the power management module may receive communications power state information from the communications sub system and computing power state information from the computing sub system and negotiate a power state for both sub systems using the received power state information. For example prior to modifying power states for the sub systems the sub systems may send capabilities information estimated traffic loads power management schedules and other power management related information to the power management controller . The power management controller may use the capabilities information and estimated traffic loads to negotiate an appropriate NLPM power state system power state power state duration period and associated parameters e.g. idle duration resume latency suitable for a power management policy for the entire node . In this manner the sub systems may synchronize power management operations based on traffic load and power states to enhance energy conservation across all the components of the node .

The logic flow may illustrate various operations for the nodes in general and the managed power system and the power management module in particular. As shown in the logic flow may receive a power management message with communications power state information over a communications bus by a power management module from a communications sub system of a managed power system at block . The logic flow may determine a computing power state and a computing power state duration period for a computing sub system of the managed power system based on the communications power state information at block . The logic flow may switch the computing sub system to the computing power state for the computing power state duration period at block . The embodiments are not limited in this context.

In one embodiment the logic flow may receive a power management message with communications power state information over a communications bus by a power management module from a communications sub system of a managed power system at block . For example the network state module of the node may send communications power state information to the power management module over the communications bus and interface . The communications power state information may include a communications idle duration parameter and a communications resume latency parameter for the communications sub system of the managed power system . The power management module may receive the power management message with the communications power state information from the communications bus via the interface .

In one embodiment the logic flow may determine a computing power state and a computing power state duration period for a computing sub system of the managed power system based on the communications power state information at block . The computing power state may represent a given power state for the computing sub system . The computing power state duration period may represent a time period or time interval when the computing sub system should be in a given power state. For example the power management controller of the node may determine the computing power state and computing power state duration period by evaluating among other factors the received communications idle duration parameter and the communications resume latency parameter for the communications sub system .

In one embodiment the logic flow may switch the computing sub system to the computing power state for the computing power state duration period at block . For example the power management module may switch the computing sub system between various power states for various durations based on the computing power state and computing power state duration period determined at block . For example the power management module may switch the computing sub system for the managed power system from an active power state S to an idle power state Si for the power state duration period e.g. 90 ms .

In addition to controlling the power states for the computing sub system based on the communications power state information the power management module may also control power states for the communications sub system based on the communications power state information. In some cases the power management module may control power states for the communications sub system using the same or similar parameters for the computing sub system . For example the power management module may instruct the communications sub system to switch to a communications power state equivalent to the computing power state for the computing power state duration period using one or more power management messages . In other cases the power management module may control power states for the communications sub system using different parameters then those used for the computing sub system . For example the power management module may determine a separate and different communications power state and a communications power state duration period for the communications sub system based on the communications power state information generated by the network state module . The power management module may instruct the communications sub system to switch to the communications power state for the communications power state duration period using one or more power management messages .
