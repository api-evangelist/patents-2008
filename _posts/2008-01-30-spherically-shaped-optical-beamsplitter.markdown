This application is related to inventor s application titled Cylindrically Shaped Optical Beamsplitter filed on even date.

The invention relates to optical systems and elements. More specifically the invention relates to an optical beamsplitter that can be used to propagate optical signals.

A beamsplitter is an optical device that receives an incident light beam and divides it into two components. The first component is propagated from the beamsplitter as a transmitted beam. The second component is propagated as a reflected beam angularly displaced with respect to the transmitted beam.

A conventional beamsplitter comprises a cube of optically transparent material that encases a thin layer of semi reflecting material oriented diagonally across its interior. Approximately one half of the light entering one face of the beamsplitter is reflected by the semi reflecting material through an adjacent face as a reflected light beam. The remaining portion of the light from the incident light is transmitted by the layer of semi reflecting material through the opposite face as a transmitted light beam.

Beamsplitters are used in optical devices such as in scanners interferometers and back scattering detectors for measuring back scatter from a particle system. One problem associated with conventional cubic beamsplitters is distortion caused by light striking beamsplitter faces at oblique i.e. non perpendicular angles. The transmission through the beamsplitter is refracted according to Fresnel s Equations. The resulting light beam is parallel to the incident beam but displaced from it. The amount of displacement depends on the angle of incidence and the index of refraction of the optical materials used in the beamsplitter. This distortion can be compensated for to some extent by repositioning system components.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 414 797 to Gorden Videen discloses a Beamsplitter Prism with Spherical Faces for Transmitting or Reflecting Spherical Waves Without Magnification.

A spherically shaped optical beamsplitter system and method are provided. An optical beamsplitter comprises an optically transparent material and a partially reflective layer. The optically transparent material has a unitary spherically shaped exterior surface. The exterior surface is the boundary defining an interior. The partially reflective layer is positioned in the interior. Means is provided for rotating the spherically shaped optical beamsplitter.

An embodiment of an optical system comprises an optical beamsplitter incorporating an optically transparent material and a partially reflective layer. The optically transparent material has a unitary spherically shaped exterior surface. The exterior surface defines an interior. The partially reflective layer is positioned at least partially within the interior. The beamsplitter receives incident light and divides the incident light into a first component and a second component. The first component is transmitted from the beamsplitter. The second component is reflected by the partially reflective layer at an angle relative to the first component and transmitted from the optical beamsplitter.

Other devices systems methods features and or advantages will be apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following drawings and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional devices systems methods features and or advantages be included within this description.

As will be described in detail here spherically shaped optical beamsplitters systems and methods are provided. The exterior surface of the beamsplitter that directs light is unitary and essentially spherically shaped. As a result various advantages may be achieved. For example light incident upon such a beamsplitter can be received at an angle that is normal to the exterior surface of the beamsplitter. Light that is propagated from the beamsplitter can be transmitted at an angle that is normal with respect to the exterior surface. Therefore at least some of the light received and transmitted can be propagated without distortion.

Referring now to the drawing is a schematic diagram showing a spherically shaped optical beamsplitter. Beamsplitter is made of a material that is optically transparent with respect to at least one wavelength of light. For example glass quartz plastic and epoxy are optically transparent to visible light. Quartz is transparent to ultraviolet light. Silicon and germanium are transparent to infrared light. The optically transparent material may be optically transparent with respect to more than one wavelength of light.

The exterior surface of the material is defined by a substantially constant radius r extending from center C. One or more portions of the non transmitting exterior surface can be other than spherically shaped. For instance opposing poles of the exterior surface could be flattened to facilitate engagement with a mechanism for rotating the beamsplitter.

Beamsplitter also includes a partially reflective layer which is oriented generally within a plane that intersects center C. Two orthogonal axes longitudinal axis L and transverse axis T extend outwardly from center C. In the L T plane in which the layer is oriented is parallel to the X Y plane.

The partially reflective layer is formed of one or more of various materials known in the art. In the partially reflective layer is continuous and extends across the optically transparent material. The partially reflective layer extends across the optically transparent material so that its outer periphery is adjacent to the exterior surface . Another embodiment the partially reflective layer is discontinuous. The partially reflective layer may not extend to or in the alternative may extend beyond the exterior surface of the beamsplitter.

In transmitted ray is incident upon an object not shown that provides a back scattered ray to the beamsplitter. Both the transmitted ray and back scattered ray are shown in parallel to and laterally offset from each other for ease of illustration only. In reality these two rays are co extensive.

Back scattered ray is received by the beamsplitter and is incident upon an opposing face of the partially reflective layer . A component of the back scattered ray is then reflected as a second reflected ray that is propagated from the beamsplitter. Although not shown in the partially reflective layer may transmit another component of the back scattered ray . The ray shown in is normal to the corresponding portion of the exterior surface of the beamsplitter to which it is incident.

Reference is made to which shows an optical system including a spherically shaped beamsplitter. Optical system includes a beamsplitter incorporating a partially reflective layer . Light source provides light to optional input optics which focuses light passed to the beamsplitter. The input optics can include a lens.

A component of the incident ray is transmitted through the beamsplitter as transmitted ray . The component of the incident ray that is reflected by the partially reflective layer is not shown. Transmitted ray is directed toward a sample that scatters incident light. A component of the scattered light comes back to the beamsplitter as back scattered ray . Back scattered ray is then reflected by the partially reflective layer . Back scattered reflected ray passes to optional output optics which can include one or more lenses for focusing reflected back scattered ray . The back scattered reflected ray provided to detector that analyzes the light. For instance the detector can be an electronic detector such as a photomultiplier tube PMT a photodiode PDA or a charge coupled device CCD or a non electronic detector such as photosensitive film or a human eye. The component of the back scattered ray that is not reflected by partially reflective layer is not shown in .

Optical system also includes a controller and a rotation mechanism used to rotate beamsplitter with respect to at least one axis of rotation. The rotation mechanism has a surface that contacts the exterior surface of the beamsplitter so that movement of the rotation mechanism rotates the beamsplitter. As shown in controller provides an input signal to rotation mechanism so that it rotates as indicated by arrow A. In response beamsplitter rotates as indicated by arrow B. Rotation mechanism can be configured to rotate the beamsplitter with respect to more than one axis. In another embodiment the beamsplitter can be rotated with the light source.

Another embodiment of the optical system is similar to the arrangement shown in . The position of light source and input optics is exchanged with the position of detector and output optics . As beamsplitter is rotated the incident light from the source scans object . The backscattered light from object is transmitted through the beamsplitter to the output optics and detector.

The optical system of is described with reference to the flowchart of . The method or functionality begins at block where a spherically shaped optical beamsplitter is provided. In block the beamsplitter is rotated with respect to at least one axis of rotation to a first orientation. Then in block the beamsplitter is used to acquire information corresponding to the first orientation. When the beamsplitter is used in conjunction with an array of photodiodes the information can correspond to the intensity of the reflected back scattered light incident upon the photodiodes during an exposure period.
