The CBreceptor is one of the most abundant neuromodulatory receptors in the brain and is expressed at high levels in the hippocampus cortex cerebellum and basal ganglia e.g. Wilson et al. 2002 vol. 296 678 682 . Selective CBreceptor antagonists for example pyrazole derivatives such as rimonabant e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 432 984 can be used to treat various conditions such as obesity and metabolic syndrome e.g. Bensaid et al. 2003 vol. 63 no. 4 pp. 908 914 Trillou et al. 2002 vol. 284 R345 R353 Kirkham 2002 vol. 284 R343 R344 neuroinflammatory disorders e.g. Adam et al. 2002 vol. 12 no. 10 1475 1489 U.S. Pat. No. 6 642 258 cognitive disorders and psychosis e.g. Adam et al. 2002 vol. 12 pp. 1475 1489 addiction e.g. smoking cessation U.S. Patent Publ. 2003 0087933 gastrointestinal disorders e.g. Lange et al. 2004 vol. 47 627 643 and cardiovascular conditions e.g. Porter et al. 2001 vol. 90 45 60 Sanofi Aventis Publication Bear Stearns Conference New York Sep. 14 2004 pages 19 24 .

There now exists extensive pre clinical and clinical data supporting the use of CB1 receptor antagonists inverse agonists for the treatment of obesity.

Preparations of marijuana have been used for over 5000 years for both medicinal and recreational purposes. The major psychoactive ingredient of marijuana has been identified as delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol delta 9 THC one of a member of over 60 related cannabinoid compounds isolated from this plant. It has been demonstrated that delta 9 THC exerts its effects via agonist interaction with cannabinoid CB receptors. So far two cannabinoid receptor subtypes have been characterised CBand CB . The CBreceptor subtype is found predominantly in the central nervous system and to a lesser extent in the peripheral nervous system and various peripheral organs. The CBreceptor subtype is found predominantly in lymphoid tissues and cells. To date three endogenous agonists endocannabinoids have been identified which interact with both CBand CBreceptors anandamide 2 arachidonyl glycerol and noladin ether .

Genetically obese rats and mice exhibit markedly elevated endocannabinoid levels in brain regions associated with ingestive behaviour Di Marzo et al. 2001 Nature 410 822 825 . Furthermore increased levels of endocannabinoids are observed upon the fasting of normal lean animals Kirkham et al. British Journal of Pharmacology 2002 136 4 550 557 .

Exogenous application of endocannabinoids leads to the same physiological effects observed with delta 9 THC treatment including appetite stimulation Jamshida et al. British Journal of Pharmacology 2001 134 1151 1 154 analgesia hypolocomotion hypothermia and catalepsy.

CB CB and CB CB receptor knockout mice have been used to elucidate the specific role of the two cannabinoid receptor subtypes. Furthermore for ligands such as delta 9 THC which act as agonists at both receptors these mice have allowed identification of which receptor subtype is mediating specific physiological effects. CB but not CB mice are resistant to the behavioural effects of agonists such as delta 9 THC. CB animals have also been shown to be resistant to both the body weight gain associated with chronic high fat diet exposure and the appetite stimulating effects of acute food deprivation.

These findings suggest a clear role for both endogenous and exogenous cannabinoid receptor agonists in increasing food intake and body weight via selective activation of the CBreceptor subtype.

The therapeutic potential for cannabinoid receptor ligands has been extensively reviewed Exp. Opin. Ther. Pat. 1998 8 3010 313 Exp. Opin. Ther. Pat. 2000 10 1529 1538 Trends in Pharm. Sci. 2000 2 1 218 224 Exp. Opin. Ther. Pat. 2002 12 10 1475 1489 .

At least one compound SR 14171 6A Rimonabant characterised as a CBreceptor antagonist inverse agonist is known to be in clinical trials for the treatment of obesity.

Clinical trials with the CBreceptor antagonist rimonabant have also observed an antidiabetic action that exceeds that accounted for by weight loss alone Scheen A. J. et al. Lancet 2006 in press . CBreceptor mRNA is located on and cells in the Islets of Langerhans and it has been reported that CBreceptor agonists reduce insulin release from pancreatic beta cells in vitro in response to a glucose load Juan Pico et al Cell Calcium 39 2006 155 162 . Consistent with this Bermudez Siva et al. Eur J Pharmacol. 531 2006 282 284 have reported that CBreceptor agonists increase glucose intolerance following ip injection of a glucose load to rats. This effect was reversed by a CBreceptor antagonist that increased glucose tolerance in the test when given alone. Thus the action of rimonabant may be due to a direct action on the pancreas. It is also possible that CBreceptor antagonists affect insulin sensitivity indirectly via an action on adiponectin Chandran et al. Diabetes care 26 2003 2442 2450 which is elevated by CBreceptor antagonists Cota et al. J Clin Invest. 112 2003 423 431 Bensaid et al. Mol Pharmacol. 63 2003 908 914 . Indeed it has been reported that endocannabinoid levels are enhanced in the pancreas and adipose tissue of obese and diabetic mice and in the plasma and adipose tissue of obese or type 2 diabetic patients Matias et al. J Clin Endocrinol and Metab. 9 1 2006 3171 3180 suggesting a possible causal role of elevated cannabinoid tone in the onset of type 2 diabetes.

Further substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium i.e. H may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability e.g. increased in vivo half life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labelled compounds of Formula I can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes and or in the Examples hereinbelow by substituting an appropriate isotopically labelled reagent for a non isotopically labelled reagent.

Polymorphic forms of the compounds of Formula I and of the salts solvates and prodrugs of the compounds of Formula I are intended to be included in the present invention.

The functional efficacy of compounds to activate second messengers within the cell was determined utilizing the GTP S binding assay. Guanine nucleotides are phosphorylated within the plasma membrane of the cell following binding and activation by agonists. A radiolabelled derivative of guanine triphosphate GTP is utilized in this assay as it cannot be dephosphorylated and therefore accumulates following agonist binding. The simultaneous presence of an antagonist into this system will shift the agonist concentration curve to the right with increasing concentrations of antagonist producing a greater rightward shift in the dose response curve of the agonist.

Commercially purchased membranes were incubated with 10 mM GDP to allow sufficient substrate for phosphorylation in the presence of agonist.
