Nitrogen monoxide can exist in three forms NO nitroxyl NO. nitric oxide and NO nitrosonium . NO. is a highly reactive short lived species that is potentially toxic to cells. This is critical because the pharmacological efficacy of NO depends upon the form in which it is delivered. In contrast to the nitric oxide radical NO. nitrosonium NO does not react with Oor O species and functionalities capable of transferring and or releasing NO and NO are also resistant to decomposition in the presence of many redox metals. Consequently administration of charged NO equivalents positive and or negative does not result in the generation of toxic by products or the elimination of the active NO group.

The term nitric oxide encompasses uncharged nitric oxide NO. and charged nitrogen monoxide species preferably charged nitrogen monoxide species such as nitrosonium ion NO and nitroxyl ion NO . The reactive form of nitric oxide can be provided by gaseous nitric oxide.

In the case of capsules tablets effervescent tablets and pills the dosage forms can also comprise buffering agents. Soft gelatin capsules can be prepared to contain a mixture of the active compounds or compositions of the invention and vegetable oil. Hard gelatin capsules can contain granules of the active compound in combination with a solid pulverulent carrier such as lactose saccharose sorbitol mannitol potato starch corn starch amylopectin cellulose derivatives of gelatin. Tablets and pills can be prepared with enteric coatings.

Liquid dosage forms for oral administration can include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions solutions suspensions syrups and elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the art such as water. Such compositions can also comprise adjuvants such as wetting agents emulsifying and suspending agents and sweetening flavoring and perfuming agents.

Suppositories for vaginal or rectal administration of the compounds and compositions of the invention can be prepared by mixing the compounds or compositions with a suitable nonirritating excipient such as cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols which are solid at room temperature but liquid at rectal temperature such that they will melt in the rectum and release the drug.

Injectable preparations for example sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions can be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing agents wetting agents and or suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation can also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent for example as a solution in 1 3 butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be used are water Ringer s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. Sterile fixed oils are also conventionally used as a solvent or suspending medium.

The compositions of this invention can further include conventional excipients i.e. pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic carrier substances suitable for parenteral application which do not deleteriously react with the active compounds. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include for example water salt solutions alcohol vegetable oils polyethylene glycols gelatin lactose amylose magnesium stearate talc surfactants silicic acid viscous paraffin perfume oil fatty acid monoglycerides and diglycerides petroethral fatty acid esters hydroxymethyl cellulose polyvinylpyrrolidone and the like. The pharmaceutical preparations can be sterilized and if desired mixed with auxiliary agents e.g. lubricants preservatives stabilizers wetting agents emulsifiers salts for influencing osmotic pressure buffers colorings flavoring and or aromatic substances and the like which do not deleteriously react with the active compounds. For parenteral application particularly suitable vehicles consist of solutions preferably oily or aqueous solutions as well as suspensions emulsions or implants. Aqueous suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension and include for example sodium carboxymethyl cellulose sorbitol and or dextran. Optionally the suspension may also contain stabilizers.

The composition if desired can also contain minor amounts of wetting agents emulsifying agents and or pH buffering agents. The composition can be a liquid solution suspension emulsion tablet pill capsule sustained release formulation or powder.

Sustained release dosage forms of the invention may comprise microparticles and or nanoparticles having a therapeutic agent dispersed therein or may comprise the therapeutic agent in pure preferably crystalline solid form. For sustained release administration microparticle dosage forms comprising pure crystalline therapeutic agents. The therapeutic dosage forms of this aspect of the invention may be of any configuration suitable for sustained release.

Nanoparticle sustained release therapeutic dosage forms are preferably biodegradable and optionally bind to the vascular smooth muscle cells and enter those cells primarily by endocytosis. The biodegradation of the nanoparticles occurs over time e.g. 30 to 120 days or 10 to 21 days in prelysosomic vesicles and lysosomes. Larger microparticle therapeutic dosage forms of the invention release the therapeutic agents for subsequent target cell uptake with only a few of the smaller microparticles entering the cell by phagocytosis. A practitioner in the art will appreciate that the precise mechanism by which a target cell assimilates and metabolizes a dosage form of the invention depends on the morphology physiology and metabolic processes of those cells. The size of the particle sustained release therapeutic dosage forms is also important with respect to the mode of cellular assimilation. For example the smaller nanoparticles can flow with the interstitial fluid between cells and penetrate the infused tissue. The larger microparticles tend to be more easily trapped interstitially in the infused primary tissue and thus are useful to deliver anti proliferative therapeutic agents.

Particular sustained release dosage forms of the invention comprise biodegradable microparticles or nanoparticles. More particularly biodegradable microparticles or nanoparticles are formed of a polymer containing matrix that bio degrades by random nonenzymatic hydrolytic scissioning to release therapeutic agent thereby forming pores within the particulate structure.

In a particular embodiment the compositions of the invention are orally administered as a sustained release tablet or a sustained release capsule. For example the sustained release formulations can comprise an effective amount of at least one nitric oxide enhancing diuretic compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and optionally at least one nitric oxide donor or the sustained release formulations can comprise an effective amount of at least one nitric oxide enhancing diuretic compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and at least one nitric oxide donor and optionally at least one therapeutic agent

Procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of NitroMed Inc. Male Wistar rats 180 200 g were purchased from Charles River Laboratories Kingston N.Y. or Raleigh N.C. and allowed to acclimate in the facility for a period of at least 72 h. Rats were randomly housed 2 3 per cage in a light controlled room with a 12 hour light dark cycle and allowed ad libitum access to food and water.

Prior to the experiment each rat was placed in a metabolic cage and allowed to acclimate for a period of 24 48 hours with food and water ad libitum. During this acclimation period rats received mash food instead of pellet food to prevent contamination of the urine samples. All rats were fasted for 18 hours prior to experimentation. In addition water was removed 90 minutes prior to oral dosing with test compound or vehicle.

The test compounds were prepared immediately prior to dosing in 0.5 Methocel F4M Premium Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose lot PF12012N12 Dow Chemical Company USA and homogenized with a glass Teflon pestle motorized homogenizer. Gently vortexed test compounds were administered intragastrically p.o. 30 mg kg or 3 mg kg at a dose volume of 3 ml per rat using an 18 gauge gavage needle. Urine volume ml was monitored and urine was collected for subsequent electrolyte analysis over a 6 hours period. Table 1 gives the urine volume collected over a period of 6 hours. Data are expressed as mean SEM n 6 or 7.

The effect of chronic administration of Example 51 and hydrochlorothiazide HCT on plasma aldosterone and renin levels was tested in male Wistar rats. Compounds were administered via mini osmotic pumps implanted subcutaneously in the scapular area of the rats using asceptic techniques. Molar equivalent doses of HCT and Example 51 10 mg kg day in 50 DMSO PEG300 were delivered for 28 days via Alzet mini pumps and compared to vehicle treated animals. A 250 l blood sample was obtained from tail vein cannulae for analysis of aldosterone and plasma renin levels Day 0 . Terminal plasma was collected on day 29 for analysis of aldosterone and plasma renin levels. Plasma renin and aldosterone were measured utilizing commercially available kits Cayman Chemical Ann Arbor Mich. and Alpha Diagnostics San Antonio Tex. respectively .

Table 2 shows that the plasma aldosterone and renin measured on day 29 were significantly lowered following Example 51 treatment as compared to vehicle or HCT treated rats indicating that administration of Example 51 appeared to have beneficial effects on the renin angiotensin system by reducing plasma aldosterone and renin levels when compared to hydrochlorothiazide.

Male Wistar rats 250 400 g were anesthetized with ketamine 10 mg kg i.p. exsanguinated and their abdominal aorta were removed. After the removal of fat and connective tissue the aorta was cut into rings 3 4 mm in length and suspended in 10 ml organ baths containing a modified Krebs solution composition mM NaCl 119 CaCl2.5 KCl 4.5 NaHCO25 MgCl1.25 NaHPO1.0 D glucose 11.1 . The Krebs solution was maintained at 37 C. and gassed with 5 COin O. The aortic rings were suspended at an initial resting tension of 1.5 g and washed every 15 minutes during a 60 minute equilibration period. After the equilibration period the rings were contracted with 1 M phenylephrine and the contraction was allowed to reach a plateau before test compounds dissolved in DMSO were administered in a cumulative fashion 1 30 000 nM . Results were calculated as a percentage of the maximum relaxation produced by 10 mM papaverine added at the end of the experiment.

The ability of Example 46b to relax isolated rat aorta precontracted with phenylephrine 1 M was studied. Example 46b was an efficacious relaxant agent in the rat aorta with an ECvalue of 7 M. The vasorelaxant response elicited by Example 46b was abolished in the presence of ODQ a potent and selective inhibitor of nitric oxide NO sensitive guanylyl cyclase.

Male Wistar rats 250 300 g were anesthetized with ketamine 10 mg kg i.p. exsanguinated and their abdominal aorta were removed. After the removal of fat and connective tissue the aorta was cut into rings 3 4 mm in length and suspended in 10 ml organ baths containing a modified Krebs solution composition mM NaCl 119 CaCl2.5 KCl 4.5 NaHCO25 MgCl1.25 NaHPO1.0 D glucose 11.1 . The Krebs solution was maintained at 37 C. and gassed with 5 COin O. The aortic rings were suspended at an initial resting tension of 1.5 g and washed every 15 minutes during a 60 minute equilibration period. After the equilibration period the rings were contracted with 1 M phenylephrine. Once the contraction to the phenylephrine had reached a plateau tissues were washed 3 times over a 15 min. period. Test articles or vehicle DMSO were added to the tissues and 20 min. later each tissue was contracted with angiotensin II 100 nM and the contraction to angiotensin II was allowed to reach its maximum before the experiment was terminated. Results were calculated as a percentage of the maximum contraction produced by 100 nM angiotensin II in tissues which received only the DMSO vehicle.

The ability of HCT Example 17b Example 51 Example 56b and the des NO metabolite of Example 17b Example 26 to inhibit contractions elicited by 100 nM angiotensin II in isolated rat aorta was studied. Neither HCT nor the des NO compound Example 26 significantly inhibited the angiotensin II induced contractions whereas Example 17b Example 51 and Example 56b produced significant inhibition Table 3 . The difference in their activity is likely to be due to the ability of Example 17b Example 51 and Example 56b to release bioavailable NO in the rat aorta.

The effect of subchronic administration of Example 1c and hydrochlorothiazide HCT on blood pressure was assessed in telemeterized male Dahl salt sensitive rats 5 6 weeks old 125 150 g fed a high salt 8 diet for 4 weeks. Compounds were administered twice a day for 7 eight days via gavage at 30 mg kg HCT equivalent in a 0.5 methylcellulose vehicle. Blood pressure was continuously monitored by telemetry and reported as a change in mean arterial blood pressure MABP over a 24 h period.

Salt diet induced hypertension a 10 mm Hg change in mean arterial blood pressure was noted in vehicle treated animals during the treatment period. shows that animals orally treated twice a day with Example 1c but not HCT at 30 mg kg exhibited reductions in blood pressure approximately 5 mm Hg during the treatment period.
