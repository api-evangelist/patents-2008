The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of plant botanically known as and hereinafter referred to by the name Kolmarest .

The new plant is a product of a planned breeding program conducted by the Inventor in Heelsum The Netherlands. The objective of the breeding program is to create new pot type cultivars with strong foliage and numerous attractive fruits.

The new plant originated from a cross pollination in 2000 in Heelsum The Netherlands of Pinky Flair not patented as the female or seed parent with a proprietary selection of identified as code number H 27 not patented as the male or pollen parent. The new was discovered and selected by the Inventor as a single flowering plant within the progeny of the stated cross pollination in a controlled greenhouse environment in Heelsum The Netherlands in 2003.

Asexual reproduction of the new plant by vegetative cuttings in Boskoop The Netherlands since 2004 has shown that the unique features of this new plant are stable and reproduced true to type in successive generations.

Plants of the new have not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environment such as temperature and light intensity without however any variance in genotype.

The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of Kolmarest . These characteristics in combination distinguish Kolmarest as a new and distinct cultivar of

Plants of the new differ primarily from plants of the female parent Pinky Flair in the following characteristics 

Plants of the new can be compared to plants of the Kolmred disclosed in U.S. Plant Pat. No. 13 554. In side by side comparisons conducted in Boskoop The Netherlands plants of the new differed primarily from plants of Kolmred in the following characteristics 

Plants used for the aforementioned photographs and following description were grown for two years under conditions which closely approximate commercial production conditions in containers in an outdoor nursery in Boskoop The Netherlands. During the production of the plants day temperatures ranged from 12 C. to 30 C. and night temperatures ranged from 4 C. to averaged 14 C. In the following description color references are made to The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart 2001 Edition except where general terms of ordinary dictionary significance are used.
