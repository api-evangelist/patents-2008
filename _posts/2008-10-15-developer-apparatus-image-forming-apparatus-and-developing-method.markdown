The disclosure of Japanese Patent Applications No. 2007 278968 filed on Oct. 26 2007 and No. 2008 205119 filed on Aug. 8 2008 including specification drawings and claims is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates to a developer apparatus which comprises a toner carrier roller which carries toner on a surface thereof an image forming apparatus and a developing method of developing an electrostatic latent image with toner using this roller.

Techniques for developing an electrostatic latent image with toner include an apparatus which causes a surface of a toner carrier roller to carry toner the toner carrier roller being shaped approximately like a cylinder. For the purpose of improving the characteristics of toner carried on the surface of such a toner carrier roller the applicant of the present application has earlier disclosed a structure of a toner carrier roller having a cylindrical shape that the surface of the roller includes convex sections which are regularly arranged and a concave section which surrounds the convex sections JP A 2007 127800 . Since the concavo convex patterns in the surface are regulated and uniform such a structure is advantageous in that it permits easy control of the thickness of a toner layer which is carried on the surface of the roller the charge level and the like.

However in the case where a toner carrier roller having the structure above is used owing to the evenness of the convexoconcave scattering of toner from the surface of the toner carrier roller fog and the like will be a problem unless a toner layer thickness on the toner carrier roller is strictly controlled. According to research by the inventors of the invention one of the primary causes of these phenomena appears to be that when old toner whose characteristics have degraded in accordance with use is present together with new toner having excellent characteristics the old toner tends to be carried particularly in a far layer from the surface of the toner carrier roller. In a toner layer far from the surface of the toner carrier roller adhesion of toner to the toner carrier roller is weak. Hence it is considered that leakage and scattering of toner and fog are easy to occur.

An advantage of some aspects of the invention is to provide technology for reducing leakage and scattering of toner from a toner carrier roller fog and the like in a developer apparatus an image forming apparatus and a developing method which use a toner carrier roller whose surface is provided with convexoconcave.

According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a developer apparatus comprising a container which houses toner a toner carrier roller that is provided on a surface thereof with a plurality of convex sections which are regularly arranged and a concave section which surrounds the convex sections is shaped approximately like a cylinder and rotates while carrying a toner layer of charged toner supplied from the container on the surface thereof and a restriction member that abuts on the surface of the toner carrier roller to form a restriction nip restricts a thickness of the toner layer carried on the surface of the toner carrier roller in the restriction nip and removes the toner layer on the convex sections from among the toner layer carried on the surface of the toner carrier roller at an upstream side end of the restriction nip in a rotation direction of the toner carrier roller.

According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided an image forming apparatus comprising an image carrier that carries an electrostatic latent image and a developer that includes a toner carrier roller which is provided on a surface thereof with a plurality of convex sections which are regularly arranged and a concave section which surrounds the convex sections is shaped approximately like a cylinder and carries a toner layer of charged toner on the surface thereof the developer developing the electrostatic latent image carried by the image carrier with the toner wherein within the surface of the toner carrier roller after the convex sections and the concave section have carried the toner layer a restriction member abutting on the surface of the toner carrier roller removes the toner layer on the convex sections.

According to a third aspect of the invention there is provided a developing method comprising arranging a toner carrier roller opposed to an image carrier which carries an electrostatic latent image the toner carrier roller being provided on a surface thereof with a plurality of convex sections which are regularly arranged and a concave section which surrounds the convex sections being shaped approximately like a cylinder and carrying a toner layer of charged toner on the surface thereof developing the electrostatic latent image with the toner causing the convex sections and the concave section within the surface of the toner carrier roller to carry the toner layer before the arranging the toner carrier roller carrying the toner layer opposed to the image carrier and removing the toner layer on the convex sections by means of a restriction member abutting on the surface of the toner carrier roller.

The findings of the inventors of the invention based on various experiments although will be described in detail later will now be described briefly. Of toner carried by the surface of a toner carrier roller new toner having excellent characteristics hereinafter referred to as new toner gathers near the surface of the toner carrier roller whereas toner whose characteristics have degraded with long use hereinafter referred to as old toner is contained in concentrated amounts in toner which is on top of the new toner and which is carried as it is separated from the surface of the toner carrier roller. In other words a toner layer made mainly of new toner is formed first on the surface of the toner carrier roller and another toner layer containing a big amount of old toner is formed on the surface of the previous toner layer. Such old toner owing to its reduced contact with the toner carrier roller is not charged sufficiently and hence may leak scatter or cause fog.

Noting this the invention uses a structure that from among toner layers formed on the surface of the toner carrier roller a restriction member removes a toner layer which is on the convex sections of the toner carrier roller. In this structure of toner thus removed from the convex sections new toner having a high charge level pushes away old toner which is carried by the concave section has a low charge level and adheres to the toner carrier roller with weak electrostatic suction force. As this lowers the proportion of the old toner contained in thus restricted toner layers it is possible to suppress toner scattering fog and the like.

When a pressure is applied to old toner having a low charge level toner particles may clump together forming an aggregate having a large diameter and a low charge level and this aggregate may leak out to outside the developer apparatus. However according to the invention since it is only the concave section within the surface of the toner carrier roller that carries toner toner carried by the concave section is free from the pressure applied by the restriction member. This makes it difficult for toner to clump together to form an aggregate and this makes it possible to suppress degradation of toner itself which is effective in discouraging scattering of toner to outside the developer apparatus.

According to a fourth aspect of the invention there is provided a developer apparatus comprising a container which houses toner a toner carrier roller which is shaped approximately like a cylinder is provided on a surface thereof with a plurality of convex sections which are regularly arranged and a concave section which surrounds the convex sections and rotates while carrying a toner layer of charged toner supplied from the container on the surface thereof a height difference between the convex sections and the concave section being equal to or larger than twice a volume average particle diameter of toner and a restriction member which abuts on the surface of the toner carrier roller to remove a toner layer on the convex sections from among the toner layer carried on the surface of the toner carrier roller.

According to a fifth aspect of the invention there is provided an image forming apparatus comprising an image carrier that carries an electrostatic latent image and a developer that includes a toner carrier roller and a restriction member and develops the electrostatic latent image carried by the image carrier with toner the toner carrier roller being provided on a surface thereof with a plurality of convex sections which are regularly arranged and a concave section which surrounds the convex sections being shaped approximately like a cylinder and carrying a toner layer of charged toner on the surface thereof the restriction member abutting on the surface of the toner carrier roller to remove a toner layer on the convex sections from among the toner layer carried on the surface of the toner carrier roller a height difference between the convex sections and the concave section being equal to or larger than twice a volume average particle diameter of toner.

According to the invention having the structure above since the restriction member removes toner which is on the convex sections within the surface of the toner carrier roller it is possible to suppress leakage scattering and the like of toner having an insufficient charge level as in the developer apparatus described above. Meanwhile it is possible for the concave section of the toner carrier roller to carry two or more layers of toner. For this reason there is such toner which is carried by the concave section but is not in direct contact with the surface of the toner carrier roller. Making such toner carried by the toner carrier roller the invention attains a better development efficiency during development of an electrostatic latent image.

The above and further objects and novel features of the invention will more fully appear from the following detailed description when the same is read in connection with the accompanying drawing. It is to be expressly understood however that the drawing is for purpose of illustration only and is not intended as a definition of the limits of the invention.

In the engine part EG a photosensitive member is disposed so that the photosensitive member can freely rotate in an arrow direction D shown in . Around the photosensitive member a charger unit a rotary developer unit and a cleaner are disposed in the rotation direction D. A predetermined charging bias is applied upon the charger unit whereby an outer circumferential surface of the photosensitive member is charged uniformly to a predetermined surface potential. The cleaner removes toner which remains adhering to the surface of the photosensitive member after primary transfer and collects the toner into a waste toner tank which is disposed inside the cleaner . The photosensitive member the charger unit and the cleaner integrated as one form a photosensitive member cartridge . The photosensitive member cartridge can be freely attached to and detached from an apparatus main body as one integrated unit.

An exposure unit emits a light beam L toward the outer circumferential surface of the photosensitive member charged by the charger unit . This exposure unit exposes the photosensitive member by the light beam L in accordance with the image signal given from the external apparatus to form an electrostatic latent image corresponding to the image signal.

The developer unit develops thus formed electrostatic latent image with toner. Specifically the developer unit includes a support frame which is provided rotatable about a rotation shaft orthogonal to a plane of and a yellow developer Y a cyan developer C a magenta developer M and a black developer K which are freely attachable to and detachable from the support frame and house toner of the respective colors. An engine controller controls the developer unit . The developer unit is driven into rotation based on a control instruction from the engine controller . When the developers Y C M and K are selectively positioned at a predetermined developing position which abuts on the photosensitive member or is faced with the photosensitive member over a predetermined gap the developing roller which is disposed in this developer and carries a toner of a selected color is positioned facing the photosensitive member and the developing roller supplies the toner onto the surface of the photosensitive member at the facing position. As a result the electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive member is visualized with the toner of the selected color.

The space inside the housing is divided by a partition wall into a first chamber and a second chamber . The feed roller and the developing roller are both provided in the second chamber . With a rotation of these rollers toner within the second chamber flows and is fed to the surface of the developing roller while getting agitated. Meanwhile toner stored inside the first chamber would not be moved by the rotation since it is isolated from the feed roller and the developing roller . This toner is mixed with toner stored in the second chamber and is agitated by the rotation of the developer unit while holding the developer.

As described above in this developer the inside of the housing is separated into the two chambers and the side walls of the housing and the partition wall surround the feed roller and the developing roller and accordingly the second chamber of relatively small volume is provided. Therefore even when a remaining toner amount is small toner is supplied efficiently to near the developing roller . Further supply of toner from the first chamber to the second chamber and agitation of the whole toner are performed by the rotation of the developer unit . Hence an auger less structure is realized that an agitator member auger for agitating toner is not provided inside the developer.

Further in the developer K a restriction blade is disposed which restricts the thickness of the toner layer formed on the surface of the developing roller into the predetermined thickness. The restriction blade includes a plate like member made of elastic material such as stainless steel phosphor bronze or the like and an elastic member which is attached to a front edge of the plate like member and is made of a resin member such as silicone rubber and a urethane rubber. A rear edge of the plate like member is fixed to the housing . The elastic member attached to the front edge of the plate like member is positioned on the upstream side to the rear edge of the plate like member in a rotation direction D of the developing roller shown by an arrow in . The elastic member elastically abuts on the surface of the developing roller to form a restriction nip thereby restricting the toner layer formed on the surface of the developing roller finally into the predetermined thickness.

The toner layer thus formed on the surface of the developing roller is gradually transported by the rotation of the developing roller to an opposed position facing the photosensitive member on a surface of which the electrostatic latent image has been formed. When a developing bias from a bias power source not shown is applied upon the developing roller the toner carried on the developing roller partially adheres to respective portions within the surface of the photosensitive member in accordance with a surface potential thereof. The electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive member is visualized as a toner image in this toner color in this manner.

The housing further includes a seal member which is pressed against the surface of the developing roller on the downstream side to the opposed position facing the photosensitive member in the rotation direction of the developing roller . The seal member guides toner which remains on the surface of the developing roller after moving past the opposed position facing the photosensitive member to inside the housing and prevents toner inside the housing from leaking to outside.

Each one of the convex sections projects forward from the plane of and a top surface of each convex section forms a part of a single cylindrical surface which is coaxial with a rotation shaft of the developing roller . The concave section is a continuous groove which surrounds the convex sections like a net. The entire concave section also forms a single cylindrical surface which is different from the cylindrical surface which is made by the convex sections and is coaxial with the rotation shaft of the developing roller . The developing roller having such a structure may be made by the manufacturing method described in JP A 2007 140080 for instance. Each convex section may further be processed so that the top surface thereof becomes flat.

The length L of a side of the top surface of each convex section and a distance L between the respective convex sections may be but are not limited to 10 through 100 m approximately for instance. The shape the arrangement and the like of the convex sections are not limited to those described here. A difference in height between the convex sections and the concave section will be described later.

Referring back to the description of the image forming apparatus is continued. The toner image developed by the developer unit as described above is primarily transferred onto an intermediate transfer belt of a transfer unit in a primary transfer region TR. The transfer unit includes the intermediate transfer belt mounted on a plurality of rollers to and a driver not shown for driving the roller into rotation to rotate the intermediate transfer belt in a specified rotating direction D. In the case of transferring a color image onto the sheet S the toner images of the respective colors formed on the photosensitive member are superimposed on the intermediate transfer belt to form the color image which is secondarily transferred onto the sheet S dispensed one by one from a cassette and conveyed to a secondary transfer region TR along a conveyance path F.

At this time for the purpose of correctly transferring the image on the intermediate transfer belt onto the sheet S at a predetermined position the timing of feeding the sheet S into the secondary transfer region TR is controlled. To be more specific there is a gate roller disposed in front of the secondary transfer region TR on the transportation path F. The gate roller starts to rotate in accordance with the timing of rotation of the intermediate transfer belt and accordingly the sheet S is fed into the secondary transfer region TR at a predetermined timing.

Further the sheet S on which the color image is thus formed is transported to a discharge tray which is disposed at a top surface of the apparatus main body via a pre discharge roller and a discharge roller after the toner image is fixed to the sheet S by a fixing unit . Meanwhile when images are to be formed on the both surfaces of the sheet S the discharge roller starts rotating in the reverse direction upon arrival of the rear end of the sheet S which carries the image on its one surface as described above at a reversing position PR located behind the pre discharge roller thereby transporting the sheet S in the arrow direction D along a reverse transportation path FR. The sheet S is returned back to the transportation path F again before arriving at the gate roller . At this time the surface of the sheet S which abuts on the intermediate transfer belt in the secondary transfer region TR and is to receive a transferred image is opposite to the surface which already carries the image. In this fashion it is possible to form images on the both surfaces of the sheet S.

Further as shown in the respective developers Y C M and K comprise memories and respectively which store data related to the production lot the use history the remaining toner amount and the like of the developers. In addition wireless telecommunication devices Y C M and K are provided in the developers Y C M and K respectively. When necessary the telecommunication devices selectively perform non contact data telecommunication with a wireless telecommunication device which is provided in the apparatus main body whereby data transmission between the CPU and the memories through via the interface is performed to manage various types of information regarding the developers such as management of consumables. Meanwhile in this embodiment non contact data transmission using electromagnetic scheme such as wireless telecommunication is performed. However the apparatus main body and each developer may be provided with connectors and the like and the connectors may be engaged mechanically to perform data transmission between each other.

Further as shown in the apparatus includes a display which is controlled by a CPU of the main controller . The display is formed by a liquid crystal display for instance and shows predetermined messages which are indicative of operation guidance for a user a progress in the image forming operation abnormality in the apparatus the timing of exchanging any one of the units and the like in accordance with the control command from the CPU .

In a reference numeral represents an image memory provided in the main controller in order to store the image supplied from the external apparatus such as a host computer via the interface . A reference numeral represents a ROM for storage of an operation program executed by the CPU and control data used for controlling the engine EG. A reference numeral represents a RAM for temporary storage of operation results given by the CPU and other data.

Further there is a cleaner in the vicinity of the roller . The cleaner moves nearer to and away from the roller driven by an electromagnetic clutch not shown. In a condition that the cleaner is moved nearer to the roller a blade of the cleaner abuts on the surface of the intermediate transfer belt mounted on the roller and scrapes off the toner remaining on and adhering to the outer circumferential surface of the intermediate transfer belt after the secondary transfer.

Furthermore a density sensor is disposed in the vicinity of the roller . The density sensor confronts a surface of the intermediate transfer belt and measures as needed the density of the toner image formed on the outer circumferential surface of the intermediate transfer belt . Based on the measurement results the apparatus adjusts the operating conditions of the individual parts thereof that affects the image quality such as a developing bias applied to each developer the intensity of the exposure beam L and tone correction characteristics of the apparatus for example.

The density sensor is structured to output a signal corresponding to a contrasting density of a region of a predetermined area defined on the intermediate transfer belt using a reflective optical sensor for example. The CPU is adapted to detect image densities of individual parts of the toner image on the intermediate transfer belt by periodically sampling the output signals from the density sensor while moving the intermediate transfer belt in rotation.

A detailed description will now be given on restriction of toner layers on the developing roller in the developer K . . . of the image forming apparatus having the structure described above. In the developer K . . . of this image forming apparatus the feed roller abuts on the surface of the developing roller inside the housing which contains toner T as described earlier and the restriction blade abuts on a toner layer which is on the developing roller at the downstream side in the rotation direction of the developing roller and accordingly the thickness of the toner layer which is carried on the surface of the developing roller is regulated. When the thickness is not appropriate the image forming operation will be influenced. Specifically when the toner layer is too thin the amount of toner transported to the opposed position facing the photosensitive member will be a little and a sufficient image density will not be obtained. On the other hand when the toner layer is too thick toner may fall off from the surface of the developing roller and leak inside the apparatus may scatter around from the developing roller as a cloud and may adhere onto the photosensitive member to cause fog. These phenomena will hereinafter be referred to as toner scattering and the like .

First the principle of toner layer restriction in this embodiment will be described. In a condition that a relatively thick toner layer that is the thickness being approximately a several times as large as the volume average particle diameter of toner was formed the inventors of the invention conducted various experiments upon the causal correlation between the condition of the surface of the developing roller on which the toner layer is formed and toner scattering and the like. As a result it has become clear that the model below would explain the mechanism of toner scattering and the like.

Out of these new toner Tn having high fluidity and a high charge level is attracted toward the surface of the developing roller due to electrostatic force Ft. On the other hand old toner is inferior to new toner in terms of fluidity and charging characteristics because of burying separation or the like of an additive and hence the power attracted to the developing roller of old toner is weaker than that of new toner. As a result toner directly contacting the developing roller is mostly new toner Tn as shown in . In short of toner layers formed on the surface of the developing roller the first layer which is the closest to the developing roller is made of new toner.

On the other hand in a layer deposited upon the first layer thus formed new toner Tn and old toner To are mixed together as shown in . This is because coating of the surface of the developing roller with a layer of new toner weakens the influence of the electrostatic force of the developing roller itself upon a layer over the new toner layer and the electric charge of new toner attracts other toner and hence attracts not only new toner but also old toner which has a lower charge level or is charged to the opposite polarity due to deterioration. In this specification the phenomenon that new toner is concentrated inside a layer near the surface of the developing roller whereas a layer far from this surface contains a lot of old toner will be referred to as layer separation phenomenon .

Meanwhile depending upon the electrostatic force of the developing roller and the charging characteristics of toner itself two or more layers of new toner may be formed on the surface of the developing roller as shown in . In such an instance as well new toner Tn and old toner To are mixed together in a layer far from the surface of the developing roller and layer separation phenomenon occurs.

As described above of toner layers formed on the surface of the developing roller in an outer layer far from the developing roller the rate of old toner To is higher. Old toner To only weakly adheres to the surface of the developing roller or to a toner layer on this surface since it has a low charge level. As a result old toner To falls off from the surface of the developing roller and scatters inside the apparatus while being transported by the rotation of the developing roller . Further toner charged to the polarity opposite to the intended polarity adheres to a region of an electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive member to which toner is not supposed to adhere and causes fog.

This model can explain the following experimental fact. For example when a developer containing only a little remaining toner after being used over a long period of time was filled with new toner the occurrence of toner scattering fog and the like temporarily increases but gradually decreases thereafter. The reason of this appears to be that mixing of a great amount of new toner with degraded toner inside the developer resulted in dominant presence of new toner near the surface of the developing roller and a large amount of old toner in the outer most surface of a toner layer. It appears that during continued use new toner would be selectively used which would reduce a difference of the characteristics of new toner from those of old toner relieve the layer separation phenomenon and eventually decrease the degree of toner scattering and the like.

This is backed by an experiment of replenishing toner of a different color from an original toner color. The surface of the developing roller was observed after replenishing yellow toner in the cyan developer C inside of which a remaining toner amount was small for instance. As a result a toner layer of a greenish color resulted from mixing of cyan toner and yellow toner was formed on the surface of the developing roller. However when the surface toner was removed with blown air through brushing off or by otherwise appropriate method the color of the surface of the developing roller changed to yellow gradually. To be noted in particular toner in the first layer directly contacting the surface of the developing roller had a yellow color which was almost the same as the original color of the yellow toner. On the other hand when the image forming operation was executed using this developer it was primarily cyan toner that was scattered around the developer or caused fog on the photosensitive member .

From these results it turns out that layer separation phenomenon occurs in which a layer near the surface of the developing roller is dominated by new toner whereas a layer far from the surface contains a large amount of old toner and that it is principally old toner that causes toner scattering and the like.

Meanwhile the terms new toner and old toner used herein express a concept regarding relative differences in terms of characteristics among toner particles inside the developer and therefore are not necessarily relevant to whether toner itself is fresh or not. For example even fresh toner may contain some amount of toner whose characteristics are inadequate like old toner described above in which case such toner would act like old toner . Further even toner which is not fresh toner can be considered to be new toner if relative differences in terms of characteristics among toner particles are small.

A similar phenomenon could occur even when the developers do not have slots for replenishing toner not to mention when the developers have such slots. In the case where the developer is partitioned into two or more chambers and toner is fed from one chamber to other chamber at a certain timing as in the embodiment for example new toner gets mixed with old toner at a timing of feeding of toner from one chamber to other chamber. Although no auger is provided inside the developers in this embodiment when the developer K . . . rotates in accordance with rotation of the rotary developer unit new toner stored in the first chamber flows into the second chamber which contains old toner at an increased ratio and gets mixed with the old toner. This remains unchanged in a structure where a toner transportation mechanism such as an auger is disposed inside a developer and a structure where toner is replenished regularly from a toner tank which is disposed separately from a developer.

The layer separation phenomenon described above is a notable problem where toner having a small particle diameter is used upon which van der Waals force acts strongly. When van der Waals force is weak toner would adhere to the surface of the developing roller mainly because of electrostatic attraction force and therefore old toner having a low charge level would not gather at the surface of the developing roller . In contrast when the action of van der Waals force is strong further toner would adhere to a toner layer on the developing roller regardless of the charge level of the further toner. Such toner inevitably contains a large amount of old toner thereby giving rise to layer separation phenomenon described above. In addition old toner would easily clump together due to van der Waals force and form a large toner block. Having a low charge level despite its particle diameter such a toner block tends to fall off from the surface of the developing roller and cause toner scattering and the like. It then follows that a problem attributable to layer separation phenomenon is particularly remarkable when toner T to use has a small particle diameter.

Consequently in this embodiment it is constructed such that the convex sections within the surface of the developing roller do not carry toner but the concave section alone carries a thin and uniform layer of new toner. The reason for not permitting the convex sections to carry toner is as follows. If the convex sections carry toner the toner may clump together due to pressurization by the restriction blade in a restriction nip and may fixedly adhere to the surface of the developing roller thereby causing filming or a block of thus clumped toner may get scattered to outside the developer. This is noticeable when the convex sections carry old toner and particularly remarkable when the toner T is small diameter toner having a volume average particle diameter of 5 m or less. To avoid this problem the restriction blade scrapes off toner which is carried by the convex sections within the surface of the developing roller .

Further carrying of toner only by the concave section achieves the following effect. Toner carried by the concave section is free from the pressure from or friction with the restriction blade and hence is less likely to clump together or deteriorate. This is advantageous in maintaining toner characteristics such as the charge level and the fluidity in mint condition for a long time. Production of old toner having deteriorated characteristics is suppressed and hence toner scattering and the like can be further suppressed.

As shown in the upstream side end of the elastic member is located on the upstream side in the rotation direction D of the developing roller relative to a perpendicular from the rotation center of the developing roller to the top surface of the elastic member . Hence the deformation Db of the elastic member owing to elastic deformation in the vicinity of the upstream side end is somewhat smaller than the maximum deformation Da of the elastic member in the vicinity of the foot of the perpendicular. The elastic member positioned like this contacts the developing roller in a wide area within the top surface of the elastic member which makes a restriction nip width Wn relatively wide.

While toner thus scraped off from above the convex sections contains both new and old toner toner removed from near the surfaces of the convex sections has a particularly high charge level. This is because toner which used to adhere to the surfaces of the convex sections is almost entirely new toner which exhibits an excellent charging characteristic and its charge level increases due to friction with and rolling by the restriction blade during removal from the convex sections and therefore strong electrostatic force which attracts the toner toward the developing roller acts upon this toner. Meanwhile on the upstream in the moving direction D of the abutting position with the restriction blade that is on the left hand side in old toner having a low charge level as well is present. When the toner scraped off from near the convex sections and having a high charge level collides with such old toner new toner Tn and Tn having high charge levels flip old toner To and To on the upstream side having low charge levels. The old toner present in the vicinity of the surface of the developing roller is gradually replaced with the new toner Tn and is driven away toward the upstream side. As a result within the restriction nip N and on the downstream side to the restriction nip N in the rotation direction D of the developing roller the concave section alone carries toner and this toner contains the old toner at an extremely low rate.

To facilitate this phenomenon the edge surface of the upstream side end of the elastic member is preferably an upright wall which is approximately perpendicular to the surface of the developing roller . When the angle of the edge of the elastic member is an acute angle toner which has been scraped off is pulled away from the surface of the developing roller and therefore replacement of old toner with new toner described above will not occur easily Meanwhile when the angle is an obtuse angle toner which has been scraped off is pushed into the restriction nip N and pressed there. When the angle is around 90 degrees toner which has been scraped off stays near the upstream side end of the elastic member promoting toner replacement.

Next the height difference between the convex sections and the concave section within the surface of the developing roller will be discussed. In this embodiment toner on the convex sections is removed by the contact with the restriction blade and toner is carried only by the concave section . The amount of toner carried by the concave section therefore determines the amount of toner transported to the opposed position facing the photosensitive member . The height difference is thus important in securing an excellent image quality.

The first layer of toner contacting the surface of the developing roller adheres to the developing roller with strong electrostatic force. However electrostatic force acting upon toner in the second and farther layers adhering on the first toner layer is weaker than this electrostatic force and therefore the toner in the second and farther layers can easily go off from the developing roller and play a major role for development of an electrostatic latent image at the opposed position facing the photosensitive member . In other words with the second and farther toner layers formed in the concave section in this manner the development efficiency is better than where the concave section carries only one toner layer. This is particularly effective where toner having a small particle diameter for instance a volume average particle diameter of 5 m or less is used whose adhesion among toner particles due to van der Waals force is strong. The distance between the concave section and the elastic member is preferably twice the volume average particle diameter Dave of toner or larger. However since old toner will get mixed in if the distance is too long the distance should properly be triple the volume average particle diameter Dave of toner or less. In short the distance should satisfy the following formula Dave G1 3 Dave Formula 1 

This is particularly preferable with respect to toner among which a toner particle diameter does not vary greatly.

It is preferable that the concave section within the surface of the developing roller carry two or more toner layers so as to secure a sufficient development efficiency. That is the following formula needs be satisfied 2 Dave G1 Formula 1a 

In the meantime considering variations of a toner particle diameter the distance G between the concave section and the elastic member may be equal to or larger than the diameter of the largest toner particles Tm among toner T as shown in . The maximum particle diameter of toner can be defined as described below in accordance with statistics. In other words the maximum particle diameter Dm can be defined by the following formula 50 3 Formula 2 

where the symbol D denotes the 50 particle diameter at the quantity standard of toner T and the symbol denotes the geometrical standard deviation. In toner which is normally used the proportion of toner whose particle diameter exceeds the maximum particle diameter Dm is extremely small.

When the distance between the concave section and the elastic member is small toner having a large particle diameter trapped in the concave section gets pressed by the elastic member and deteriorates. In addition toner having other large particle diameter could stay indefinitely within the developer without getting fed to the concave section so that the particle diameter distribution of toner will gradually shift toward the large diameter side to the extent not usable for development. When the distance between the concave section and the elastic member is equal to or larger than the maximum particle diameter Dm as described above the concave section can carry almost all toner particles contained in toner T held inside the developer which makes it possible to use all toner inside the developer to the very end. That is the following formula needs be satisfied 250 3 Formula 3 

Toner Tm having the maximum particle diameter may be made carried on the first toner layer which the concave section carries as shown in . In short the distance G between the concave section and the elastic member may be determined so as to satisfy the following formula 3 Dave Dave 50 3 Formula 4 

Since this makes it possible to carry even such toner Tm which has the maximum particle diameter on top of a toner layer which is in contact with the developing roller it is possible to use large diameter toner efficiently for development.

As described above in this embodiment the restriction blade scrapes off within the restriction nip N toner carried by the convex sections within the surface of the developing roller so that the concave section alone carries toner. This suppresses pressurization of toner in the restriction nip N and hence clumping and degrading of toner. Since toner is prevented from degrading it is possible to reduce scattering of toner to outside the developer from the developing roller which is caused mainly by degraded toner. Further the upstream side edge surface of the restriction blade is formed as an upright wall which is approximately perpendicular to the surface of the developing roller and toner which has been scraped off stays at the wall. Accordingly old toner trapped inside the concave section is replaced with new toner thereby lowering the proportion of old toner contained in a toner layer. This reduces the amount of old toner which is transported to outside the developer and further improves the effect of suppressing toner scattering fog etc.

Next an image forming apparatus of a second embodiment according to the invention will now be described. In the apparatus of the second embodiment the restriction blade abuts on the developing roller in a different fashion from the first embodiment. Structures and operations other than this are the same as those in the first embodiment. Structures common between the first and the second embodiments will not be described but will be simply denoted at the same reference symbols and differences of the second embodiment from the first embodiment will be described in principle.

This relationship holds true also when there is only one concave section which is enclosed within the restriction nip and the amount of the bending decreases with a distance toward the downstream side even within one concave section .

The elastic member bulging toward the concave section allows transportation of a toner layer whose thickness corresponds to the distance between the front edge of the elastic member and the bottom of the concave section from among a plurality of toner layers carried by the concave section but blocks the other toner layers. However the amount of the bending decreases toward the downstream side in the rotation direction D of the developing roller as described above. Hence the pressure applied upon toner will not rise within the restriction nip and toner will not fixedly adhere to the bottom of the concave section . In addition although a toner layer arriving at the restriction nip may get pressurized as it further proceeds toward the downstream side and deformation and fixing of toner to each other may occur when the distance between the front edge of the elastic member and the bottom of the concave section is longer than on the downstream side the structure above avoids this problem.

With such a structure as well since the restriction blade removes toner on the convex sections it is possible to prevent degradation of toner due to pressing like in the first embodiment described earlier. It is also possible to replace old toner in the concave section with new toner and to reduce the amount of old toner which is transported to outside the developer. Therefore the apparatus in the second embodiment as well is capable of suppressing toner scattering fog and the like as in the first embodiment. Further the consideration upon the height difference between the convex sections and the concave section provided in the first embodiment is valid for this embodiment as well.

As described above in the embodiments above the developer K . . . correspond to the developer apparatus of the invention. The housing the developing roller and the restriction blade function respectively as the container the toner carrier roller and the restriction member of the invention. The elastic member attached to the restriction blade functions as the elastic abutting member of the invention. Further in the embodiments above the first chamber and the second chamber within the developer K . . . correspond to the toner storage chamber and the rotary developer unit which rotates the entire developer and accordingly feeds toner inside the first chamber to the second chamber functions as the toner transportation mechanism of the invention. In addition in the image forming apparatuses in the embodiments above the photosensitive member and the developer K . . . function respectively as the image carrier and the developer .

It should be noted that the invention is not limited to the embodiments above but may be modified in various manners in addition to the embodiments above to the extent not deviating from the object of the invention. For example although the convex sections of the developing roller are lozenge shaped in the above embodiments this is not limiting. The convex sections may be shaped differently such as circles and triangles for instance.

Although the developing roller is metallic cylinder in the above embodiments the invention is also applicable to an apparatus comprising a developing roller made of other material. However experiments performed by the inventors of the invention have identified that layer separation phenomenon described above would be remarkable when a developing roller whose surface is made of a conductive material such as a metallic developing roller and a developing roller made of non metal with metal plating thereon is used. Hence the invention would be very effective when applied to an apparatus comprising a developing roller which has such a conductive surface. In this respect the invention is also effective to an apparatus comprising a developing roller which is made conductive by dispersing a conductive material such as carbon black and metallic fine powder in a cylinder made of rubber resin or the like for instance.

Further although the restriction blade is prepared by attaching the elastic member made of resin to a plate like member made of metal in the embodiment above this structure is not limiting. The restriction blade may be a metal plate coated with elastic resin for example. In addition an appropriate bias potential may be applied to the restriction blade.

Although toner used in the embodiments above is not particularly limited the effect of the invention is remarkable when monocomponent toner whose change in charging characteristics with time is relatively great is used. Further application of the invention to an apparatus which uses toner whose average particle diameter is small is effective since such toner gives rise to a serious problem of toner scattering and the like. From the viewpoint of improving the resolution of an image and reducing toner consumption demand for toner having a smaller particle diameter has been increased in recent years and fine powder toner having a volume average particle diameter of 5 m or less has come to be manufactured. While such fine powder toner easily causes toner scattering and the like those problems can be solved by applying the invention.

The effect of the invention is particularly remarkable for use of toner in which the particle diameter of an additive added to the toner is 50 nm or less and a coverage factor of the additive on a surface of the toner particle is 100 or more. Such toner containing an additive has a tendency that its fluidity is high initially but changes greatly with time and becomes significantly low during use over a long period of time. Application of the invention to such toner is effective since such toner easily causes layer separation phenomenon due to a difference in fluidity between new toner and old toner.

The image forming apparatus in the above embodiment is a color image forming apparatus in which the developers K . . . are attached to the rotary developer unit and toner inside the developers is mixed when the developers K . . . rotate. However the application of the invention is not limited to this as mentioned earlier. The invention is also applicable to a monochromatic image forming apparatus which includes only one developer and forms a monochromatic image for example. Particularly the invention is favorably applied to an apparatus which is capable of replenishing toner by a user or an operator through a replenishing slot which is provided in the developer and to an apparatus which is structured that toner is regularly replenished from a toner tank and the like separately provided from the developer

In an embodiment according to the invention for instance a height difference between the convex sections and the concave section may be equal to or larger than a volume average particle diameter of toner the restriction member may include an elastic abutting member which is formed by an elastic material is pressed against the surface of the toner carrier roller to form the restriction nip and an upstream side end of the elastic abutting member in the rotation direction of the toner carrier roller may abut on the convex sections of the toner carrier roller to scrape off toner on the convex sections.

In this structure the concave section can carry one toner layer or more while the elastic abutting member scrapes off toner on the convex sections. Of toner thus scraped off highly charged toner pushes out old toner which is carried by the toner carrier roller at an upstream side of the restriction nip in the rotation direction of the toner carrier roller. Due to this effect at a downstream side of the restriction nip the concave section alone carries toner which contains only a small proportion of old toner thereby suppressing toner scattering fog and the like. Here it is preferable that the top surfaces of the convex sections form a part of the same cylindrical surface that is the enveloping surface formed by the top surfaces of the convex sections is one cylindrical surface. With such a structure since the toner carrier roller can be regarded as a rotating cylinder in broad perspective it is possible to maintain the abutting pressure of this cylinder on the restriction member constant in the circumferential direction of the cylinder. Further the top surfaces of the respective convex sections may be flat.

In this structure it is desirable that an upstream side edge surface of the elastic abutting member in the rotation direction of the toner carrier roller is upright approximately perpendicularly to the surface of the toner carrier roller. This prevents toner adhering to the convex sections from getting dragged into the restriction nip and pressed to clump together by the elastic abutting member or fixed to the surface of the toner carrier roller. Further toner which the elastic abutting member has scraped off from the surface of the toner carrier roller stays near the upstream side edge surface of the elastic abutting member and hence replacement of old toner with new toner within the surface of the toner carrier roller is promoted. Therefore a ratio of old toner remaining on the surface of the toner carrier roller after restriction can be further reduced.

Here a distance between the elastic abutting member and the concave section in the restriction nip may be the same as the volume average particle diameter of toner through triple the volume average particle diameter of toner. When the distance between the elastic abutting member and the concave section in the restriction nip is equal to or larger than the volume average particle diameter of toner it is possible for the concave section to carry one toner layer without fail. Meanwhile if the distance between the elastic abutting member and the concave section is excessively large the concave section carries a great amount of toner and the amount of old toner contained in this toner is large. Consequently the distance between the elastic abutting member and the concave section may for instance be up to triple the volume average particle diameter of toner thereby properly limiting the amount of toner which the concave section carries.

Alternatively a distance between the elastic abutting member and the concave section in the restriction nip may be equal to or larger than a maximum particle diameter of toner. For example the maximum particle diameter of toner can be defined as a value which is calculated by adding triple the geometrical standard deviation to the 50 particle diameter at the quantity standard in a toner particle diameter distribution. This is because a particle diameter variation is small in currently manufactured toner and the ratio of toner particles whose particle diameters exceed this value is extremely low in toner which is commercially available today. This structure makes it possible for the toner carrier roller to carry almost all new toner which is housed in the container and hence prevents retention of large diameter toner within the container.

For instance the distance between the elastic abutting member and the concave section in the restriction nip may be equal to or larger than a sum of the volume average particle diameter of toner and the maximum particle diameter of toner. This makes it possible to carry one toner layer on the surface of the concave section and further carry toner particles whose diameters are the largest and hence prevents a problem that the elastic abutting member presses large diameter toner trapped in the concave section and this toner gets degraded or aggregated. In addition it is possible to make the large diameter toner efficiently contribute to development.

Further a deformation amount or deformation volume of the elastic abutting member which abuts on the toner carrier roller and gets elastically deformed is preferably the greatest at the upstream side end of the elastic abutting member in the rotation direction of the toner carrier roller. The elastic abutting member abuts on the surface of the toner carrier roller under pressure and hence the elastic abutting member gets elastically deformed. Describing this in more detail the elastic abutting member is pressed against the surfaces of the convex sections and thus pressed sections elastically bend and hence the thickness of the elastic abutting member reduces in a direction orthogonal to the surface of the toner carrier roller The deformation volume of the elastic abutting member in the invention is indicative of this reduction of the thickness. In microscopic perspective the amount of shrinkage of the elastic abutting member at a section of the elastic abutting member opposed against the concave section of the toner carrier roller is smaller than the amount of shrinkage at sections pressed against the convex sections. In short in the space above the concave section the surface of the elastic abutting member bends toward the bottom of the concave section. The elastic abutting member bending in this manner presses toner which is carried by the concave section. The amount of bending of the elastic abutting member in the space above the concave section is considered to increase as the deformation volume of the elastic abutting member taken in broad perspective increases. Further the larger the deformation volume of the elastic abutting member is the greater the abutting pressure upon the convex sections is.

Here with the deformation volume of the elastic abutting member reaching its maximum at the upstream side end of the elastic abutting member in the rotation direction of the toner carrier roller as described above the abutting pressure upon the convex sections becomes greatest at the upstream side end of the restriction nip which makes it possible to remove toner from the convex sections even more securely. In addition since the amount of bending of the elastic abutting member toward the concave section decreases within the restriction nip with a distance to the downstream side the pressure upon toner carried by the concave section becomes weaker on the downstream side within the restriction nip. Hence it is possible to prevent unwanted pressure from applying upon toner.

In the respective developer apparatuses described above the surface of the toner carrier roller may be made of a conductive material. According to experiments performed by the inventors of the invention the layer separation phenomenon above namely the phenomenon that a layer mainly containing new toner and a layer mainly containing old toner are layered one atop the other on the surface of the toner carrier roller is particularly obvious when the surface of the toner carrier roller is made of a conductive material. Application of the concept of the invention to a developer apparatus having such a structure would be more effective.

The effect of the invention is also remarkable when the container includes a slot for replenishing toner from outside. A developer apparatus having such a structure could give rise to a phenomenon that a great amount of new toner is introduced through the slot upon old toner which has been used for long time and is stored inside the container. The above layer separation phenomenon would easily occur in such an instance thereby causing toner scattering fog and the like. Application of the concept of the invention to a developer apparatus having such a structure would suppress toner scattering fog and the like.

This remains unchanged in a structure which comprises a toner transportation mechanism wherein the container includes a plurality of toner storage chambers which store toner the surface of the toner carrier roller is at least partially exposed inside one of the toner storage chambers and the toner transportation mechanism transports toner housed in other toner storage chamber to the one toner storage chamber. This is because new toner is fed onto old toner which is present near the toner carrier roller from other toner storage chamber in this structure as well.

Further the invention is significantly effective where toner whose volume average particle diameter is 5 m or less is used or where such toner is used in which the particle diameter of an additive added to the toner for the purpose of improving the fluidity of the toner is 50 nm or less and the coverage or coverage factor of the additive on a surface of toner particles is 100 or higher. When the volume average particle diameter of toner is 5 m or less for instance van der Waals force among toner particles intensifies and therefore it is easy for old toner to adhere to a toner layer which is on the toner carrier roller. Since old toner tends to get scattered or cause fog even in this situation the effect of the invention is great. Further since the fluidity of toner to which such an additive has been added significantly changes with time and layer separation phenomenon would easily occur in the toner application of the invention is very effective.

Various modifications of the disclosed embodiment as well as other embodiments of the present invention will become apparent to persons skilled in the art upon reference to the description of the invention. It is therefore contemplated that the appended claims will cover any such modifications or embodiments as fall within the true scope of the invention.
