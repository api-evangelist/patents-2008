The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The present invention relates to underwater communications and more specifically to a high speed underwater data transmission system and method of utilizing arrays of nanometer scaled photon emitters and sensors.

There exists a need for enhancing underwater data transmission rates especially in the area of underwater environmental and situational awareness. Developmental plans envision platforms and data centers as being part of a network with vast amounts of time varying information being exchanged among the data cells or centers and built in redundancy for providing robust systems. Arrays of autonomous platforms can be envisaged to work in herds that share information. These emerging systems can reach their full potential only if underwater data transmission rates improve.

On land in air and in space data transmissions have reached high rates due to the availability of earth orbiting satellites and fiber optic cables and lasers. The data transmission typically reaches or exceeds rates of 100 Megabits second Mbits s .

In comparison underwater communications have been described as primitive with underwater transmission rates based on sound waves being approximately 56 kilobits second kbps .

Typically transducers called hydrophones are used to transmit sound waves. However the sound waves are transmitted in all directions and reflect from the sea floor the surface and interfere with one another thereby garbling the acoustic waves. As such sophisticated signal processing techniques are required to provide stable and secured acoustic communication. A different approach to underwater communication is needed if underwater data transmission rates are to be similar to those of fiber optic cable.

It is therefore a general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide a communication system and method of use in underwater environments in which the system provides enhanced data transmission rates.

The object of the present invention is attained by providing one or more arrays of nanometer scaled photon emitters and sensors on an outer surface of an underwater platform. The emitters and sensors are lensed to send and receive single photons at precise frequencies.

For the emitters a laser pulsed to correlate with the data packets provides a coherent collimated beam of photons at a prescribed frequency. The sensors include a plurality of nano scale collecting lenses or tubes having interior pigment coatings to absorb photons. The coating of each lens or tube absorbs photons that are not aligned with the longitudinal axes of the lens or tube. A photo receptor is located at the focal plane for the prescribed light frequency at the base of each lens or tube.

Nano wires connect the photo receptors to a light intensity integrator. Each nano wire has a plurality of atoms per unit cell to provide for redundant conductance channels in case of defects. The light intensity integrator integrates the light intensity over a given surface area. The output of the light intensity integrator is fed to an intensity time signal processor to track and process the arriving digital packets.

In one embodiment a system for underwater data transmission comprises a photon source providing a beam of electromagnetic radiation at a predetermined frequency the beam being pulsed to encode the data an array of photo receptors configured to collect electromagnetic radiation of the predetermined frequency at least one integrator in communication with a plurality of photo receptors of the array of photo receptors the integrator receiving signals from said plurality of photo receptors corresponding to an intensity of electromagnetic radiation collected by the plurality of photo receptors and integrating the intensity over the plurality of photo receptors and a signal processor in communication with the integrator the signal processor receiving signals from the integrator corresponding to the integrated intensity and determining the transmitted data based on an intensity time track of the integrated intensity for the pulsed beam of electromagnetic radiation at the predetermined frequency.

In one variation each photo receptor comprises an elongated collecting lens having an optical opening therein to collect electromagnetic radiation in a direction aligned with a longitudinal axis of the opening. A coating on an interior surface of the opening absorbs electromagnetic radiation of the predetermined frequency. The lens may be a carbon nano tube.

Each photo receptor may comprise a nano scale photo receptor spaced apart from the lens a distance corresponding to a focal plane for the electromagnetic radiation of the predetermined frequency. A nano scale photo receptor may comprise at least one sensing molecule selected to emit at least one electron upon absorbing electromagnetic radiation of the predetermined frequency. A plurality of nano wires connected to the nano scale photo receptor and the integrator may transmit the electrons to the integrator. A protective coating may cover the front surface of the photo receptors such that the electromagnetic radiation passes through the protective coating prior to entering the photo receptors. A protective coating may also cover the rear surface of the photo receptors remote from the front surface.

In another variation portions of the array of photo receptors are activated in a sequence such that the signal processor can determine a direction of the pulsed beam based on which portion of the array has a maximum intensity for the pulsed beam. In a further variation the system comprises attitude sensors and alignment mirrors at both the photon source and photo receptors such that the positions of the alignment mirrors are controlled by the attitude sensors to maintain alignment of the pulsed beam between the photon source and the photo receptors.

In one embodiment a photo receptor collects electromagnetic radiation of a predetermined frequency. The photo receptor includes a carbon nano tube collecting lens to collect electromagnetic radiation in a direction aligned with a longitudinal axis of the lens a coating on an interior surface of the lens to absorb electromagnetic radiation of the predetermined frequency and a nano scale photo receptor spaced apart from the lens a distance corresponding to a focal plane for the electromagnetic radiation. At least one sensing molecule of the nano scale photo receptor is selected so as to emit one or more electrons upon absorbing the electromagnetic radiation.

In one variation the photo receptor includes a plurality of nano wires connected to said nano scale photo receptor and said integrator for transmitting the electrons to an integrator for integrating intensities of electromagnetic radiation of the predetermined frequency collected over a plurality of photo receptors. A first protective coating may cover the collecting lens in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis such that the electromagnetic radiation passes through said protective coating prior to entering the collecting lens. The coating can be transparent to the electromagnetic radiation of the predetermined frequency. A protective coating may also cover a rear surface of the photo receptors remote from the first protective coating.

In one embodiment a method determines a direction of a signal source arriving at an array of photo receptors. The signal source includes a photon beam of a predetermined frequency and the photo receptors collect photons of the predetermined frequency from a direction aligned with the photo receptors. The beam is pulsed to encode data. The method includes activating one portion of the array of photo receptors comprising a plurality of contiguous photo receptors determining over a time period an intensity of photons collected by the activated portion corresponding to pulses of photons sequentially activating overlapping portions of the array of photo receptors and determining intensities integrating the intensities over the array to determine the overlapping portion or portions having the peak intensities and performing a limited activation sequence about the overlapping portions of peak intensities to refine the direction of the signal source.

In yet another variation of the present invention the method includes coordinating results for peak intensities from a plurality of arrays and re orienting the plurality of arrays to enhance the peak intensities based on the coordinated results.

Referring now to there is shown a schematic of a system for underwater data communication or transmission. A coherent collimated laser source positioned on an outer surface of an underwater emitter platform emits a photon beam to a photo receptor on an outer surface of an underwater receiver platform . The photon or laser beam is pulsed to form data packets in the manner of fiber optic light data communications known to those ordinarily skilled in the art. The frequency of laser beam is predetermined between the emitter and the receiver platform . All other frequencies are identified as noise and are un correlated. The frequency may be chosen to minimize the absorption of the laser beam as the beam travels through the intervening medium from the emitter to the receiver . For purposes of discussion and illustration of communications in sea water the laser source preferably emits blue light at 475 nano meters nm since the absorption of blue light in sea water is known to be low. However other frequencies of electro magnetic radiation may be contemplated without limitation.

At this point discussion of bio sensors provides a further understanding of the operation and feasibility of the system . The response dynamics of a retina of a living organism match the habitat and lifestyle of the organism both in oceanic and terrestrial environments. Research exists on the spatial and temporal visual sensitivities of organisms that can be applied to data communication between underwater platforms. As is known to those of skill in the art temporal sensitivity is measured by Flicker Fusion Frequency FFF . FFF is low for night active organisms 10 60 Hz while FFF is higher for rapidly moving and day active species 200 300 Hz . Spatial resolution is known to be more dependent on temporal properties of the photo receptor cells than on the structural optics of the eye. Therefore for an underwater system of vision for data communication both spatial and temporal properties of the photo receptor cells should be taken into account.

Deep sea animals have evolved to perceive bioluminescent flashes at distances of 100 200 meters m and do not use scant downwelling sun light. The intensity of typical bioluminescent flashes varies between 10and 10W mat a distance of 1 m. Such a bioluminescent blue source 475 nm would produce approximately 3 10to about 1 10photons every second. For reference such a flash is about one tenth of a 1 milliwatt mW blue laser operating at 0.1 efficiency in photon count. Flashes are typically between 0.2 5.0 seconds long. The total number of photons E in one flash would range between 6 10photons for a dim short flash to approximately 2 10photons for a bright and long flash.

The number of photons N from a flash containing photons E that enter an eye of pupil diameter A at a distance r from the flash is known to be 

It has been found that a deep sea fish needs about five photons for threshold perception of a blue flash. If the pupil diameter is 7.3 3.7 mm flash intensity is 10photons N 5 photons and 0.05 m then the maximum distance r at which the flash can be perceived is about 34 m. For a brighter flash the largest fish pupil has a maximum range of visibility of about 150 m. While larger eyes would allow an underwater organism to perceive a bioluminescent flash i.e. detect prey at a greater distance the evolution of fish vision is also related to swimming speed. For distances greater than about 150 m the survival advantage conferred to an organism by having greater distance perception of a bioluminescent flash is limited as it would take too long for the organism to travel to the target.

However for the system the receiver can be sized to suit design requirements. For illustration purposes but not limitation the eye pupil diameter of the photo receptor can be taken at 10 m. Using Equation 1 and holding the other parameters the same as provided above the range r for a pupil diameter of 10 m is about 167 m for a dim bioluminescent flash 10photons second and 366 m for a bright bioluminescent flash 10photons second . This range corresponds to a littoral area of interest for satellite ship sub communications.

A coherent and collimated laser source such as the laser source of is more suitable for communications than for a bioluminescent source. For illustrative purposes but not limitation a 1 Watt W blue laser 475 nm can be considered. The number of photons emitted by such a laser operating at 100 efficiency can be determined to be about 2.4 e based on N P hc where P is power in watts h is Plancks constant and c is the speed of light. For a 1 mW laser the number of photons would be about 2.4 e. Using Equation 1 range estimations for 1 W and 1 mW blue lasers of more practical efficiencies of 0.10 1 10 and 30 are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. Again a minimum photon count of 5 is used. Two detection area diameters are considered 1 meter m and 1 millimeter mm .

The above estimations suggest that high bandwidth data communication is theoretically possible at distances of 78 m to up to 530 m depending on laser efficiency laser power and sensor detection area. As previously noted this range is of interest for communications in acoustically and optically disturbed shallow water areas also referred herein as littoral areas. Thus in a worst case a 1 mW laser source operating at 0.1 efficiency and emitting from the skin or the outer surface of the emitter platform such as a manned or unmanned underwater vehicle UUV would be detectable with 1 mm diameter sensors or photo receptors in the depth distance range of 78 m. Such laser and sensor scales are well suited to nano micro and laser technologies.

Referring to there is illustrated a top planar view of a portion of the outer surface of receiver showing photo receptors of . Consider a blue laser beam reaching the skin or the outer surface of the receiver . The photo receptors comprise dense clusters of nano scale collecting lens . A portion of a cluster is shown in in a hexagonal configuration of lenses for illustration and not limitation and other packing configurations are possible. Each lens can be fabricated from a carbon nano tube with a pigment coating to prevent the exemplary blue light from escaping circumferentially.

Referring to a cross sectional view of the surface of taken at line of is illustrated. In the cross section the outer surface comprises the collecting lenses nano scale photo receptors light intensity integrators and signal processors . As in pigment coating on carbon nano tube can prevent the exemplary blue light from escaping circumferentially. In this manner photons along longitudinal axes X X of lenses are preferentially collected.

Compared to other photo receptive systems the assembly of optical and opto electronic subsystems as further described herein may reduce the number of electronic components while increasing optical performance thereby minimizing electronic resistance losses and noise. The photo receptor clusters are sandwiched between protective coatings and . The protective coatings and are coating materials that can be sprayed on after assembly of the subsystem of the collecting lenses nano scale photo receptors light intensity integrators and signal processors so as to provide transparent scratch resistant and flexible nanoscale thickness coatings. For illustration and not limitation the total sandwich thickness of the outer surface may be in the range of 1 mm. Additionally the integrators the processors or both may be encompassed between the coatings and as illustrated in or may be an outside protective coating

The nano scale photo receptors in are located a distance from the collecting lens corresponding to the focal plane of the wavelength of the incoming laser light so as to provide preferential collection of the photons of interest. For the exemplary blue lasers the photo receptors are located at the focal plane of 465 nm light. Each nano scale photo receptor converts received photons to electrons which travel down atomic length conductive nano wires to the light intensity integrator . Preferentially the nano wires have multiple numbers of atoms per unit cell e.g. four or more atoms to allow for redundancy in case of fabrication defects.

The light intensity integrator integrates the light intensity over a given surface area of the outer surface or number of the nano scale photo receptors . The output of the integrator is fed to signal processor to track the digital photon packets arriving. Signal processor can be configured to process intensity time variations of the output of the integrator as will be explained in further detail herein. The fabrication and operation of the photo receptors the integrator and the signal processor may be based on currently available technologies. The light intensity integrators may be similar to known charge coupled device CCD integrators.

The working principle of the present invention is shown in through . illustrates incoming streams of photons of various colors of lights illustrated as differing sizes arriving at the nano scale photo receptor but in an incoherent time stream . In the nano scale photo receptor comprises silicon Si substrates conducting substrate and sensing molecules . The sensing molecules are sensitive to the frequency of coherent light selected for communication. For the exemplary blue light the molecules are sensitive to 475 nm blue light.

In the example of only some of the photons are 475 nm blue light which arrive from scattered light and not from a definite point source such as the emitter platform . Additionally the stream lacks any pre determined stream of deterministic data packets to broadcast that a friend is trying to make contact sitting at a precise range. This leads to an intensity time signature shown in upper trace of . For comparison a high resolution of an atomic clock trace is shown below the upper trace . The intensities of upper trace are non uniform and appear randomly in time sequence.

On the other hand as shown in and a communication from a friend results in the deterministic incoming stream of blue photons submerged in the noise of the background of scattered lights the streams and photons . In the photons arrive in packets and with a time interval between the packets. Such packets having intensities and their arrival times as shown on trace of can provide meaningful information.

To determine the direction of a source as by the plot of areas of the nano scale photo receptors such as exemplary area of are activated in sequence. The sequence of activation is that of a spiraling scan as shown by track which progresses in the direction of arrow .

Other activation sequences and configurations of the exemplary area may be contemplated without limitation. For example a longitudinal span of nano scale photo receptors may be activated and progress circumferentially about the cylindrical body. As each area is activated in the selected sequence the intensity of the incoming electromagnetic radiation of interest is determined as illustrated in and . Integrating these intensity readings results in a plot such as that of . Once the general location of a peak intensity is determined a limited activation sequence about the general location using a reduced area of activated nano scale photo receptors can be performed to further refine the direction of a source. A similar activation sequence can be utilized for the laser sources of the emitter platform such that the laser beam is emitted in all directions. By increasing the size of the area of the effective area for receiving photons is increased such that the distance range of data communication may be enhanced.

For an end section of the receiver platform a pie shaped sector such as an area may be activated and progress rotationally about an axis of the receiver platform. The peak intensity may be located in the manner described for the area . As noted with respect to the exemplary area other activation sequences and configurations of the area may be contemplated without limitation. Once peak intensities have been located the results for the areas and may be coordinated to better refine the direction of a source. For example a stronger peak intensity from the end section than from the area may indicate that rotation or reorientation of the receiver platform is necessary to obtain the strongest signal. Generally reorientation is performed to provide the maximum number of photo receptors aligned with the beam source.

If no other scanning sequences have been performed as determined at localization of the selected area is carried out to refine the direction of a signal source block . If the results of other scanning sequences are available the results of all scanning sequences are coordinated block to determine if an adjustment in orientation of the platform block would enhance the received signal. If not the method proceeds to localization as at block . If so a reorientation is performed block prior to proceeding to block . Upon refining the direction at block the method locks onto the localized peak block to maintain the communication channel.

Based on current communications technologies the systems and methods described herein may increase underwater data communication rates by a factor in the range of a thousand. The systems and methods are applicable to both deep ocean and within littoral 100 200 m depths. While having both the emitter platform and the receiver platform within the ocean environment the systems and methods are equally applicable to communications between airborne platforms and shallow water submerged platforms. Combined with the enhanced data communication rate communications with airborne platforms may provide global positioning system capabilities to underwater platforms.

What have thus been described are communication systems and methods for use in underwater environments that provide enhanced data transmission rates. Arrays of nanometer scaled photon emitters and sensors may be provided on outer surfaces of underwater platforms. The emitters and sensors are lensed to send and receive single photons at precise frequencies. The laser source emitters are pulsed to correlate with data packets. The sensors include a plurality of nano scale collecting lenses that preferentially absorb photons at the prescribed frequency.

One or more light intensity integrators integrate the received light intensity over given surface areas. The output of the light intensity integrators is fed to one or more intensity time signal processors to track and process the photonic digital packets arriving at the photo receptors. Sequenced activation of the emitters provides dispersal of the photons throughout the medium while sequenced activation of the sensors provides a method for determining the direction of incoming photonic communication.

Obviously many modifications and variations of the present invention may become apparent in light of the above teachings. For example resonant cavities can be used to increase efficiency of photo detector signal. Wires connecting the nano scale photo receptors may be nano manufactured placing a few atoms of copper gold or such conductors therein. Existing commercial off the shelf COTS technologies may be combined with nano tech receiving sensors such as for the integrators and signal processors. The emitters may also employ non nanotech coherent lasers such as solid state lasers may be used. In addition current digital communication software may be ported for use in signal processing.

It will be understood that many additional changes in details materials steps and arrangements of parts which have been described herein and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.
