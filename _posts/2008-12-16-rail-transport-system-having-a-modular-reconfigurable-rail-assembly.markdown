This invention was made with Government support under Contract No. N00024 03 C 5115 awarded by the Department of the Navy. The Government has certain rights in this invention.

This invention relates to transport systems and more particularly to rail transport systems having a modular reconfigurable rail assembly which allows for guided movement thereon of one or more rail mounted transport devices.

When cabinets and equipment need to be moved into and out of a combat space on a Navy ship the false deck and associated gridwork must be protected because it is not designed to support the weight of the cabinets and equipment being installed in the space.

A current method for moving cabinets and equipment into or out of the combat space involves fabricating a temporary platform to roll the cabinets and equipment over the false deck and associated gridwork. Immobile rigging equipment including for example chain falls are secured to the overhead structure to lift equipment and cabinets and install rollers underneath.

The above method provides for slow and inefficient transport of the cabinet and equipment. Moreover the temporary platform negatively impacts the ship s structure and other systems.

Accordingly an improved method is needed for transporting cabinets and equipment into and out of a combat space on a Navy ship.

Disclosed herein is a rail transport system comprising a rail assembly including at least two rail modules at least one angled tongue element disposed at an end of the at least two rail modules and at least one angled groove element disposed at an end of the other one of the at least two rail modules the at least one angled groove element for receiving the at least one angled tongue element when the at least two rail modules are assembled together.

Also disclosed herein is a method for moving articles into and out of a combat space on a ship the method comprising the steps of suspending a rail transport system above a false deck of the ship the rail transport system including rail assembly and a transport device movable along the rail assembly at a location remote from the combat space attaching one of the articles to the transport device moving the transport device along the rail assembly to the combat space and detaching the article from the transport device at the combat space.

The rail transport systems shown in each includes one or more rail mounted devices including but not limited to trolleys and carriers that move along the rail transport system to quickly and efficiently move cabinets and equipment into and out of a combat space of a Naval ship without damaging the ship s false deck and associated grillwork which are not capable of supporting the weight of the cabinets and other equipment being moved into the combat space. The rail transport system may also be used for the following purposes including but not limited to transporting product through manufacturing processes delivering articles within warehousing and distribution systems delivering articles in mail and package sorting and delivery systems to name a few.

The rail assembly includes a plurality of rail modules and a plurality of rail joining arrangements . The rail modules of the rail assembly may be straight curved and combinations thereof. Each rail joining arrangement interconnects opposing ends of two of the rail modules . In one embodiment as shown in each of the rail modules is unitary in construction and has an I shape cross section formed by a vertical web member extending along the longitudinal axis of the rail module a horizontal upper flange member extending along a top of the web member and a horizontal lower flange member extending along the bottom of the web member . The rail modules are preferably formed from a high strength aluminum alloy material including but not limited to 2014 2024 and 7075 by extruding the aluminum alloy to a desired cross section and length. The aluminum alloy construction provides for light weight rail modules . The rail modules may also be formed from other high strength light weight alloys and other high strength light weight materials.

The lower ends of the strut rods are removably connected to the upper flange members of the rail modules as shown for example in . Removable connection may be achieved in one embodiment by providing a slotted coupler at the lower end of each strut rod which is configured and adapted to slidably receive the upper flange and vertical web members of the rail modules .

As shown in the lower flange member of each rail module defines a first horizontal riding surface and a first vertical riding surface on a first side of the vertical web member . The lower flange member further defines a second horizontal riding surface and a second vertical riding surface on a second side of the vertical web member . In various applications of the rail assembly the rail engaging devices e.g. trolleys and carriers may engage various combinations of the several riding surfaces as the application dictates. Although not shown electrical conductors for communicating power control data signals and the like to the rail engaging devices may be secured to the vertical web members of the rail modules .

Referring now to each of the joining arrangements preferably includes a tongue plate assembly a corresponding groove plate assembly side plates and a chain wrench assembly for quickly releasing and securing opposing rail modules . In some embodiments as shown in the tongue plate assembly is attached to a first end of each rail module of the rail assembly and the corresponding groove plate assembly is attached to a second end of each rail module of the rail assembly . In other embodiments the tongue plate assemblies are attached to the first and second ends of alternating ones of the rail modules of the rail assembly and groove plate assemblies are attached to the first and second ends of the corresponding remaining rail modules of the rail assembly .

In one embodiment the tongue plate assembly and the groove plate assembly are each constructed as two separate substantially identical planar members . Each planar member includes a plurality of apertures . The planar members are attached on opposing sides of the marginal end of the vertical web member of the rail module . The apertures and of the planar members and respectively align with each other and corresponding apertures not visible provided in the marginal end of the vertical web member of the rail module when the plates are positioned thereon. A plurality of nut and bolt type fasteners extend through the tongue or groove plate planar member apertures and and corresponding web apertures provided the marginal end of the vertical web member of the rail module to attach the tongue and groove plate assembles and to the rail modules .

In the case of the tongue plate assembly the front edge surface of each planar member includes three downwardly bent tongue elements . The bend angles of the tongue elements increase successively front the uppermost tongue element to the lowermost tongue element

In the case of the groove plate assembly the front edge surface of each planar member includes three downwardly bent groove elements which are sized and shaped to correspond with and receive their respective downwardly bent tongue elements of the tongue plate . As with the tongue elements the bend angles of the groove elements increase successively from the uppermost groove element to the lowermost groove element

In an alternate embodiment of the joining arrangement as shown in the tongue and groove plate assemblies and are omitted and replaced by tongue elements and groove elements similar to those described earlier machined into or unitarily formed at leading edge surfaces of vertical webs of the rail modules . Planar side plates are preferably bolted to the vertical web of only one of the two rail modules using fasteners one side plate on each side of the web to align the modules and retain the engagement of the tongue elements with the groove elements shown with broken lines . In a less desirable embodiment the side plates may be bolted to the vertical webs of both of the two rail modules although this arrangement will slow down assembly and disassembly of the rail modules . The side plates may also be utilized with the tongue and groove plate assemblies and described earlier to align the modules and retain the engagement of the tongue and groove elements of the tongue and groove assemblies and .

The tongue and groove assemblies and and the side plates may be formed from a high strength aluminum alloy material including but not limited to 6061 T6 2014 2024 and 7075 other high strength light weight alloys and other high strength light weight materials.

Referring again to the chain wrench assembly in one embodiment includes first and second L shape upper lever wrenches and first and second L shape lower lever wrenches an upper chain removably connecting the first and second upper wrenches and and a lower chain removably connecting the first and second lower wrenches and Each L shape lever wrench includes a handle member a lever member with a chain link catch finger disposed at a free end thereof and a pivot member disposed at the junction of the handle and lever members. The pivot member of the first upper lever wrench pivotally attaches the first upper lever wrench to the vertical web member of a first rail module at a location which is adjacent to the horizontal upper flange member and a first end of the first rail module such that the lever member of the first upper lever wrench extends through a longitudinally elongated slot not shown in the horizontal upper flange member of the first rail module . The pivot member of the first lower lever wrench pivotally attaches the first lower lever wrench to the vertical web member of the first rail module at a location which is adjacent to the horizontal lower flange member and the first end of the first rail module such that the lever member of the first lower lever wrench extends through a longitudinally elongated slot not shown in the horizontal lower flange member of the first rail module . The pivot member of the second upper lever wrench pivotally attaches the second upper lever wrench to the vertical web member of a second opposing rail module at a location which is adjacent to the horizontal upper flange member and a first end of the second rail module such that the lever member of the second upper lever wrench extends through a longitudinally elongated slot not shown in the horizontal upper flange member of the second rail module . The pivot member of the second lower lever wrench pivotally attaches the second lower lever wrench to the vertical web member of the second rail module at a location which is adjacent to the horizontal lower flange member and the first end of the second rail module such that the lever member of the second lower lever wrench extends through a longitudinally elongated slot not shown in the horizontal lower flange member of the second rail module .

The downwardly bent tongue and groove elements allow for quick and easy assembly of the rail assembly from the ground plane GP as shown in . Because the lowermost tongue and groove elements and are bent downwardly at the greatest angle it allows for easy initial engagement of the second rail module to a corresponding suspended or supported first rail module . Once the lowermost tongue and groove elements and are partially engaged the second rail module may be pivoted up about pivot point P and moved toward the suspended or supported first rail module using the lowermost tongue and groove elements and as a sliding pivot point to partially engage the intermediate tongue and groove elements and and then partially engage the uppermost tongue and groove elements and . As the uppermost tongue and groove elements and are brought together into full engagement the lowermost tongue and groove elements and become fully engaged followed by full engagement of the intermediate tongue and groove elements and and finally full engagement of the upper tongue and groove elements and . The downwardly bent angles of the tongue and groove elements also resist sagging at the rail module joints better than straight angle tongue and groove elements.

After the first and second rail modules are together the upper and lower chains are connected to their corresponding lever wrenches and tensioned to compress and thereby hold the first and second rail modules together. More specifically a first end link of the upper chain may be connected to the chain link catch finger of the first upper lever wrench and a second end link of the upper chain may be connected to the chain link catch finger of the second upper lever wrench . A first end link of the lower chain may be connected to the chain link catch finger of the first lower lever wrench and a second end link of the lower chain may be connected to the chain link catch finger of the second lower lever wrench . The upper chain may be tensioned by manually grasping the handle members of the first and second upper lever wrenches and rotating them down about their pivot members . Similarly the lower chain may be tensioned by manually grasping the handle members of the first and second lower lever wrenches and rotating them up about their pivot members . A first lock rod may be removably connected to free ends of the handle members of the first upper and lower lever wrenches and a second lock rod may be removably connected to free ends of the handle members of the second upper and lower lever wrenches to prevent them from rotating and releasing the tension on the upper and lower chains .

The rail mounted transport device shown in comprises a trolley. The trolley may include first and second pairs of track rollers which carry the trolley on the lower flange horizontal riding surfaces of the rail modules . A hook may be connected to a bottom of the trolley for connecting articles e.g. cabinets and equipment that are to be transported by the trolley on the rail transport system .

The rail transport system provides a fast and efficient system for transporting articles. Since each rail module is very light via its aluminum or plastic construction the entire system may be installed and assembled as described above by a single person.

Although the invention has been described in terms of exemplary embodiments it is not limited thereto. Rather the appended claims should be construed broadly to include other variants and embodiments of the invention which may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and range of equivalents of the invention.
