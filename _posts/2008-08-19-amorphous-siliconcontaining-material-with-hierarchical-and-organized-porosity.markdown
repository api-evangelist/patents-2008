The present invention relates to the field of materials containing silicon notably metallosilicate materials and more precisely aluminosilicate materials with hierarchical porosity in the microporosity and mesoporosity domains and organized porosity in the mesoporosity domain. It also relates to the preparation of these materials that are obtained by means of the synthesis technique referred to as aerosol synthesis.

New synthesis strategies allowing to obtain materials of well defined porosity in a very wide range from microporous materials to macroporous materials to hierarchical porosity materials i.e. having pores of several sizes have known a very large development within the scientific community since the mid 90s G. J. de A. A. Soler Illia C. Sanchez B. Lebeau J. Patarin 2002 102 4093 . In particular considerable work has been done on the development of materials having a microporosity of zeolitic nature and a mesoporosity so as to simultaneously benefit from the catalytic properties specific to zeolites and from the catalytic and especially the textural properties of the mesoporous phase.

A technique that is commonly used to generate materials having such biporosity consists in directly creating mesopores within zeolite crystals by subjecting the zeolite to a steam hydrothermal treatment also referred to as steaming. Under the effect of this treatment the mobility of the tetrahedric atoms that make up the framework of the zeolite is increased to such an extent that some of these atoms are extracted from the network which causes formation of amorphous zones that can be cleared to give way to mesoporous cavities A. H. Jansen A. J. Koster K. P. de Jong J. Phys. Chem. B 2002 106 11905 . The formation of such cavities can also be obtained by subjecting the zeolite to an acid treatment H. Ajot J. F. Joly J. Lynch F. Raatz P. Caullet 1991 62 583 . These methods however have the drawback of making part of the zeolite partly amorphous and of modifying the properties thereof through variation of the chemical composition. In any case the mesoporosity thus introduced allows to eliminate or at least to limit diffusion limitation problems encountered in microporous materials mesopores having much greater diffusion factors than micropores and thus allowing access to the active sites of the zeolites P. B. Weisz 1973 3 498 .

More recently much work has been done on the elaboration of mixed mesostructured zeolite materials mesostructured materials affording the additional advantage of a perfectly organized and calibrated porosity in the mesopore range.

It can be briefly reminded here that mesostructured materials are conventionally obtained via synthesis methods referred to as soft chemistry methods that consist in bringing together in an aqueous solution or in polar solvents inorganic precursors with structuring agents generally molecular or macromolecular surfactants ionic or neutral. Control of electrostatic interactions or of interactions through hydrogen bonds between the inorganic precursors and the structuring agent jointly linked with hydrolysis condensation reactions of the inorganic precursor leads to a cooperative assembly of the organic and inorganic phases generating micellar aggregates of surfactants of uniform and controlled size within an inorganic matrix. Clearance of the porosity is then obtained by surfactant elimination which is conventionally carried out by means of chemical extraction processes or by thermal treatment. Depending on the nature of the inorganic precursors and of the structuring agent used and on the operating conditions applied several families of mesostructured materials have been developed such as the M41S family obtained using long chain quaternary ammonium salts as the structuring agent J. S. Beck J. C. Vartuli W. J. Roth M. E. Leonowicz C. T. Kresge K. D. Schmitt C. T. W. Chu D. H. Olson E. W. Sheppard S. B. McCullen J. B. Higgins J. L. Schlenker 1992 114 27 10834 or the SBA family obtained using three block copolymers as the structuring agent D. Zhao J. Feng Q. Huo N. Melosh G. H. Fredickson B. F. Chmelka G. D. Stucky 1998 279 548 .

Several synthesis techniques allowing elaboration of such mixed mesostructured zeolite materials have thus been listed in the open literature. A first synthesis technique consists in synthesizing in a first stage a mesostructured aluminosilicate material according to the conventional methods described above then in a second stage in impregnating this material with a structuring agent commonly used in the synthesis of zeolitic materials. A suitable hydrothermal treatment leads to a zeolitization of the amorphous walls of the initial mesostructured aluminosilicate K. R. Koletstra H. van Bekkum J. C. Jansen 1997 2281 D. T. On S. Kaliaguine 2001 40 3248 D. T. On D. Lutic S. Kaliaguine 2001 44 435 M. J. Verhoef P. J. Kooyman J. C. van der Waal M. S. Rigutto J. A. Peters H. van Bekkum 2001 13 683 S. Kaliaguine D. T. On U.S. Pat. No. 6 669 924B1 2003 . A second synthesis technique consists in bringing together a colloidal solution of zeolite seeds also referred to as protozeolite entities and a surfactant commonly used to create a mesostructuration of the final material. The basic idea here is to simultaneously generate the elaboration of an inorganic matrix of organized mesoporosity and the growth within this matrix of zeolite seeds so as to ideally obtain a mesostructured aluminosilicate material with crystallized walls Z. Zhang et al. 2001 123 5014 Y. Liu et al. 2000 122 8791 . A variant of these two techniques consists in starting from a mixture of aluminium and silicon precursors in the presence of two structuring agents one likely to generate a zeolitic system and the other likely to generate a mesostructuration. This solution is then subjected to two crystallization stages under variable hydrothermal treatment conditions the first stage leading to the formation of the mesoporous structure of organized porosity and the second stage leading to the zeolitization of the amorphous walls A. Karlsson M. St cker R. Schmidt 1999 27 181 L. Huang W. Guo P. Deng Z. Xue Q. Li 2000 104 2817 . All of these synthesis methods have the drawback of damaging the mesostructure and thus to lose the advantages thereof in cases where growth of the zeolite seeds or zeolitization of the walls is not perfectly controlled which makes these techniques delicate to implement.

It can be noted that it is also possible to directly elaborate composite mesostructured zeolite materials so as to take advantage of the catalytic properties specific to each one of these phases. This can be done through thermal treatment of a mixture of a zeolite seed solution and of a mesostructured aluminosilicate seed solution P. Prokesova S. Mintova J. Cejka T. Bein 2003 64 165 or through growth of a zeolite layer at the surface of a presynthesized mesostructured aluminosilicate D. T. On S. Kaliaguine 2002 41 1036 .

To the exclusion of the mesoporous zeolitic materials obtained through post treatment of a zeolite we note that from an experimental point of view all these materials are obtained by direct precipitation of inorganic precursors in the presence or not of structuring agents within an aqueous solution or in polar solvents this stage being in most cases followed by one or more ripening stages in an autoclave. The elementary particles usually obtained exhibit no regular shape and they are characterized by a size ranging between 200 and 500 nm and often well above 500 nm.

In the case of non zeolitic mesostructured materials it is possible to achieve cooperative self assembly of the structuring agent with the inorganic precursors hydrolyzed and condensed at various degrees of advancement by progressive evaporation of a solution of these reactants whose structuring agent concentration is below the critical micellar concentration c known to the person skilled in the art which leads to either the formation of mesostructured films in the case of deposition on a substrate dip coating technique or to the formation of a mesostructured powder after atomization of the solution aerosol technique . By way of example patent U.S. Pat. No. 6 387 453 discloses the formation of mesostructured organic inorganic hybrid films using the dip coating technique besides these authors have used the aerosol technique to elaborate purely silicic mesostructured materials C. J. Brinker Y. Lu A. Sellinger H. Fan 1999 11 7 .

The invention relates to a material with hierarchical porosity in the microporosity and mesoporosity domains and organized porosity in the mesoporosity domain consisting of at least two elementary spherical particles each one of said particles comprising a matrix based on silicon oxide mesostructured having a mesopore diameter ranging between 1.5 and 30 nm and exhibiting amorphous and microporous walls of thickness ranging between 1 and 50 nm said elementary spherical particles having a maximum diameter of 200 microns. Said matrix based on silicon oxide optionally also comprises at least one element X selected from among aluminium iron boron indium and gallium preferably aluminium. The present invention also relates to the preparation of the material according to the invention. The method of preparing the material according to the invention comprises a preparing a clear solution containing the protozeolite entity precursor elements i.e. at least one structuring agent at least one silicic precursor and possibly at least one precursor of at least one element X selected from among aluminium iron boron indium and gallium preferably aluminium b mixing into a solution at least one surfactant and at least said clear solution obtained in stage a such that the ratio of the volumes of inorganic and organic matter V Vranges between 0.26 and 4 c aerosol atomizing said solution obtained in stage b so as to lead to the formation of spherical droplets d drying said droplets and e eliminating said structuring agent and said surfactant so as to obtain an amorphous material with hierarchical porosity in the microporosity and mesoporosity domains and organized porosity in the mesoporosity domain.

The microporosity induced by the amorphous walls of the material according to the invention results not only from the use of a solution comprising the protozeolite entity precursor elements according to stage a of the method of the invention but also from aerosol atomizing the solution comprising at least one surfactant and a clear solution according to stage c of the method of the invention. The mesostructuration of the material according to the invention results from the phenomenon of micellization or self assembly by evaporation induced by the aerosol technique according to stage c of the method of the invention generated by the presence of the surfactant and of the inorganic phase from the solution containing the protozeolite entity precursor elements.

The material according to the invention that comprises a mesostructured inorganic matrix based on silicon oxide with microporous and amorphous walls simultaneously exhibits the textural properties specific to microporous materials and to mesostructured materials. Preferably the matrix based on silicon oxide forming each one of the elementary spherical particles of the material according to the invention comprises in addition to silicon at least one element X selected from among aluminium iron boron indium and gallium preferably aluminium so as to form an amorphous aluminosilicate matrix. The material according to the invention then exhibits when X is aluminium greater acidobasicity properties than the amorphous aluminosilicate materials of the prior art devoid of protozeolite entity precursors and prepared according to synthesis protocols known to the person skilled in the art using inorganic silica and alumina precursors. Besides the presence within the same spherical particle of micrometric or even nanometric size of mesopores organized in a microporous and amorphous inorganic matrix leads to preferential access of the reactants and of the reaction products to the microporous sites when the material according to the invention is used in potential industrial applications. Furthermore the material according to the invention consists of spherical elementary particles the diameter of these particles being maximum 200 m preferably less than 100 m advantageously ranging between 50 nm and 20 m more advantageously between 50 nm and 10 m and most advantageously between 50 nm and 3 m. The limited size of these particles and their homogeneous spherical size provides better diffusion of the reactants and of the reaction products when the material according to the invention is used in potential industrial applications by comparison with materials known from the prior art that come in form of elementary particles of non homogeneous shape i.e. irregular and of size often well above 500 nm.

The object of the present invention is a material with hierarchical porosity consisting of at least two elementary spherical particles each one of said particles comprising a matrix based on silicon oxide mesostructured having a mesopore diameter ranging between 1.5 and 30 nm and exhibiting amorphous and microporous walls of thickness ranging between 1.5 and 50 nm said elementary spherical particles having a maximum diameter of 200 microns.

The material according to the invention is a material with hierarchical porosity in the microporosity and mesoporosity domains and organized porosity in the mesoporosity domain. What is understood to be a material with hierarchical and organized porosity in the sense of the present invention is a material having a double porosity on the scale of each one of said spherical particle a mesoporosity i.e. the presence of pores organized on the mesoporous scale having a uniform diameter ranging between 1.5 and 30 nm preferably between 1.5 and 15 nm homogeneously and evenly distributed in each one of said particles mesostructuration and a microporosity induced by the amorphous walls the characteristics of this microporosity depending on the constituent protozeolite entities of the amorphous walls of the matrix of each spherical particle of the material according to the invention. The microporosity is characterized by the presence of micropores within said amorphous walls of diameter below 1.5 nm. The material according to the invention also exhibits an intraparticular textural macroporosity. It can be noted that a porosity of microporous nature can also result from the imbrication of the surfactant used to prepare the material according to the invention with the inorganic wall at the level of the organic inorganic interface developed upon mesostructuration of the inorganic component of said material according to the invention. Advantageously none of the spherical particles making up the material according to the invention has macropores.

In accordance with the invention the matrix based on silicon oxide forming each of the spherical particles of the material according to the invention has amorphous walls exclusively consisting of protozeolite entities that are at the origin of the microporosity present within each spherical particle of the material according to the invention. Protozeolite entities are species prepared from reactants used for the synthesis of zeolites and the preparation of said species has not been brought to the crystallized zeolite formation stage. Said small size protozeolite entities are therefore not detected when characterized by wide angle X ray diffraction. More precisely and in accordance with the invention the protozeolite entities that fully and homogeneously make up the amorphous microporous walls of the matrix of each spherical particle of the material according to the invention are species resulting from bringing together at least one structuring agent at least one silicic precursor and optionally at least one precursor of at least one element X selected from among aluminium iron boron indium and gallium preferably aluminium under variable time and temperature conditions allowing to obtain a clear solution and said species can serve as a primer for the synthesis of any zeolite known to the person skilled in the art and in particular but in a non exhaustive manner the synthesis of the zeolites listed in 5revised Edition 2001 C. Baerlocher W. M. Meier D. H. Olson.

The protozeolite entities that fully make up the amorphous walls of the matrix of each particle of the material according to the invention and at the origin of the microporosity thereof preferably are species for priming at least one zeolite selected from among the following zeolites ZSM 5 ZSM 48 ZSM 22 ZSM 23 ZBM 30 EU 2 EU 11 Silicalite Beta zeolite A Faujasite Y USY VUSY SDUSY mordenite NU 87 NU 88 NU 86 NU 85 IM 5 IM 12 Ferrierite and EU 1. More preferably the protozeolite entities that fully make up the amorphous and microporous walls of the matrix of each particle of the material according to the invention are species for priming at least one zeolite selected from among the zeolites of MFI BEA FAU and LTA structural type.

In accordance with the invention the matrix based on silicon oxide forming each of the elementary spherical particles of the material according to the invention is either entirely silicic or it comprises in addition to silicon at least one element X selected from among aluminium iron boron indium and gallium preferably aluminium. Thus the protozeolite entities that fully make up the amorphous and microporous walls of the matrix of each particle of the material according to the invention and at the origin of the microporosity thereof advantageously are species for priming at least one zeolite either entirely silicic or containing in addition to silicon at least one element X selected from among aluminium iron boron indium and gallium preferably aluminium. When X is aluminium the matrix of the material is in this case an amorphous aluminosilicate precursor of a crystallized aluminosilicate material. This amorphous aluminosilicate has a Si Al molar ratio identical to that of the solution of the silicic and aluminic precursors leading to the formation of the protozeolite entities that fully make up the amorphous and microporous walls of the matrix.

The matrix based on silicon oxide contained in each spherical particle making up the material according to the invention is mesostructured it exhibits mesopores of uniform diameter i.e. identical for each mesopore ranging between 1.5 and 30 nm preferably between 1.5 and 15 nm homogeneously and evenly distributed in each spherical particle. The matter located between the mesopores of each one of said spherical particles is microporous and fully amorphous and it forms walls whose thickness ranges between 1 and 50 nm preferably between 1 and 30 nm. The thickness of the walls corresponds to the distance between a first mesopore and a second mesopore the second mesopore being the pore that is the closest to said first mesopore. The mesoporosity organization described above leads to a structuration of the matrix based on silicon oxide that can be hexagonal vermicular or cubic preferably vermicular.

The mesostructuration of the material according to the invention can be of vermicular cubic or hexagonal type depending on the nature of the surfactant used for the material according to the invention.

In accordance with the invention said elementary spherical particles making up the material according to the invention have a maximum diameter of 200 microns preferably less than 100 microns advantageously ranging between 50 nm and 20 m more advantageously ranging between 50 nm and 10 m and most advantageously ranging between 50 and 3 m. More precisely they are present in the material according to the invention in form of aggregates.

The material according to the invention advantageously has a specific surface area ranging between 100 and 1100 m g more advantageously between 200 and 1000 m g.

The material according to the invention advantageously has a mesopore volume measured by nitrogen volumetric analysis ranging between 0.01 and 1 ml g and a micropore volume measured by nitrogen volumetric analysis ranging between 0.01 and 0.4 ml g.

The object of the present invention also is the preparation of the material according to the invention. Said method of preparing the material according to the invention comprises a preparing a clear solution containing the protozeolite entity precursor elements i.e. at least one structuring agent at least one silicic precursor and possibly at least one precursor of at least one element X selected from among aluminium iron boron indium and gallium preferably aluminium b mixing into a solution at least one surfactant and at least said clear solution obtained in stage a such that the ratio of the volumes of inorganic and organic matter ranges between 0.26 and 4 c aerosol atomizing said solution obtained in stage b so as to lead to the formation of spherical droplets d drying said droplets and e eliminating said structuring agent and said surfactant so as to obtain an amorphous material with hierarchical porosity in the microporosity and mesoporosity domains and organized porosity in the mesoporosity domain.

The silicic precursor used for carrying out stage a of the method according to the invention is selected from among the silicon oxide precursors known to the person skilled in the art. In particular a silicic precursor selected from among the silica precursors commonly used in the synthesis of zeolites is advantageously used for example powdered solid silica silicic acid colloidal silica dissolved silica or tetraethoxysilane also referred to as tetraethylorthosilicate TEOS . The silicic precursor preferably is TEOS.

The precursor of element X optionally used for carrying out stage a of the method according to the invention can be any compound comprising element X and that can release this element in solution notably in aqueous or aquo organic solution in reactive form. In the preferred case where X is aluminium the aluminic precursor advantageously is an inorganic aluminium salt of formula AlZ Z being a halogen a nitrate or a hydroxide. Preferably Z is chlorine.

The aluminic precursor can also be sodium or ammonium aluminate or alumina proper in one of its crystalline phases known to the person skilled in the art alpha delta teta gamma preferably in hydrated form or in a form that can be hydrated.

It is also possible to use mixtures of the aforementioned precursors. Some or all of the aluminic and silicic precursors can optionally be added in form of a single compound comprising both aluminium atoms and silicon atoms an amorphous silica alumina for example.

The structuring agent used for carrying out stage a of the method according to the invention can be ionic or neutral depending on the nature of the zeolite that would be obtained from said protozeolite entities. The structuring agents from the following non exhaustive list are frequently used nitrogen containing organic cations such as tetrapropylammonium TPA elements from the alkaline family Cs K Na etc. crown ethers diamines as well as any other structuring agent known to the person skilled in the art for zeolite synthesis.

The clear solution containing the protozeolite entity precursor elements according to stage a of the material preparation method of the invention is generally obtained by preparing a reaction mixture containing at least one silicic precursor optionally at least one precursor of at least one element X selected from among aluminium iron boron indium and gallium preferably at least one aluminic precursor and at least one structuring agent. The reaction mixture is either aqueous or aquo organic a water alcohol mixture for example. A basic reaction medium is preferably used throughout the various stages of the method according to the invention in order to favour the development of the protozeolite entities making up the amorphous and microporous walls of the matrix of each particle of the material according to the invention. The basicity of the solution is advantageously provided by the basicity of the structuring agent used or by basification of the reaction mixture through addition of a basic compound for example an alkaline metal hydroxide preferably sodium hydroxide. The reaction mixture can be subjected to hydrothermal conditions under autogenous pressure optionally by adding a gas nitrogen for example at a temperature ranging between ambient temperature and 200 C. preferably between ambient temperature and 170 C. more preferably at a temperature that does not exceed 120 C. until formation of a clear solution containing the precursor elements of the protozeolite entities that make up the amorphous and microporous walls of the matrix of each spherical particle of the material according to the invention. According to a preferred method of operation the reaction mixture containing at least one structuring agent at least one silicic precursor and optionally at least one precursor of at least one element X selected from among aluminium iron boron indium and gallium is ripened at ambient temperature so as to obtain a clear solution containing the precursor elements of protozeolite entities likely to generate the formation of crystallized zeolite entities.

In accordance with stage a of the method according to the invention the precursor elements of the protozeolite entities present in the clear solution are synthesized according to operating protocols known to the person skilled in the art. In particular for a material according to the invention the matrix of each particle of which consists of beta protozeolite entities a clear solution containing precursor elements of beta protozeolite entities is prepared according to the operating protocol described by P. Prokesova S. Mintova J. Cejka T. Bein et al. 2003 64 165.

In the particular case of a purely silicic material the clear solution containing the precursor elements of silicalite protozeolite entities making up the walls of said material of the invention is advantageously prepared according to the operating protocol described by A. E. Persson B. J. Schoeman J. Sterte J. E. Otterstedt 1994 14 557.

In accordance with stage b of the material preparation method according to the invention the surfactant used is an ionic or a non ionic surfactant or a mixture thereof. Preferably the ionic surfactant is selected from among anionic surfactants such as sulfates like for example sodium dodecylsulfate SDS . Preferably the non ionic surfactant can be any copolymer having at least two parts of different polarities conferring amphiphilic macromolecule properties on them. These copolymers can comprise at least one block belonging to the non exhaustive list of the following polymer families fluorinated polymers CH CH CH CH O CO R1 with R1 CF CF etc. biological polymers such as polyamino acids poly lysine alginates etc. dendrimers polymers consisting of poly alkylene oxide chains. Any other copolymer of amphiphilic character known to the person skilled in the art can be used if it allows to obtain a stable solution in stage b of the preparation method according to the invention such as poly styrene b acrylamide for example S. F rster M. Antionnetti 1998 10 195 217 S. F rster T. Plantenberg 2002 41 688 714 H. C lfen 2001 22 219 252 . Preferably a block copolymer consisting of poly alkylene oxide chains is used within the scope of the present invention. Said block copolymer is preferably a block copolymer having two three or four blocks each block consisting of a poly alkylene oxide chain. For a two block copolymer one of the block consists of a poly alkylene oxide chain of hydrophilic nature and the other block consists of a poly alkylene oxide chain of hydrophobic nature. For a three block copolymer at least one of the blocks consists of a poly alkylene oxide chain of hydrophilic nature whereas at least one of the other blocks consists of a poly alkylene oxide chain of hydrophobic nature. Preferably in the case of a three block copolymer the poly alkylene oxide chains of hydrophilic nature are poly ethylene oxide chains denoted by PEO and PEO and the poly alkylene oxide chains of hydrophobic nature are poly propylene oxide chains denoted by PPO poly butylene oxide chains or mixed chains each chain of which is a mixture of several alkylene oxide monomers.

More precisely a compound of formula PEO PPO PEO where x ranges between 5 and 300 y ranges between 33 and 300 and z ranges between 5 and 300 is used. Preferably the values of x and z are identical. A compound wherein x 20 y 70 and z 20 P123 and a compound wherein x 106 y 70 and z 106 F127 are very advantageously used. The commercial non ionic surfactants known as Pluronic BASF Tetronic BASF Triton Sigma Tergitol Union Carbide and Brij Aldrich can be used as non ionic surfactants in stage b of the preparation method according to the invention. For a four block copolymer two of the blocks consist of a poly alkylene oxide chain of hydrophilic nature and the other two blocks consist of a poly alkylene oxide chain of hydrophobic nature.

The solution obtained at the end of stage b of the preparation method according to the invention wherein at least said surfactant and at least said clear solution obtained in stage a are mixed can be acid neutral or basic. Preferably said solution is basic and it preferably has a pH value above 9 this pH value being generally imposed by the pH value of the clear solution containing the precursor elements of protozeolite entities obtained according to stage a of the material preparation method of the invention. The solution obtained at the end of stage b can be aqueous or it can be a mixture of water and organic solvent the organic solvent preferably being a polar solvent notably an alcohol preferably ethanol.

The amount of organic compounds i.e. of surfactant and of structuring agent present in the mixture in accordance with stage b of the preparation method according to the invention is defined in relation to the amount of inorganic matter present in said mixture after adding the clear solution containing the precursor elements of protozeolite entities according to stage a of the method of the invention. The amount of inorganic matter corresponds to the amount of matter of the silicic precursor and of the precursor of element X when it is present. The V Vvolume ratio is such that the organic inorganic binary system formed in atomization stage c of the preparation method according to the invention undergoes a mesostructuration process through self assembly of the surfactant jointly with the hydrolysis condensation reactions of the various inorganic precursors. Said V Vvolume ratio is defined as follows V V m m with mthe final mass of the inorganic fraction in form of condensed oxide s in the solid elementary particle obtained by atomization mthe total mass of the non volatile organic fraction found in the solid elementary particle obtained by atomization and the densities respectively associated with the non volatile organic and inorganic fractions. Within the scope of the invention when element X is aluminium and for calculation simplification approximations valid for a large majority of non volatile organic fraction and for an inorganic fraction of aluminosilicate network type we consider that 1 and 2. Within the scope of the invention mgenerally corresponds to the mass of SiOto which the mass of AlOis added when X is aluminium and mcorresponds to the mass of the structuring agent TPAOH for example to which the mass of the surfactant surfactant F127 for example is added. The polar solvent preferably ethanol as well as water and soda are not taken into account in the calculation of said ratio V V. The species comprising an element X preferably the aluminic species optionally introduced for the preparation of the material according to the invention after carrying out said stage b are not taken into account for the calculation of ratio V Vdefined above. In accordance with the invention the amount of organic matter and the amount of inorganic matter in the mixture obtained after carrying out stage b is such that ratio V Vranges between 0.26 and 4 preferably between 0.30 and 2. In accordance with stage b of the method according to the invention the initial concentration of the surfactant introduced in the mixture defined by c is such that cis less than or equal to c parameter crepresenting the critical micellar concentration known to the person skilled in the art i.e. the limit concentration beyond which the phenomenon of self assembly of the surfactant molecules occurs in the solution obtained after stage b . Prior to atomization the surfactant molecule concentration of the solution obtained after stage b of the preparation method according to the invention does therefore not lead to the formation of particular micellar phases. In a preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention concentration cis less than c ratio V Vis such that the composition of the binary system verifies the composition conditions for which a mesostructuration mechanism takes place through cooperative self assembly of the reactants V Vranging between 0.26 and 4 preferably between 0.3 and 2 and said solution sought in stage b of the preparation method according to the invention is a basic water alcohol mixture.

The mixture atomization stage according to stage c of the preparation method according to the invention produces spherical droplets. The size distribution of these droplets is of lognormal type. The aerosol generator used here is a commercial device of 9306 A type provided by TSI having a 6 jet atomizer. Atomization of the solution occurs in a chamber into which a carrier gas a O Nmixture dry air is sent at a pressure P of 1.5 bar.

In accordance with stage d of the preparation method according to the invention said droplets are dried. Drying is carried out through the transportation of said droplets via the carrier gas the O Nmixture in PVC tubes which leads to the progressive evaporation of the solution for example the basic aquo organic solution obtained in stage b of the preparation method according to the invention and thus to the formation of spherical elementary particles. This drying procedure is completed by passage of said particles through an oven whose temperature can be adjusted the usual temperature ranging between 50 C. and 600 C. preferably between 80 C. and 400 C. the residence time of the particles in the oven being of the order of one second. The particles are then recovered on a filter. A pump arranged at the end of the circuit favours delivery of the species in the aerosol experimental device.
