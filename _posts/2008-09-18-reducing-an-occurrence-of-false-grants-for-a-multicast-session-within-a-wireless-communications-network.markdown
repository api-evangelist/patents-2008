abstract: Aspects of reducing an occurrence of false grants for a multicast session within a wireless communications network are disclosed. For example, an access network receives an announce message to be transmitted to a plurality of access terminals, the received announce message configured to announce a given multicast session. The access network determines whether sufficient resources are available to support the given multicast session, The access network configures the received announce message to convey whether sufficient resources are available to support the given multicast session based on the determining step, and transmits the configured announce message to the plurality of access terminals. A given access terminal receives the announce message, and determines whether the received announce message indicates whether sufficient resources are available to support the given multicast session. The given access terminal sends an announce acknowledgment (ACK) message that indicates an acceptance or rejection of the given multicast session.

The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Application No. 60 974 805 entitled METHODS OF REDUCING AN OCCURRENCE OF FALSE GRANTS FOR A MULTICAST SESSION WITHIN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK filed Sep. 24 2007 which is assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

The invention relates to communications in a wireless telecommunication system and more particularly to methods of reducing an occurrence of false grants for a multicast session within a wireless communications network.

Wireless communication systems have developed through various generations including a first generation analog wireless phone service 1G a second generation 2G digital wireless phone service including interim 2.5G and 2.75G networks and a third generation 3G high speed data Internet capable wireless service. There are presently many different types of wireless communication systems in use including Cellular and Personal Communications Service PCS systems. Examples of known cellular systems include the cellular Analog Advanced Mobile Phone System AMPS and digital cellular systems based on Code Division Multiple Access CDMA Frequency Division Multiple Access FDMA Time Division Multiple Access TDMA the Global System for Mobile access GSM variation of TDMA and newer hybrid digital communication systems using both TDMA and CDMA technologies.

The method for providing CDMA mobile communications was standardized in the United States by the Telecommunications Industry Association Electronic Industries Association in TIA EIA IS 95 A entitled Mobile Station Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System referred to herein as IS 95. Combined AMPS CDMA systems are described in TIA EIA Standard IS 98. Other communications systems are described in the IMT 2000 UM or International Mobile Telecommunications System 2000 Universal Mobile Telecommunications System standards covering what are referred to as wideband CDMA WCDMA CDMA2000 such as CDMA2000 1xEV DO standards for example or TD SCDMA.

In wireless communication systems mobile stations handsets or access terminals AT receive signals from fixed position base stations also referred to as cell sites or cells that support communication links or service within particular geographic regions adjacent to or surrounding the base stations. Base stations provide entry points to an access network AN radio access network RAN which is generally a packet data network using standard Internet Engineering Task Force IETF based protocols that support methods for differentiating traffic based on Quality of Service QoS requirements. Therefore the base stations generally interact with ATs through an over the air interface and with the AN through Internet Protocol IP network data packets.

In wireless telecommunication systems Push to talk PTT capabilities are becoming popular with service sectors and consumers. PTT can support a dispatch voice service that operates over standard commercial wireless infrastructures such as CDMA FDMA TDMA GSM etc. In a dispatch model communication between endpoints ATs occurs within virtual groups wherein the voice of one talker is transmitted to one or more listeners. A single instance of this type of communication is commonly referred to as a dispatch call or simply a PTT call. A PTT call is an instantiation of a group which defines the characteristics of a call. A group in essence is defined by a member list and associated information such as group name or group identification.

Conventionally data packets within a wireless communication network have been configured to be sent to a single destination or access terminal. A transmission of data to a single destination is referred to as unicast . As mobile communications have increased the ability to transmit given data concurrently to multiple access terminals has become more important. Accordingly protocols have been adopted to support concurrent data transmissions of the same packet or message to multiple destinations or target access terminals. A broadcast refers to a transmission of data packets to all destinations or access terminals e.g. within a given cell served by a given service provider etc. while a multicast refers to a transmission of data packets to a given group of destinations or access terminals. In an example the given group of destinations or multicast group may include more than one and less than all of possible destinations or access terminals e.g. within a given group served by a given service provider etc. . However it is at least possible in certain situations that the multicast group comprises only one access terminal similar to a unicast or alternatively that the multicast group comprises all access terminals e.g. within a cell or sector similar to a broadcast.

Broadcasts and or multicasts may be performed within wireless communication systems in a number of ways such as performing a plurality of sequential unicast operations to accommodate the multicast group allocating a unique broadcast multicast channel BCH for handling multiple data transmissions at the same time and the like. A conventional system using a broadcast channel for push to talk communications is described in United States Patent Application Publication No. 2007 0049314 dated Mar. 1 2007 and entitled Push To Talk Group Call System Using CDMA 1x EVDO Cellular Network the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As described in Publication No. 2007 0049314 a broadcast channel can be used for push to talk calls using conventional signaling techniques. Although the use of a broadcast channel may improve bandwidth requirements over conventional unicast techniques the conventional signaling of the broadcast channel can still result in additional overhead and or delay and may degrade system performance.

The 3Generation Partnership Project 2 3GPP2 defines a broadcast multicast service BCMCS specification for supporting multicast communications in CDMA2000 networks. Accordingly a version of 3GPP2 s BCMCS specification entitled CDMA2000 High Rate Broadcast Multicast Packet Data Air Interface Specification dated Feb. 14 2006 Version 1.0 C.S0054 A is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Embodiments of the invention are directed to systems and methods of reducing an occurrence of false grants for a multicast session within a wireless communications network. For example an access network receives an announce message to be transmitted to a plurality of access terminals the received announce message configured to announce a given multicast session. The access network determines whether sufficient resources are available to support the given multicast session. The access network configures the received announce message to convey whether sufficient resources are available to support the given multicast session based on the determining step and transmits the configured announce message to the plurality of access terminals. A given access terminal receives the announce message and determines whether the received announce message indicates whether sufficient resources are available to support the given multicast session. The given access terminal sends an announce acknowledgment ACK message that indicates an acceptance or rejection of the given multicast session in response to the received announce message based on the determining step.

Aspects of the invention are disclosed in the following description and related drawings directed to specific embodiments of the invention. Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. Additionally well known elements of the invention will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the invention.

The words exemplary and or example are used herein to mean serving as an example instance or illustration. Any embodiment described herein as exemplary and or example is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Likewise the term embodiments of the invention does not require that all embodiments of the invention include the discussed feature advantage or mode of operation.

Further many embodiments are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by for example elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits e.g. application specific integrated circuits ASICs by program instructions being executed by one or more processors or by a combination of both. Additionally these sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein. Thus the various aspects of the invention may be embodied in a number of different forms all of which have been contemplated to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. In addition for each of the embodiments described herein the corresponding form of any such embodiments may be described herein as for example logic configured to perform the described action.

A High Data Rate HDR subscriber station referred to herein as an access terminal AT may be mobile or stationary and may communicate with one or more HDR base stations referred to herein as modem pool transceivers MPTs or base stations BS . An access terminal transmits and receives data packets through one or more modem pool transceivers to an HDR base station controller referred to as a modem pool controller MPC base station controller BSC and or packet control function PCF . Modem pool transceivers and modem pool controllers are parts of a network called an access network. An access network transports data packets between multiple access terminals.

The access network may be further connected to additional networks outside the access network such as a corporate intranet or the Internet and may transport data packets between each access terminal and such outside networks. An access terminal that has established an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is called an active access terminal and is said to be in a traffic state. An access terminal that is in the process of establishing an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is said to be in a connection setup state. An access terminal may be any data device that communicates through a wireless channel or through a wired channel for example using fiber optic or coaxial cables. An access terminal may further be any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC card compact flash external or internal modem or wireless or wireline phone. The communication link through which the access terminal sends signals to the modem pool transceiver is called a reverse link or traffic channel. The communication link through which a modem pool transceiver sends signals to an access terminal is called a forward link or traffic channel. As used herein the term traffic channel can refer to either a forward or reverse traffic channel.

Referring back to the components of the wireless network and interrelation of the elements of the exemplary embodiments of the invention are not limited to the configuration illustrated. System is merely exemplary and can include any system that allows remote access terminals such as wireless client computing devices to communicate over the air between and among each other and or between and among components connected via the air interface and RAN including without limitation carrier network the Internet and or other remote servers.

The RAN controls messages typically sent as data packets sent to a base station controller packet control function BSC PCF . The BSC PCF is responsible for signaling establishing and tearing down bearer channels i.e. data channels between a packet data service node PDSN and the access terminals . If link layer encryption is enabled the BSC PCF also encrypts the content before forwarding it over the air interface . The function of the BSC PCF is well known in the art and will not be discussed further for the sake of brevity. The carrier network may communicate with the BSC PCF by a network the Internet and or a public switched telephone network PSTN . Alternatively the BSC PCF may connect directly to the Internet or external network. Typically the network or Internet connection between the carrier network and the BSC PCF transfers data and the PSTN transfers voice information. The BSC PCF can be connected to multiple base stations BS or modem pool transceivers MPT . In a similar manner to the carrier network the BSC PCF is typically connected to the MPT BS by a network the Internet and or PSTN for data transfer and or voice information. The MPT BS can broadcast data messages wirelessly to the access terminals such as cellular telephone . The MPT BS BSC PCF and other components may form the RAN as is known in the art. However alternate configurations may also be used and the invention is not limited to the configuration illustrated. For example in another embodiment the functionality of the BSC PCF and one or more of the MPT BS may be collapsed into a single hybrid module having the functionality of both the BSC PCF and the MPT BS .

Referring to the broadcast serving node BSN may be configured to support multicast and broadcast services. The BSN will be described in greater detail below. The BSN communicates with the RAN e.g. the BSC PCF via a broadcast BC A10 connection and with the application server via the Internet . The BCA10 connection is used to transfer multicast and or broadcast messaging. Accordingly the application server sends unicast messaging to the PDSN via the Internet and sends multicast messaging to the BSN via the Internet .

Generally as will be described in greater detail below the RAN transmits multicast messages received from the BSN via the BCA10 connection over a broadcast channel BCH of the air interface to one or more access terminals .

Referring to an access terminal here a wireless device such as a cellular telephone has a platform that can receive and execute software applications data and or commands transmitted from the RAN that may ultimately come from the carrier network the Internet and or other remote servers and networks. The platform can include a transceiver operably coupled to an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or other processor microprocessor logic circuit or other data processing device. The ASIC or other processor executes the application programming interface API layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory of the wireless device. The memory can be comprised of read only or random access memory RAM and ROM EEPROM flash cards or any memory common to computer platforms. The platform also can include a local database that can hold applications not actively used in memory . The local database is typically a flash memory cell but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art such as magnetic media EEPROM optical media tape soft or hard disk or the like. The internal platform components can also be operably coupled to external devices such as antenna display push to talk button and keypad among other components as is known in the art.

Accordingly an embodiment of the invention can include an access terminal including the ability to perform the functions described herein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements software modules executed on a processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example ASIC memory API and local database may all be used cooperatively to load store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively the functionality could be incorporated into one discrete component. Therefore the features of the access terminal in are to be considered merely illustrative and the invention is not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.

The wireless communication between the access terminal and the RAN can be based on different technologies such as code division multiple access CDMA WCDMA time division multiple access TDMA frequency division multiple access FDMA Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing OFDM the Global System for Mobile Communications GSM or other protocols that may be used in a wireless communications network or a data communications network. The data communication is typically between the client device MPT BS and BSC PCF . The BSC PCF can be connected to multiple data networks such as the carrier network PSTN the Internet a virtual private network and the like thus allowing the access terminal access to a broader communication network. As discussed in the foregoing and known in the art voice transmission and or data can be transmitted to the access terminals from the RAN using a variety of networks and configurations. Accordingly the illustrations provided herein are not intended to limit the embodiments of the invention and are merely to aid in the description of aspects of embodiments of the invention.

In one of a plurality of access terminals AT 1 in communication with the RAN PTT initiator requests to initiate a PTT session or multicast session. Accordingly the PTT initiator sends a PTT call request to the application server e.g. a PTT server . Next in the application server forwards an announce message to the RAN and the RAN transmits the announce message announcing the PTT session to each multicast group member for the PTT session. For example the application server forwards the announce message to the RAN via the PDSN and or BSN and the RAN transmits the announce message over the air interface to a plurality of ATs 1 . . . N . The announce message is transmitted in multiple sectors within the wireless communication system . ATs 1 . . . N may each be present within the same sector or alternatively may be present within different sectors of the wireless communications system . Furthermore the RAN communicating with AT 1 and the RAN communicating with ATs 2 . . . N may be different.

In a given AT AT 2 among ATs 2 . . . N responds to the announce message by sending an announce acknowledgment ACK message on a reverse link access channel to the RAN . The announce ACK message may indicate either of an acceptance i.e. indicating AT 2 is interested in the announced PTT session or a rejection i.e. indicating AT 2 is not interested in the announced PTT session of the announced PTT session. For convenience of description assume that the first responder AT 2 is interested in the announced PTT session and sends an announce ACK message indicating an acceptance to the RAN in .

In the RAN forwards the announce ACK message to the application or PTT server . While not shown explicitly within the announce ACK message is sent along with a BCMCSFlowRegistration message to register for the BCMCS flow associated with the announce message. The RAN receives the BCMCSFlowRegistration message and adds AT A to a multicast group for the announced PTT session not shown .

In once the application server receives a first announce ACK message indicating an acceptance of the announced PTT session i.e. the announce ACK message sent in the application server sends the PTT initiator AT 1 a message granting AT 1 the floor. After AT 1 is granted the floor the user of AT 1 can begin sending data e.g. speaking video streaming text messaging etc. to one or more multicast group members that have registered for or are otherwise monitoring the announced PTT session. The multicast data i.e. the spoken words or other audio video from are received at the application server and are forwarded to the RAN for transmission on a downlink broadcast channel BCH within sectors containing or in proximity to sectors known expected to contain one or more interested multicast group members.

In before allocating resources on the downlink BCH for multicast message transmission associated with the announced PTT session the RAN determines whether sufficient resources are actually available for allocation. In an example this determination may be performed on a sector by sector basis.

In an example assume that AT 2 is present within sector X and sector X e.g. and its adjacent sectors do not have sufficient downlink BCH resources to handle the announced PTT session. Accordingly the RAN determines that sufficient BCH resources are not available and drops the forwarded multicast messages .

As will be appreciated from the above description of the process of the granting of the floor to the PTT initiator AT 1 when the PTT session cannot actually be handled by the RAN referred to as a false grant wastes system resources and can also cause frustrate the user of AT 1 because the user begins sending data e.g. speaking subsequent to being granted the floor only to later be informed that no one was actually listening .

As discussed above falsely granting a PTT initiator the floor when the RAN cannot support the PTT session can waste system resources and cause an unsatisfactory user experience. Accordingly embodiments of the present invention are directed to reducing the occurrence of false grants.

In the RAN determines whether sufficient BCH resources are available to support the PTT session within each sector of the wireless communication system . As will be appreciated the level of load on the downlink BCH can vary from sector to sector because each sector can be carrying different multicast sessions at different times e.g. based on where interested multicast group members are located . For example the RAN may compare the current load on the downlink BCH within each sector with a threshold load value. If the current load is greater than the threshold load value the RAN determines sufficient BCH resources to be unavailable for that sector. Otherwise if the current load is not greater than the threshold load value the RAN determines sufficient BCH resources to be available for that sector.

While not shown explicitly within implicit within the determining of step is a recognition at the RAN that the announce message forwarded in is associated with the downlink BCH. Conventionally this association is not known at the RAN which simply acts as a conduit for transmission of the announce message from the application server to the ATs 1 . . . N. In other words the announce message is an application layer message and the RAN conventionally does not analyze the content of messaging transferred via the RAN at the application level. However in the process of the RAN is configured to perform the determining of responsive to announce messages for PTT or multicast sessions and as such includes functionality to recognize announce messages.

For convenience of description assume that the RAN determines at that sufficient BCH resources are unavailable for at least one sector. In the RAN configures the announce message to include an indication for target ATs within the at least one sector that sufficient BCH resources are not available to support the PTT session in that sector s . It will be appreciated that the announce message is not simply dropped after the RAN determines the PTT session cannot be supported in one or more sectors because the application server would interpret the drop as unintentional i.e. the application server would have no way of knowing that the RAN determined to drop the announce message and may resend the announce message again and again until one or more announce ACKs are received at the application server .

The configuring of may be performed in a number of ways which will now be described in greater detail with respect to a number of illustrative examples.

In a first example the RAN can transmit the announce message including and or along with an access control message ACM . As used herein if an announce message is sent along with an ACM the combination of the announce message and ACM may collectively be referred to as the announce message in an example. The ACM controls how ATs receiving the announce message and interested in registering for the announced PTT session can access the reverse link channel in order to respond register for the announced PTT session. ACMs are discussed in greater detail within U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60 974 796 entitled METHODS OF RESPONDING TO AN INTERACTIVE MULTICAST MESSAGE WITHIN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM filed on Sep. 24 2007 assigned to the assignee hereof and expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

As discussed in the above incorporated co pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application ACMs can include i a listing of UATIs for designating an order in which the listed access terminals can access the reverse link traffic channel to respond to the announce message ii an APersistence value or a number from which each access terminal can calculate an APersistence value for a probabilistic response procedure or iii both i and ii .

Accordingly if the ACM is configured to include both i the listing of UATIs and ii the APersistence value the format of ACM can be as follows 

In an embodiment of the present invention the ACM can be expanded so as to include a Resource Availability RA field within the ACM. In an example the RA field is a single bit field that indicates whether the announced PTT session can be supported by the RAN within a particular sector. Thus for example if the RA field is set to a first logic level e.g. a higher logic level or logic 1 the RA field indicates that sufficient BCH resources are available to support the PTT session in that sector. Otherwise if the RA field is set to a second logic level e.g. a lower logic level or logic 0 the RA field indicates that sufficient resources are not available to support the PTT session in that sector. Table 2 below illustrates an ACM configured to include i the listing of UATIs ii the APersistence value and the RA field 

Thus in this example as shown in Table 2 in ACM Example 3 the RAN determines that sufficient BCH resources are not available to support the PTT session in and the configuring of sets the RA field to the second logic level RA 0 so as to indicate the BCH resource status to ATs 1 . . . N. It will be appreciated that using the RA field of the ACM to indicate the BCH resource status need not be used in conjunction with a multicast DOS message embodiment but rather can be appended or included along with any announce message format.

In a second example assume the RAN packages the announce message received from the application server into a data over signaling DOS message upon receiving the announce message in . DOS messages are well known in the art within EV DO protocols. DOS messages are defined by EV DO standards as a unicast message addressed to a unicast access terminal identifier UATI that identifies a single intended access terminal recipient and are not associated with multicast messaging in the EV DO standard. However the announce message can be addressed to the multicast access terminal identifier MATI and can be transmitted on a downlink control channel to ATs 1 . . . N with ATs 1 . . . N each being configured to recognize that a DOS message addressed to the MATI or a multicast DOS message is intended to be interpreted as a multicast message i.e. an announce message . The conversion of an announce message into a multicast DOS message is discussed in greater detail in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60 974 833 entitled MULTICAST MESSAGING WITHIN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM filed on Sep. 24 2007 assigned to the assignee hereof and expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

Conventional unicast DOS messages or DOS messages addressed to the UATI with a singled intended AT recipient include a 1 bit Acknowledgment Required ACK REQ field. Thus if the ACK REQ field is set to a first logic level e.g. a higher logic level or logic 1 a given AT is prompted to transmit an acknowledgment to the unicast DOS message and if the ACK REQ field is set to a second logic level e.g. a lower logic level or logic 0 the given AT is not prompted to transmit the acknowledgment. Within the context of multicast DOS messages acknowledgment messages are not logical in the sense that the number of AT recipients of the multicast DOS message can be relatively high and acknowledgments sent by ATs in response to a multicast DOS message would interfere with each other and clog the reverse link channel.

Accordingly because an ACK REQ 1 condition is not likely to actually be used to trigger acknowledgments responsive to multicast DOS messages a system designer can configure each of ATs 1 . . . N to interpret a multicast DOS message having an ACK REQ field set to the first logic level i.e. ACK REQ 1 as an indicator that BCH resources for the PTT session announced by the multicast DOS message are unavailable. Thus in this example if the RAN determines that sufficient BCH resources are not available to support the PTT session in the configuring of may set the ACK REQ field to the first logic level so as to indicate the BCH resource status to ATs 1 . . . N.

In a third example the RAN can transmit the announce message including and or along with a BRM if the BCH resources are not available. In this example if the announce message is not sent included within and or along with a BRM ATs interpret the announce message as indicating that sufficient BCH resources are available to handle the announced PTT session. As used herein if an announce message is sent along with an BRM the combination of the announce message and BRM may collectively be referred to as the announce message in an example.

Returning to after configuring the announce message in the RAN transmits the configured announce message e.g. including an ACM having an RA field set to a given logic level packaged as a multicast DOS message etc. in within sectors that have been determined not to have sufficient BCH resources to announce the PTT session to each of ATs 1 . . . N. While not illustrated in a conventional announce message or an announce message not configured to indicate BCH resource unavailability can be transmitted in sectors that have sufficient BCH resources to support the PTT session as determined in .

Each of ATs 1 . . . N receive the configured announce message and determine whether the configured announce message indicates that sufficient BCH resources are not available in . For example in each of ATs 1 . . . N check the status or logic level of the RA field included in the ACM that is appended to the announce message to determine whether the configured announce message indicates that sufficient BCH resources are not available. In another example in each of ATs 1 . . . N check the status or logic level of the ACK REQ field of the multicast DOS message to determine whether the configured announce message indicates that sufficient BCH resources are not available. In yet another example in each of ATs 1 . . . N may check the status or logic levels of both the RA field of the ACM and the ACK REQ field of the multicast DOS message to determine whether the configured announce message indicates that sufficient BCH resources are not available. Thus the logic level of a field e.g. the RA field of the ACM the ACK REQ field of the multicast DOS message etc. set at the RAN can be used to signal or convey a BCH resource status to ATs receiving the announce message. Accordingly it will be appreciated that embodiments of the present invention need not be limited to conveying the BCH resource status information with ACMs and or multicast DOS messages but rather any type of message format or field may be used to convey this information.

For convenience of explanation assume that a given AT AT 2 determines in that sufficient BCH resources are not available to support the announced PTT session in AT 2 s current sector. In AT 2 sends an announce ACK to the RAN to indicate a rejection of the announced PTT session. Conventionally the announce ACK reject message is sent by ATs that are not interested in joining or participating in an announced PTT session. However because AT 2 determines that insufficient BCH resources are available to support the announced PTT session AT 2 sends the announce ACK rejection irrespective of whether AT 2 is interested in the announced PTT session . It will be appreciated that steps and of can concurrently be performed at any number of ATs among ATs 2 . . . N.

In the RAN receives the announce ACK reject message from AT 2 and forwards the announce ACK reject message to the application server . Thus the application server does not grant the floor to AT 1 because the received announce ACK message is rejecting and not accepting the announced PTT session. Accordingly the condition of falsely granting AT 1 the floor is avoided.

In the RAN transmits a broadcast reject message BRM in each sector that is determined in to lack sufficient BCH resources to support the announced PTT session. The BRM instructs ATs to ignore the announced PTT session such that no announce ACK message e.g. neither an announce ACK accept message nor an announce ACK reject message need be sent. For a further discussion of announce ACK message suppression methodologies see U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60 974 831 entitled METHODS OF MANAGING ACKNOWLEDGMENT TRANSMISSIONS FROM MULTICAST GROUP MEMBERS OF A MULTICAST GROUP WITHIN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK filed on Sep. 24 2007 assigned to the assignee hereof and expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art by determining at the RAN whether sufficient BCH resources are available to support an announced PTT session and indicating to ATs the BCH resource status information along with the announce message the number of false grants can be reduced. The BCH resource status can be conveyed from the RAN to one or more ATs in any number of ways including but not limited to an RA field within an ACM included along with the announce message an ACK REQ field of the announce message if the announce message is converted into a multicast DOS message and transmitted on the downlink control channel a BRM sent along with the announce message and or any combination thereof.
