title: Incorporating prior knowledge into independent component analysis
abstract: The quality of sound recorded from a plurality of people speaking at the same time is improved by incorporating prior knowledge into an independent component analysis (ICA) separating algorithm. More particularly, prior knowledge is defined as a probability distribution according to some prior situation (e.g., prior distribution of people in a room). A mixture of sounds (e.g., mixture of voices) from a plurality of sources (e.g., people) captured by one or more recording devices (e.g., microphones) is separated into individual components (e.g., individual voices from respective people) by applying an maximum a posteriori (MAP) ICA algorithm which incorporates prior knowledge of the respective sources (e.g., location of sources) directly into the MAP ICA algorithm thereby allowing recovery of independent underlying sounds associated with individual sources from the mixture. Therefore, incorporating prior knowledge into an ICA algorithm provides sound quality substantially equal to existing ICA systems, but at reduced computational complexity.

In recent history advances in technology have caused the world to become increasingly integrated and globalized. Many companies are now global entities comprising offices and manufacturing sites geographically dispersed throughout the world. With such an integrated yet geographically diverse world people often need to communicate with other parties who are located far away. In order to facilitate such communication teleconferencing and video conferencing are widely used. Teleconferencing connects two or more parties over an audio network. Video conferencing further includes a camera and a video monitor allowing the parties to converse while viewing video images of each other.

Teleconferencing and videoconferencing systems are often used during meetings. During meetings situations often occur in which numerous people using a single teleconferencing device e.g. a single phone are talking over each other in a single room. In such situations the sound that is captured e.g. received by one or more microphone s of the teleconferencing device is a mixture of a plurality of voices and reverberating sounds from around the room. Blind Signal Separation BSS relates to the task of separating signals e.g. sounds when only their mixtures are observed e.g. captured . BSS has diverse applications in many fields including vision research brain imaging and telecommunications. Of particular interest to this disclosure in telecommunications BSS can be used to improve the sound quality of captured sound in digital communication such as teleconferencing voice over IP computer as a phone and speech recognition.

Recently Independent Component Analysis ICA has become a popular method of performing BSS. ICA is a computational method for separating a mixture of signals captured e.g. received from the plurality of sources into individual components associated with respective sources. For example in telecommunications ICA algorithms are designed to receive a mixture of sound e.g. mixture of voices output by a plurality of sources e.g. people from one or more recording devices e.g. microphones dispersed throughout a room e.g. in the middle of a table and unmix the captured mixture of sound to recover sound from individual sources without having any information of who the sources are or where they are located.

More particularly ICA is a form of BSS that supposes a mutual statistical independence of the source signals e.g. people s voices . When used in a telecommunication system an ICA algorithm is performed independent of assumptions regarding the room or people using the system. Instead an ICA algorithm utilizes a simple statistical model to manipulate captured signals so that statistically what comes out of each microphone is a signal that is independent from the signals coming from other microphones.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

A sound signal comprising a mixture of voices e.g. from a plurality of people speaking at the same time captured e.g. received by one or more microphones is separated by a maximum a posteriori MAP ICA algorithm utilizing prior knowledge thereby providing a sound quality substantially equal to existing ICA systems but at a reduced computational complexity.

More particularly a mixture of signals e.g. mixture of human speech from a plurality of sources e.g. people captured e.g. received by one or more recording devices e.g. microphones is separated into individual components e.g. individual voices from respective people by applying an ICA algorithm. The ICA algorithm incorporates prior knowledge defined according to a probability distribution that describes the respective sources e.g. the location of the sources directly into the ICA algorithm in a structured manner thereby allowing recovery of independent underlying signals associated with individual sources from the mixture.

Essentially a prior knowledge model e.g. a prior distribution is defined comprising information pertaining to a prior probability distribution of sources e.g. people at a prior time. Sound signals captured from a plurality of sources are then sampled and represented as a vector according to a statistical model. The signals captured by a microphone are equal to the vector multiplied by a mixing matrix. A maximum a posteriori estimate of the inverse of the mixing matrix called the unmixing matrix is formulated e.g. as a log likelihood equation incorporating prior knowledge of a prior probability distribution in a structured manner. The MAP estimate of the unmixing matrix is then enhanced. Enhancement is performed by applying an optimization algorithm that results in an enhanced unmixing matrix that can be used to determine individual sources from a captured source signal. Therefore prior knowledge incorporated into the algorithm allows the source to be determined using the ICA algorithm thereby avoiding a post algorithm processing step.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

While the method and systems provided herein are often described in relation to sound signals it will be appreciated that they can be applied to a wide range of mixed signals. For example the methods and system provided herein may be used to perform maximum a posteriori ICA for diverse applications comprising vision research brain imaging MRI biomedical signal processing etc.

As shown in when output from a dynamic processing unit dynamic processor performing an ICA algorithm respective frequency bins associated with a given source e.g. first source or second source may to go to a different channels or thereby causing respective channels or to have a mixture of frequency bins comprising sound signals from the first source white and the second source gray . For example in the first channel a first frequency bin may comprise a first speaker s voice shown in white but a second frequency bin may comprise the second speaker s voice shown in gray . As is well known in the art this is known as the the permutation problem and results in low sound quality e.g. distortion . Some ICA systems are configured to perform a post processing repair step after a dynamic processor performs an ICA algorithm to fix the permutation problem. For example a post processor may perform a repair step using attributes e.g. direction of arrival to unmix the frequency bins after the signal has been separated. However such post processing repair steps are computationally intense and undesirable. Therefore in the field of ICA there is a need for a method to prevent the permutation problem.

The techniques and systems provided herein relate to a method of performing an ICA algorithm comprising prior knowledge of the unmixing process e.g. the location of the sources which does not suffer from the permutation problem. More particularly a mixture of sounds from a plurality of sources e.g. human speech captured e.g. received by a recording device are separated into individual signals by applying a maximum a posteriori MAP ICA algorithm which incorporates prior knowledge of respective sources e.g. the location of the sources directly into the ICA algorithm in a structured manner. Incorporating prior knowledge into an ICA algorithm results in an MAP ICA algorithm that does not experience the permutation problem and thereby allows recovery of independent underlying sounds from the mixture without post processing computation e.g. a post processing repair step . Therefore a sound quality on par with existing ICA systems is provided while avoiding an expensive post processing step.

While it will be appreciated that a MAP ICA algorithm as presented herein may be applied to different types of mixing e.g. linear non linear the MAP ICA algorithm will be described according to a linear mixing of sounds output from a plurality of sources. In such a linear description a vector y captured sound vector denotes observed data e.g. a mixture of the sound captured by a recording device from the plurality of sources. The observed data y has T components the components corresponding to T independent observations y components of observed data denoted by subscripts of the captured sound e.g. y y . . . y . The sound output from respective talkers can be represented by a vector x source vector where respective components of the vector x correspond to sound output from one of the plurality of sound sources. In a linear MAP ICA algorithm the observed data y e.g. captured sound is related to an unknown value of the source vector x multiplied by a mixing matrix H e.g. y Hx . The mixing matrix H describes how sounds output e.g. the source vector x from the plurality of sources mix with each other prior to being captured. For example if there are two sources xand x and a recording device e.g. microphone captures an even mixture of sound from both sources then H is a 2 2 matrix with all values set equal to . Therefore ywould have a value of x xand ywould have x x.

Performing MAP ICA is the act of determining the unknown value of the source vector x comprising a signal from the individual sources. Based on the above linear mixing model the unknown value of the source vector x can be determined from the observed data y by finding an unmixing matrix W which is equal to the inverse of the mixing matrix H e.g. x Wy . For example if two people are talking at the same time a recording device will pick up some combination of both of the two voices mixed by the matrix H. To determine the individual voices the combination of voices must be unmixed by operating on the combination of voices with an unmixing matrix W.

At a prior knowledge model is defined. The prior knowledge model comprises information pertaining to the structure of a proper unmixing matrix. The prior knowledge model p W is defined as a probability density over real valued elements of the unmixing matrix according to some prior situation e.g. a prior distribution of people in a room . The prior knowledge model p W may be developed by any number of methods. For example the prior knowledge model p W may be formed from prior information e.g. prior experiments regarding the location of the speakers. In a further example discussed below in the prior knowledge model p W is modeled as the joint probability of N independent Gaussian distributions wherein beamforming is used to determine the parameters defining the Gaussian distributions. In another example a data driven method is used to determine the prior knowledge model p W . In the data driven method a prior knowledge model p W may be formed by running an ICA algorithm in practice and extracting information from the results. For example an ICA algorithm can be run 100 times using different people in different places. The results can be recorded and used to build a statistical data driven model.

At sound signals output from a plurality of sources are captured and converted to the frequency domain. One or more recording device s e.g. microphones can be configured to capture the sound signals. Sound signals captured by the one or more recording device s are a mixture of sound from the plurality of sources. Once captured the sound signals are converted from the time domain to the frequency domain. Conversion to the frequency domain can be performed by means of a mathematical transformation e.g. Fourier Transform for example. Conversion to the frequency domain causes the captured signals to be segmented into a plurality of frequency bins e.g. snapshots of data each bin comprising signals in a range of frequencies e.g. a subset of the captured signals frequency range . The MAP ICA algorithm may apply the same optimization strategy for k frequency bins independently resulting in a separate value of W for respective frequencies. Since respective frequency bins comprise a relatively small amount of data conversion of the captured sound signals to the frequency domain reduces the computational complexity required to determine the unmixing matrix by reducing the amount of data which must be considered for a calculation.

At a maximum a posteriori MAP estimate of the unmixing matrix is calculated incorporating the prior knowledge model. The MAP estimate of the unmixing matrix may be proportional to a posterior distribution p W y which may be expressed as the product of the prior knowledge model p W and a likelihood distribution p y W e.g. joint density of the observed data y and the unmixing matrix W. For example the MAP estimate of the unmixing matrix can be written as 

The MAP estimate of the unmixing matrix is then enhanced e.g. maximized at . Enhancement of the MAP estimate of the unmixing matrix Wis performed by application of an optimization algorithm. Enhancement provides an unmixing matrix W that both separates sources via the ICA algorithm and agrees with the prior knowledge model. Enhancement of Wcan be performed for example by finding a log likelihood function of Wand then taking the derivative of the log likelihood function with respect to W thereby resulting in an expression for the derivative of the enhanced MAP estimate of the unmixing matrix. A gradient descent algorithm can be subsequently performed on the log likelihood function to arrive at an enhanced e.g. optimal value for the unmixing matrix. For example the gradient of the log likelihood function of the unmixing matrix W may be set equal to 

The change in the unmixing matrix W computed according to method allows the use of an iterative approach to the determining the unmixing matrix. For example if Wis a current value e.g. an initial guess of the unmixing matrix and Wis the updated value W W W where W is the gradient of the log likelihood function with respect to the unmixing matrix W and is a learning rate that controls how fast the unmixing matrix adapts. At the next iteration Wbecomes the W and then Wis updated with a new value. This iterative process continues until the value of Wdoesn t change much from the value of Wand a solution is converged upon. Alternatively the iterative approach could be run for a fixed number of iterations.

At the enhanced unmixing matrix Wis used to calculate the sound output from an individual source. The enhanced unmixing matrix Wis applied to the observed data y comprising the captured sound resulting in the source vector x comprising the sound output from respective individual sources.

At the prior knowledge model e.g. prior probability distribution is expressed as a probability dependent upon an auxiliary variable. The auxiliary variable may be related to the location of sources with respect to a recording device e.g. microphone . The location of the sources e.g. represented by an angle relative to the recording device provides information about a prior unmixing matrix. For example for a microphone configured to define straight ahead as 0 if a first speaker is at 30 and a second speaker is at 40 a prior knowledge model can be determined. In one particular example the prior distribution p W can be described as 

At the posterior distribution of the unmixing matrix is expressed as a function of the auxiliary variable by incorporating the prior distribution reformulated as a function of the auxiliary variable. As consequence the posterior distribution p W y e.g. element can be described as 

The posterior distribution of the unmixing matrix is then enhanced process shown as by an iterative process comprising acts . Enhancement of the posterior distribution p W y can be performed by taking a log likelihood function of the posterior distribution p W y and then taking the derivative of the log likelihood function with respect to W. The resultant equation comprises a term representing the contribution of the prior knowledge to a MAP ICA algorithm e.g. is analogous to h W based upon the auxiliary variable. For example the term representing the prior knowledge may equal 

At a posterior probability of the auxiliary variable and the unmixing matrix is computed. The posterior probability p W is computed from the prior distribution of W over all frequency bins. In the log likelihood equation the posterior probability p W is unknown but using Bayes rule it can be formulated in terms of known quantities 

Once the posterior probability is computed expressions exist for determining the unmixing matrix Wand the posterior probability p W and method can be utilized to perform MAP ICA as shown in the method of . In particular for a given posterior probability p W the value of the unmixing matrix W can be updated to get W e.g. element . Then the new estimate of the unmixing matrix Wcan be used to update the posterior probability p W . These two acts may be iteratively repeated until to optimize both the posterior probability p W and the unmixing matrix Wuntil an optimal solution is arrived at.

At the space surrounding a recording device e.g. microphone is segmented into a plurality of regions. illustrates a 180 region surrounding a recording device segmented into four regions . In the four regions are illustrated as being 45 wide. However regions can be defined according to a user s preference and can be smaller e.g. 1 or larger e.g. 60 than the regions illustrated in .

At a beamformer e.g. ideal beamformer is estimated for a plurality of sources located within respective regions. The sources locations may be chosen randomly throughout a given region. illustrates regions comprising a plurality of randomly chosen locations respective locations associated with a different angle and a different distance relative to the recording device . For respective locations the appropriate beamformer can be directly computed. Computation of the beamformers is not described in this application as it is beyond the scope of the application.

At the estimated beamformers in a given region are averaged together to come up with an average beamformer. Information pertaining to the average beamformer can be used to form a prior knowledge model for an associated region. Since an average over a given region is used uncertainty in the direction of captured sound is allowed for.

At the prior knowledge model is defined according to the averaged beamformer estimates. More particularly the prior knowledge model may be defined as a joint probability of N independent multivariate Gaussian sources given as
