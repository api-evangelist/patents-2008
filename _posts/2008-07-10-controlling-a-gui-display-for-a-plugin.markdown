This application is a continuation application of and claims priority from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 815 214 filed on Mar. 31 2004.

The field of the invention is data processing or more specifically methods systems and products for controlling a GUI display for a plug in.

Many software infrastructures allow customers to write custom pluggable software components plug ins to meet their individual software needs. If a single static graphical user interface GUI manages the software system plug ins are not able to use the product s GUI because such GUIs do not extend interfaces through applications so as to make GUI functions accessible to plug ins. GUIs often do not extend interfaces through applications so as to make GUI functions accessible to plug ins because an application supporting plug ins often has a proprietary look and fell effected through its GUI a proprietary look and feel that may be the subject of considerable investment on the part of its developer. Some applications support plug ins with text based configuration files or even hard code configuration parameters requiring recompilation of the application in order to incorporate a plug in. Other applications use web services portlets to support GUIs requiring development of separate GUI functions for the plug ins. Both these approaches risk GUI style differences from the supporting application because they both put full GUI control in the hands of the plug in. GUI styles in plug ins that differ from the GUI style of a supporting application are undesirable because the hosting parent supporting application may lose control of the overall look and feel of its GUI presentation to users.

Methods systems and products are disclosed to provide GUI extensibility into an application supporting plug ins so that a plug in developer can use GUI functions whose operations may be controlled by the application so as to maintain the consistent look and feel of a particular application. More particularly methods systems and computer program products are provided for controlling a GUI display for a plug in in an application supporting plug ins. Embodiments include receiving at run time in the application from the plug in a request to display a GUI object responsive to the request retrieving an XML representation of the GUI object and displaying the GUI object in dependence upon the retrieved XML representation of the GUI object. Typical embodiments also include receiving from the plug in a request to retrieve user input responsive to the GUI object and returning to the plug in responsive user input.

Typical embodiments of the invention also include installing the plug in in the application including configuring the application with the location of at least one XML representation of at least one GUI object. Typical embodiments also include providing through the application for the plug in access to a subset of a set of GUI objects supported by a GUI environment. Many embodiments include providing GUI functions for the plug in through a GUI API in the application wherein receiving at run time in the application from the plug in a request for display of a GUI object includes receiving a GUI API call from the plug in. Typical embodiments include parsing the retrieved representation of the GUI object wherein displaying the GUI object include displaying the GUI object in dependence upon the parsed representation of the GUI object. Typical embodiments also include publishing XML syntax for representing XML GUI objects operable by a plug in through the application.

Methods systems and computer program products for controlling a GUI display for a plug in in an application supporting plug ins are described with reference to the drawings beginning with . sets forth a block diagram of automated computing machinery represented as a computer useful in controlling a GUI display for a plug in in an application supporting plug ins according to embodiments of the present invention. The computer of includes at least one computer processor or CPU as well as random access memory RAM . Stored in RAM is an application program and a plug in . Application programs include particular computer software instructions for controlling a GUI display for a plug in in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. A plug in hardware or software module typically adds a specific feature or service to an application.

The application of operates generally by receiving at run time from the plug in a request to display a GUI object retrieving an XML representation of the GUI object and displaying the GUI object in dependence upon the retrieved XML representation of the GUI object. In the example of the application has standards of appearance for its GUI display and the application may operate in computer by retrieving an XML representation of a GUI object that complies with the application s standards of appearance for the GUI display. By having standards of appearance and retrieving for requesting plug ins XML representations of GUI objects that comply with the application s standards of appearance application maintains control of the overall look and feel of its GUI presentation to users. Any application may support a plug in. Examples of applications that often support plug ins are email clients such as Microsoft Outlook and browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer . Popular plug ins for Internet Explorer include for example the Flash plug in from Macromedia Inc. the QuickTime plug in from Apple Computer Inc. and the RealPlayer plug in from RealNetworks Inc.

Also stored in RAM is an operating system . Operating systems useful in computers according to embodiments of the present invention include Unix Linux Microsoft NT and many others as will occur to those of skill in the art. As discussed in more detail below operating system includes GUI functions operable through an application programming interface API provided by the operating system.

The example computer of includes a communications adapter for implementing connections for data communications including connection through networks to other computers servers clients administrative devices or sleeping devices. Communications adapters implement the hardware level of connections for data communications through which local devices and remote devices or servers send data communications directly to one another and through networks. Examples of communications adapters include modems for wired dial up connections Ethernet IEEE 802.3 adapters for wired LAN connections and 802.11b adapters for wireless LAN connections.

The example computer of includes one or more input output interface adapters . Input output interface adapters in computers implement user oriented input output through for example software drivers and computer hardware such as graphics adapters for controlling output to display devices such as computer display screens as well as user input from user input devices such as keyboards and mice. GUI functions operate graphics adapters to provide GUI environments for applications and plug ins.

The term GUI object is used in this specification as a generic term for a part of a GUI that allows the user to interface with the application and operating system. GUI objects display information and support user interaction with the GUI. Examples of GUI objects include buttons dialog boxes pop up windows pull down menus icons scroll bars resizable window edges progress indicators selection boxes windows tear off menus menu bars toggle switches forms and other GUI objects that will occur to those of skill in the art. For further explanation of GUI objects refer to which depicts a graphical user interface GUI on a local host running an exemplary data communication application more particularly in the example of a browser. The browser of includes a GUI toolbar with a Back button a Forward button and buttons for refreshing the display searching printing and stopping web page retrievals each of which is a GUI object. The browser of also includes a horizontal menu containing the menu items File Edit View Bookmark called Favorites on some browsers Tools and Help. The horizontal menu is a GUI object and each of the menu items is also a GUI object. The browser of as depicted has been operated to point to a web site named SomeSearchEngine.com as shown in the title bar of the browser display . The title bar is the title bar for a GUI window. The GUI window is a GUI object and the title bar is a GUI object.

The locations within the computer system of the application configuration data the XML representation of GUI objects and the plug in are not limitations of the invention. The file system the configuration data the XML representation and the plug in can be located anywhere in cyberspace that can be located with a Universal Resource Locator URL . Some applications for example expose an API for GUI functions through a web services portlet and in such systems a plug in may execute on another computer located remotely across a network from the computer the application is on.

Both of the exemplary systems of operate generally by receiving at run time in the application from the plug in a request to display a GUI object retrieving an XML representation of the GUI object in response to the request and displaying the GUI object in dependence upon the retrieved XML representation of the GUI object. In both of the illustrated exemplary systems of application has standards of appearance for its GUI display and retrieving an XML representation of the GUI object is carried out by retrieving an XML representation of the GUI object that complies with the application s standards of appearance for the GUI display . By having standards of appearance and retrieving for requesting plug ins XML representations of GUI objects that comply with the application s standards of appearance application in the system of and in the system of maintains control of the overall look and feel of its GUI presentation to users.

The application of includes a plug in display engine . The plug in display engine includes GUI functions . A GUI function is a software routine that displays and administers GUI objects displaying GUI objects on displays operated through GUI adapters and adapter drivers and retrieving user input through input adapters such as for example mouse adapters and keyboard adapters operated by input adapter drivers . The plug in display engine exposes an API for the plug in to use in accessing the GUI functions . The plug in display engine also includes rules governing the scope of the GUI functionality that is made accessible to the plug in . Examples of rules governing the scope of the GUI functionality that is made accessible to the plug in include 

The plug in display engine of operates generally by providing through the application for the plug in access to a subset of a set of GUI objects supported by a GUI environment. In the example of an overall GUI environment is provided by an operating system which provides GUI functions . The GUI functions of the operating system are accessible to the application through an API exposed to the application by the operating system . Subject to the rules the plug in display engine provides through its GUI functions all or a portion of the GUI functions of the overall GUI environment. While in the example of the operating system provides the overall GUI environment for the application this is not a limitation of the scope of the invention. GUI environments may be provided by applications as a toolset at the application level outside the operating system or any other application and otherwise as will occur to those of skill in the art.

As just mentioned above the plug in display engine of provides through its GUI functions all or a portion of the GUI functions of the overall GUI environment. Because a plug in display engine may not support all the GUI functions of a particular GUI environment like a particular operating system for example developers of applications that support plug ins according to the present invention can publish a list of GUI objects supported by the application the list comprising a subset of the set of GUI objects supported by a GUI environment. A list of supported GUI objects advantageously allows plug in developers to write plug ins for applications that support plug in according to embodiments of the present invention. Developers of applications supporting plug ins may advantageously publish XML syntax for representing XML GUI objects operable by a plug in through the application. Exemplary ways of publishing XML syntax for representing XML GUI objects include XML Document Type Definitions DTDs and XML schema. Such a DTD or schema may be published by storing the DTD or schema at a location in cyberspace such as for example a location identified by a URL such as http www.gui.obj guiObjects syntax.dtd. Then when a DTD named syntax.dtd is stored at the location identified by that URL any XML document can use that DTD to determine syntax for representing GUI object by including these declarations in the XML document for example 

The exemplary system of operates generally by providing GUI functions for the plug in through a GUI API in the application . At run time the plug in requests display of GUI objects by calling GUI functions through the API . The plug in display engine receives requests for display of GUI objects as GUI API calls from the plug in . In response to requests for display of GUI objects the plug in display engine of retrieves XML representations of the GUI objects from a file system and displays the GUI objects in dependence upon the retrieved XML representations by calling GUI functions in the operating system through an API . In the example of the GUI functions display the GUI objects through a driver and an adapter .

In the example of the plug in display engine also receives from the plug in requests to retrieve user input responsive to displayed GUI objects. Requests to retrieve user input may be implemented synchronously as blocking calls that wait for user input. Alternatively requests to retrieve user input may be implemented as calls that register the plug in or a software object in the plug in as a listener with the plug in display engine . The plug in display engine returns to the plug in responsive user input made available to the plug in display engine through an adapter driver and GUI functions in the operating system.

The method of also includes parsing the retrieved representation of the GUI object where displaying the GUI object further comprises displaying the GUI object in dependence upon the parsed representation of the GUI object. Here is an example of an XML representation of GUI objects 

This example describes a window entitled MyWindow configured to display in the top left area of a display screen sized at 200 by 300 pixels. The window is represented to contain a dialogue box that will display the text Display Something The dialogue box is represented to contain two buttons a Yes button and a No button. The method of also includes displaying the GUI object in dependence upon the retrieved XML representation of the GUI object. A plug in display engine is unlikely to operate directly against XML in text form however. The exemplary XML representation of a window may therefore be parsed for example into the following structure expressed for example in C C or Java 

The method of also includes receiving from the plug in a request to retrieve user input responsive to the GUI object and returning to the plug in responsive user input. In the GUI window described above for example user input may select or operate one of the buttons to display something or refrain from displaying something.

In view of these descriptions of exemplary embodiments readers will recognize that embodiments of the present invention advantageously provide GUI extensibility into an application supporting plug ins so that a plug in developer can use GUI functions whose operations may be controlled by the application so as to maintain the consistent look and feel of an application. It will be understood from the foregoing description that modifications and changes may be made in various embodiments of the present invention without departing from its true spirit. The descriptions in this specification are for purposes of illustration only and are not to be construed in a limiting sense. The scope of the present invention is limited only by the language of the following claims.
