The present application claims priority from Provisional U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 60 949 800 filed Jul. 13 2007 and entitled Systems and Methods for Dynamic Pay for Performance Advertisements the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The present application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 624 613 filed Jan. 18 2007 and entitled Methods and Apparatuses for Pay for Deal Advertisements and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 688 245 filed Mar. 19 2007 and entitled Methods and Apparatuses for Prioritizing Featured Listings which is a continuation in part application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 559 860 filed Nov. 14 2006 and claimed priority from Provisional U.S. Patent Application 60 862 707 filed Oct. 24 2006 which is a continuation in part application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 072 147 filed Mar. 3 2005 and claimed priority from Provisional U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 60 656 637 filed Feb. 25 2005. The disclosures of the parent applications are incorporated herein by reference.

At least some embodiments disclosed herein relate to communication connections and advertising in general and more particularly but not exclusively to performance based advertising to provide connections for real time communications such as connecting people for telephonic conversation chat in text voice and or video document sharing screen sharing application sharing etc.

Telephone systems allow users to conduct real time two way voice communication. Traditional land line based telephone systems connect one telephone set to another through one or more switching centers operated by one or more telephone companies over a land line based telephone network. Traditionally a telephone connection is based on a circuit switched network.

Current telephone systems may also use a packet switched network for a telephone connection. A packet switched network is typical in a computer data environment. Recent developments in the field of Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP allow the delivery of voice information using the Internet Protocol IP in which voice information is packaged in a digital form in discrete packets rather than in the traditional circuit committed protocols of the public switched telephone network PSTN .

Cellular networks allow a cellular phone to connect to a nearby cellular base station through an air interface for wireless access to a telephone network. Recent developments in wireless telephone systems allow not only voice communications but also data communications. For example cellular phones can now receive and send short messages through a Short Message Service SMS . Web pages can now be retrieved through wireless cellular links and displayed on cellular phones. Wireless Application Protocol WAP has been developed to overcome the constraints of relatively slow and intermittent nature of wireless links to access information similar or identical to World Wide Web.

Telephone companies provide a number of convenient features such as call forwarding. Call forwarding of a telephone system allows a user of a phone at a given phone number to dial a specific sequence on the phone to cause the telephone system to forward incoming calls addressed to the phone number to another specified phone number indicated by the dialed sequence.

Telephone systems are frequently used in conducting business. Telephone numbers are typically provided in advertisements web sites directories etc. as a type of contact information to reach businesses experts persons etc.

The Internet is becoming an advertisement media to reach globally populated web users. Advertisements can be included in a web page that is frequently visited by web users. Typically the advertisements included in the web pages contain only a limited amount of information e.g. a small paragraph an icon etc. . The advertisements contain links to the web sites that provide further detailed information. In certain arrangements the advertisers pay the advertisements based on the number of visits directed to their web sites by the links of the advertisements.

Performance based advertising generally refers to a type of advertising in which an advertiser pays only for a measurable event that is a direct result of an advertisement being viewed by a consumer. For example in one form of performance based search advertising an advertisement is included within a result page of a keyword search. Each selection click of the advertisement from the results page is the measurable event for which the advertiser pays. In other words payment by the advertiser is on a per click basis in such advertising.

Methods and apparatuses to dynamically determine the performance event of a listing based on the progress levels of responses received in response to a presentation of the listing are described here. Some embodiments are summarized in this section.

One embodiment includes providing a listing on behalf of an entity for presentation to a user identifying an event from a set of predetermined events based on communications made by the user responsive to a presentation of the listing and charging the entity a fee per the event identifying from the set of predetermined events.

The present disclosure includes methods and apparatuses which perform these methods including data processing systems which perform these methods and computer readable media which when executed on data processing systems cause the systems to perform these methods.

Other features of the disclosure will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description which follows.

In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the description. It will be apparent however to one skilled in the art that embodiments of the disclosure can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the description.

Reference in this specification to one embodiment or an embodiment means that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the disclosure. The appearances of the phrase in one embodiment in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment nor are separate or alternative embodiments mutually exclusive of other embodiments. Moreover various features are described which may be exhibited by some embodiments and not by others. Similarly various requirements are described which may be requirements for some embodiments but not other embodiments.

In the disclosure the term advertisement may refer to various different forms of presentations to attract attention or patronage. An advertisement may be simply a listing of identity and contact information e.g. in a web page a print media a telephonic listing service etc. or a passage including one or more statements about business offering etc. or a banner with graphical content and or animation embedded in a web page or a voice message presented in a voice channel e.g. radio broadcasting a voice portal with Interactive Voice Response IVR which may accept user input through voice recognition or through keypad input generated Dual Tone Multi Frequency DTMF signals or others.

In one embodiment a listing is presented to a user to provide the user with a communication reference which can be used to request a connection for real time communications between the user and the entity of the listing such as for telephonic conversations instant messaging chat in text voice and or video screen sharing or application sharing etc. The entity of the listing may be an advertiser who offers an advertisement fee for being presented or a business entity a seller an advisor an information provider or a service provider such as a provider for entertainment amusement etc. A listing may include text graphical presentation and or audio or voice.

A listing may or may not be provided on behalf of an advertiser for a fee. For example a directory service provider may compile listings of some businesses or sellers without the businesses or sellers explicitly request the directory service provider to advertise for them. A business or seller presented by a listing may or may not pay an advertisement fee for the presentation of the listing and or for the lead to the customers resulting from the presentation of the listing.

For example a community of users may create listings of businesses sellers etc. based on the recommendation of the users. In one embodiment a listing can be created and edited by the community of users of telephonic apparatuses such as softphones cellular phones or smart phones. The users can provide edit and or modify a description comments ratings etc. about a business or service provider that is identified by a telephonic reference such as a telephone number of the business or service provider. Alternatively the listings may have a portion of description that can be edited by the respective advertiser but not by other users. The listing database represents a business directory and the entities represented by the listings may not pay any fee for being presented. Some of the entities may offer a fee for preferred placement in presentation. In one embodiment the users may be charged a communication fee for communicating with the entities featured in the listings when the users use the softphones cellular phones or smart phones to communicate with the entities.

In one embodiment an advertiser of an advertisement is charged an advertisement fee based on the performance of the advertisement e.g. a telephonic connection to a customer a lead for real time communication with a customer a deal completed with the customer as a result of the performance a subscription fee for a number of bundled leads or deals etc. .

In one embodiment a listing is provided to allow a customer to be connected to a seller and the connection provider can charge the customer on behalf of the seller for transactions conducted over the connection provided between the customer and the seller. In one embodiment the user terminals provided to the customer and the sellers are configured to charge the customer on behalf of the seller for the transactions. The customers and or the sellers may also be charged for the communication connection. Alternatively the communication connection may not be charged explicitly and the communication cost can be covered via the commission fees for charging the customer on behalf of the seller and or the advertisement fees.

In one embodiment a presented listing includes a telephonic reference which is used to identify an end point on a telephonic network for a telephonic connection to the end point . The telephonic network may be a circuit switched network or a packet switched network or a combination of one or more circuit switched networks and one or more packet switched networks. For example the telephonic reference may be a telephone number with an extension a telephone number without an extension a session initiation protocol SIP uniform resource identifier URI a user identifier of an instant messaging network a user identifier of a Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP network or a user identifier of a peer to peer VoIP network etc.

In one embodiment the telephonic references presented in some of the listings are references assigned by a connection server such that when the references are used the connection server is in the path of a call for a connection between the caller and the callee. For example the connection server may be requested to call back the caller and to call the callee separately to connect the caller and the callee according to an assigned reference. For example the connection server may receive a call as an end point specified by an assigned reference and then further connect the call to the callee based on the assigned reference used to receive the call. For example the connection server may be queried to provide a telephonic reference of the callee according to an assigned reference to allow the caller s device to initiate the call to the callee using the provided reference. For example the connection server may decrypt or decode an encrypted encoded phone number of the callee for the caller s device and track the calls made by the caller s device through the decrypting or decoding process.

For example in one embodiment when an assigned reference is used to call for connections the user is connected to a connection server as an end point. The connection server determines the communication reference of the advertiser based on the assigned reference used to connect the user and the connection server and then further connects the user to the advertiser. Through the use of the assigned reference the connection server is in the path of connecting the user and the advertiser to track the connection made via the advertisement.

For example the assigned reference can be a telephone number of the connection server which when called by the user can be used to determine the telephone number of the advertiser and the telephone number of the advertiser can be used to further connect the call to the advertiser. For example the assigned reference may be a reference to request a callback to the user to connect to the advertiser. For example the assigned reference can be an identifier of the advertiser such as a user ID of the advertiser a SIP URL of the advertiser etc. The assigned reference can be passed to the connection server in a call signaling message of a VoIP call be used to request a server to resolve the reference into a direct reference for use in a network or be used to report to a server about the call to the advertiser.

In another embodiment the telephonic references for some of the listings are designed to be used on telephonic apparatuses which are configured to track the calls made via the telephonic references and or to report the calls made via the telephonic references. Thus information about the calls made via the telephonic references can be used at a server to bill advertisers per connections made via the advertisements to charge the customers on behalf of advisers or sellers service providers to compensate partners based on the call activities etc.

In a further embodiment the telephonic references for some of the listings are designed to be used on telephonic apparatuses which are configured to maintain account information or to communicate with servers of financial institutions to bill advertisers and or charge the customers on behalf of advisers sellers or service providers.

In one embodiment the user terminals that are designed to make the connections via the advertisement use the assigned reference to track the connections and report to a server the connection made via the advertisement. For example softphones can be designed to make direct connections over a peer to peer network without going through a centralized connection server. The softphones can be configured to report the calls made via the advertisements to a server for tracking. Alternatively the softphones may be configured to deduct fees or transfer funds via accounts maintained by the softphones or accounts accessible individually by the softphones.

In one embodiment a click to call button includes a reference to the callee which when selected causes a telephonic apparatus used by the user such as a softphone a cellular phone or a smart phone to start a process to call the callee. The reference to the callee may be a SIP address of a connection server encoded with a phone number of the callee which can be decoded by the connection server to further connect the call to the callee. The reference to the callee may be an encrypted phone number of the callee which is to be decrypted by a server to allow the telephonic apparatus to call the callee directly e.g. via a peer to peer network . In one embodiment the reference can further include parameters such as the search terms used to locate the listings the time stamp of the search an electronic coupon promotion a bid price for advertisement fee and or a price for the service offered by a seller etc. In one embodiment the telephonic apparatus is configured to report a call resulted from the advertisement to a server for tracking and or billing purposes.

In another embodiment a click to call button is designed to request a connection server to call back to the customer for a connection to the entity of the listing. The click to call button may cause the presentation of an interface to guide the customer through the calling processing and or to collect a callback reference from the customer e.g. via a web page . In some embodiments the callback reference such as the telephone number of the customer can be determined automatically from the identity of the customer or the identity of the device used by the customer. For example a telephone number of the customer can be looked up from the account of the customer after the customer is authenticated.

In one embodiment a telephonic apparatus is a softphone implemented at least in part via software such as an instant messenger a VoIP client application running on a computer an applet embedded in a web page a built in or plug in module of a web browser a handheld device a personal digital assistant a cellular phone a cordless phone a Bluetooth phone a WiFi phone etc. The telephonic apparatus may be designed to make a connection based on Internet Protocol based on a peer to peer network based on software and or based on a connection to a server or a host computer etc. In some embodiments the telephonic apparatus is implemented via hardwire circuitry such Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC in some embodiments the telephonic apparatus is implemented partially via special purpose hardwire circuitry and partially via software such as Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC or Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA with software firmware and in some embodiments the telephonic apparatus is implemented using a set of general purpose hardwire components that are under the control of software.

The contact of the user A is stored in the database and a reference is assigned to represent the contact. Instead of providing the contact to customers the reference representing the contact is provided through the media to user B . Thus when the user B uses the reference to request a connection with the user A the connections resulted from the advertisement can be tracked to evaluate the performance.

In one embodiment advertisements can be distributed via a number of media channels operated by a number of demand partners. The reference can also be assigned to identify the demand partners and or the media channels used to distribute the advertisements. In one embodiment the information obtained from tracking the demand partners who are responsible for the delivery of a communication lead is used to compensate the demand partner for each delivered communication lead. Alternatively the demand partners may be compensated according to the advertisement presentations made for the advertiser and tracked information can be used to determine the performance and or the cost effectiveness of the media channels.

In one embodiment the reference can be presented via a variety of media channels such as a virtual reality environment newspaper magazine telephone directory web search results VoIP user terminals interactive maps banners directory assistance service online marketplace mobile communication devices radio cable satellite television interactive television web television voice portal web portal online auction site blog email bulletin board refrigerate magnet brochure etc.

In the user B can use the reference obtained from media to request the connection provider to establish a connection or facilitate a communication channel for real time communications between the user A and the user B . The connection provider uses the database to determine the contact of the user A and then make a connection between the user A and user B using the contact of the user A . Alternatively the reference may include an encoded encrypted version of the contact of the user A which can be decoded decrypted without relying upon the database .

In response to the user B s request for a connection the connection provider may establish two separate connections to the user A and the user B and then bridge the two connections to connect the user A and user B . For example the connection provider may determine the reference from a connection established between the user B and connection provider and then further bridge the connection to the user A .

In one embodiment the connection provider may provide a separate reference to represent the user B and allow the user A to subsequently callback to the user B via the reference that represents the user B if the user A is not currently available for real time communications. The connection provider may schedule an appointment for the user A and user B for a real time communication session. The connection provider may send a notification to the user A to inform the user A about the request for a real time communication.

Alternatively the user terminal of the user B may provide the encoded encrypted version of the contact of the user A to the connection provider for a decoded decrypted version of the contact of the user A just in time when the user terminal of the user B is ready to make a direct connection with a user terminal of the user A . For example the user terminal of the user B can use the decoded decrypted contact of the user A to make a peer to peer connection with the user terminal of the user A without going through the connection provider and providing the decoded decrypted contact can be considered a proxy event of a connection between the user terminal of the user B and the user terminal of the user A . Alternatively or in combination the user terminal of the user B and or the user terminal of the user A can be configured to report to the connection provider the connection between the user terminals. For example a reporting message may include a call detail record CDR indicating the time period of the connection.

In one embodiment the connection provider tracks the connections made via the reference for billing for the advertisement. For example the connection provider may charge the advertiser for each communication lead deliver to the user A .

A communication lead may be limited to a distinct separate customer such that repeated calls from the same customer within a predefined time period may not be counted as separate communication leads. In one embodiment the communication lead may also be limited by the duration of a communication session such that a short session having a duration shorter than a predefined time period may not be counted as a communication lead and or a long session having a duration longer than a predefined time period may be counted as more than one communication lead.

In one embodiment a number of communication leads may be bundled as a package for a subscription fee or a bid price. Further the delivery of communication leads may be bundled with an offer of a telecommunication service package. Alternatively the advertiser may specify a bid price that is to be charged for each communication lead delivered or a bid limit e.g. maximum bid which is to be resolved into an actual bid based on the bid prices of competitors in a category for a specific geographic service area.

In an interface allows the advertiser to describe an offer or a switch pitch or a cross sell or some advertising content . The advertiser can specify the business contact information for the advertisement including the business name street mailing address phone number and fax number. The advertiser seller is encouraged to tell customers via concise marketing messages what is being offered and why the customers should call the advertiser seller. For example the advertiser is encouraged to include promotional offers in the marketing messages to get buyers to call the advertiser. Examples of promotional offers include Call today and get 5 off Free consultation limited time and Call now and save 10 . 

In one embodiment an audio and or visual advertisement is generated based at least in part on the information submitted by the advertiser via the user interface e.g. for presentation via virtual realty directory assistance service search result etc. 

In one embodiment a short audio advertisement is generated based on the concise marketing message e.g. two sentences each having a length limit such as 35 characters . The concise marketing message can be read by a human to generated a recorded audio file for a short audio advertisement or be converted into an audio message via a text to speech synthesizer. In one embodiment the audio advertisement also includes the business name.

In one embodiment a visual presentation of the advertisement may be used to supplement the audio advertisement. For example the address of the advertisement can be presented in a visual advertisement together with additional information that is specified in the business profile page of the advertisement. In response to a request from the customer the visual component of the advertisement can be sent to the customer via an SMS message via an email via a custom application via a web WAP page etc.

In one embodiment the advertisement is sent to a user device in text according to a pre determined format e.g. in XML or a custom designed format to allow a client application running on the user device to present the advertisement in a custom format. For example the client application may present the short marketing advertisement in an audio form via a text to speech synthesize and the present a selected portion of the advertisement as an animation e.g. present an electronic coupon via an animation . For example a Java applet can be downloaded into the browser of the user to facilitate VoIP based phone communication and perform at least part of the text to speech operations to enable improved compression in transmitting audio advertisements.

In one embodiment when an advertisement is presented to the user via a web or a virtual reality environment the short audio advertisement can also be included and the audio advertisement can be played automatically or after the user selects the advertisement.

In the interface may be implemented as a web page. Alternatively an advertisement may submit the advertising content via a custom client application or via a message gateway e.g. an instant message an email an SMS message etc. . In one embodiment one or more advertisements can be uploaded into a server via a spreadsheet or via a web service interface.

In one embodiment the system converts the text input received from the advertiser into an audio advertisement. In one embodiment the audio file for the advertisement is stored in the advertisement database alternatively the text input can be converted into the audio advertisement e.g. via a text to speech synthesizer or a human announcer when the audio advertisement is needed. In one embodiment the machine synthesized audio recording are stored in the database for a period of time and deleted if not used after a predetermined period of time or when the usage of the audio advertisement is lower than a threshold.

In the interface allows the entity e.g. an advisor an entertainer an information provider a consultant etc. to specify the price of the service offered by the entity. For example the entity may allow a customer to talk to the entity for free for a period of time specified in the entry box or allow an indefinite period of free communication time. For example the entity may request the customer to accept a charge after a period of free time or request the customer to accept a charge before being connected to the entity. For example the entity may request the customer to accept a per minute price before the customer is being connected to the entity for real time communication. Alternatively the entity may provide a period of free communication time to the customer for a taste of the service before requiring a per minute price specified in the interface .

In the entity can also specify a price for a specified period of time such as 25.00 for 30 minutes and a policy to continue beyond the 30 minutes. For example the entity may request 25.00 for each additional 30 minutes in a communication session or request the system to end the call after the initially purchased 30 minute communication session or no long charge the customer if the customer wishes to continue the conversation beyond the initially purchased 30 minute communication session.

In one embodiment the entity can specified a set of multiple prices for different purchase options and the entity can negotiate with a customer during an initially free communication time period to select a price.

Alternatively the entity may be compensated according to a flat rate specified by the system for services provided to the customers of the system.

In one embodiment the system can store multiple phone numbers of the seller. The system can intelligent route a call to the seller according to the preference of the seller. For example in the advertiser seller may choose a preferred phone number from a set of phone numbers of the seller to receive incoming calls using the option group in the user interface . The seller may indicate whether the seller is currently available to take calls or is to be taken off call e.g. using the check box .

In one embodiment the owner of the listing e.g. seller advertiser advisor entertainer consultant etc. can request the system to make concurrent calls to the multiple phone numbers. The owner of the listing can use any of the telephonic apparatuses connected at the multiple phone numbers to answer the call.

For example an advertiser may have multiple telephonic apparatuses at different telephonic references. A connection server can assign a telephonic reference to an advertisement of the advertiser. When a customer calls the connection server at the telephonic reference assigned to the advertisement the connection server can further connect the call from the customer to the advertiser via multiple concurrent calls to the different telephonic references of the advertiser. Thus the advertiser can take the call to talk to the customer via any of the multiple telephonic apparatuses of the advertiser.

In one embodiment during the conversation between the customer and the advertiser the advertiser may request the connections server to reconnect the call to a different telephonic apparatus. For example the connection server can place one or more separate concurrent calls to the telephonic references that are currently not in use for the conversation between the customer and the advertiser and then join the separate calls with the existing calls in a conference. This allows the advertiser to switch from one phone to another during the conversation and to bring family friends colleagues and or third parties into the conversation.

In one embodiment separate concurrent calls can be placed to the telephonic references of the advertiser that are specified prior to the customer s call such as specified via the user interface . Alternatively the advertiser can request a separate call to a telephonic reference specified in the request during the conversation with the customer. For example the advertiser may provide the telephonic reference of a third party to invite the third party to join the conversation.

In one embodiment the system is configured to drop the other concurrent calls when the one of the concurrent calls is answered. Thus the first answering telephonic apparatus is selected for the connection although multiple concurrent calls were initially placed.

In one embodiment when multiple telephonic apparatus of the customer or the advertiser are answered substantially at the same time in response to the concurrent calls one of the answering telephonic apparatus is selected for the connection while the others are disconnected. The selection can be performed based on a set of predefined priorities among the telephonic references or based on statistics data about past answered calls. For example the frequencies of the calls being answered on the multiple telephonic references can be used to select the telephonic apparatus that most frequently answered the previous concurrent calls e.g. previous concurrent calls within the same time window of the day as the current call . For example the telephonic apparatus that most recently answered the prior concurrent calls can be selected for the current connection request. Alternatively a random selection from the answering devices can be used to select telephonic apparatus for the current connection request.

In one embodiment the multiple telephonic references of the advertiser are called for up to a predetermined period of time to allow one or more of the multiple concurrent calls being answered. One or more answered calls can be joined with the call or calls with the other party in a conference. This provides a convenient mechanism to set up a conference call among multiple persons between the customer and the advertiser.

Alternatively the multiple telephone numbers of the advertiser can be called sequentially to connect the advertiser to the customer.

In one embodiment the system allows the seller to specify the schedule to receive calls and the schedule is displayed to the seller in a graphical way to help the seller to manage calls. In the user interface includes a link which can be selected to display a user interface not shown in to manage the schedule .

In one embodiment when the schedule or the check button indicates that the advertiser seller is currently not available to take calls for real time communications the system can decrease the priority of the advertisement for this advertiser or stop temporarily the presentation of advertisements for this advertiser. When there is a call intended for the advertiser at a time when the advertiser is not taking calls e.g. according to the schedule the system can block the call or direct the call into a voice mail for the advertiser or arrange a call at an alternative time or obtain a callback number to allow the advertiser to initiate a callback to the customer.

In the user interface also includes a summary of call activities. Buttons and can be selected to show graphical representation of the call activities and further details of the call activities.

As the phone calls pass through the system a wide array of information can be collected and tracked including day date time of calls duration of calls call status answered no answer busy inbound phone numbers etc. Such tracked information can be used in counting communication leads generated from advertisements. For example when multiple calls are made from the same user to the same seller within a period of time e.g. a day or a week or in connection with the same offered or auctioned item these multiple calls can be considered as one qualified call or a single lead.

In one embodiment different types of communication references can be dynamically selected for advertisements to represent the contact information of the corresponding advertisers. A communication reference used to represent the contact of an advertiser may be a traditional phone number with or without an extension a click to call reference a SIP address for VoIP call a click to reveal reference etc. The communication reference can be embedded into an advertisement to count the communication leads generated from advertisements to track the contributions of demand partners who operate media channels to present the advertisements to customers and or to track other aspects of advertising such as partners who bring the advertisers sellers to the system and the keywords responsible for the selection of the advertisement for presentation.

In one embodiment the tracking mechanism used for a particular version of a particular advertisement is selected from a number of available mechanisms based on one or more considerations such as the volume or frequency of calls generated from the advertisement the conversion rate of the advertisement e.g. the ratio between a count of presentations of the advertisement and a count of communication leads generated from the presentations the price per communication lead that the advertiser is willing to pay for the advertisement according to a price bid specified by the advertiser a potential revenue for a particular party in the advertising activity a classification or category of the advertisement e.g. the category of service or product advertised in the advertisement a geographical area served by the advertisement the demand partner who is going to present the advertisement e.g. the success rate of the demand partner in reaching viable customers in comparison with other demand partners etc.

In a pool of different types of references is maintained such as local phone numbers 800 numbers 888 numbers 877 numbers 866 numbers . Some of the references can be dynamically generated and used such as extensions SIP addresses click to assign references and click to callback references . In one embodiment one or more of the references are selected and used as the assigned reference that is embedded in the advertisement . In one embodiment the assignment is based at least partially on factors related to the advertisement such as call volume conversion rate revenue potential category geography demand partner etc.

In one embodiment the reference of a particular type is selected and assigned to the advertisement when the advertisement is being requested for delivery. When the advertisement is subsequently requested the previously assigned reference can be used. Alternatively when the advertisement is subsequently requested a different reference of a re selected type can be selected and assigned to the advertisement based on the considerations such as the call volume in a past time period conversion rate price bid etc. After the new reference is assigned to the advertisement the previous reference can be assigned to a different advertisement.

In one embodiment before the expiration of the previously assigned reference for an advertisement delivered by a demand partner a new reference can be assigned to the advertisement for delivery by the same demand partner. Thus multiple references can be associated with a same set of parameters in a time period. Further since some of the references can be re assigned to a different advertisement one reference may be associated with multiple sets of parameters e.g. for different advertisements . In one embodiment when a reference is associated multiple sets of parameters the parameter set that is most recently assigned to and associated with an advertisement has the highest priority and when the reference is used to request a communication connection with an advertiser the customer can be prompted to confirm the set of parameters directly or indirectly before the set of parameters are used to connect the customer to the advertiser.

In one embodiment a communication reference that is specific to a selected tracking mechanism is allocated or selected or generated for a particular advertisement. The communication reference is embedded into the advertisement to generate a particular version of the advertisement.

In one embodiment the tracking mechanism is selected at a time when the particular version of the advertisement is needed for presentation e.g. when the version of the advertisement is to be delivered to a media channel a demand partner or to a web browser of a customer . The corresponding communication reference is allocated or selected or generated when the tracking mechanism is selected.

In one embodiment the selected tracking mechanism can be dynamically changed at a time when the particular version of the advertisement is needed for presentation e.g. when the version of the advertisement is to be delivered to a demand partner or to a web browser of a customer . For example the tracking mechanism used in an advertisement that is to be presented via a particular demand partner can be upgraded or downgraded based on the statistical data collected from the past activities related to the advertisement.

In one embodiment a version of an advertisement can have multiple assigned references corresponding to different types of tracking mechanisms. For example a version of an advertisement may include a SIP address a reference to arrange a callback and a reference to request an assigned phone number.

The SIP address may be presented in a click to call format via a VoIP application. When the customer has a VoIP application readily available the customer may choose to make the phone call via the SIP address without requesting for a traditional telephone number.

The reference to arrange a callback can be implemented as a link or a button labeled as Request a phone connection through calling me back . In one embodiment a form to take the callback number is presented with the link or button. Alternatively when the link or the button is selected a further interface e.g. a web page a dialog box etc. can be displayed to guide the customer through the process of connecting the customer to the advertiser through calling back the customer.

The reference to request an assigned phone number can be implemented as a link or a button labeled as Show me a phone number which when selected causes a phone number to be assigned to the version of the advertisement. After a phone number is assigned to the version of the advertisement the advertisement can be subsequently displayed with the assigned phone number without showing the reference to request an assigned phone number.

Alternatively when the Show me a phone number link or button is selected the complete phone number of the advertiser can be shown to allow the customer to call the advertiser directly. In such an implementation the number of times that the advertiser s phone number is clicked to reveal can be used as a performance indicator based on which the advertisement is charged for.

In one embodiment after a period of time of serving the advertisement statistical data related to consumer responses to the advertisement can be collected and used to adjust the tracking mechanisms for the advertisement. For example if it is determined that the majority of the phone calls in response to the advertisement is via the SIP address other tracking mechanisms may be de allocated from the advertisement or re allocated for a different advertisement. Alternatively the reference may be phased out from the advertisement while the reference is allocated to a different advertisement.

For instance if an advertisement has a high call volume e.g. receives many calls it may be upgraded for a more expensive method of tracking. An advertisement with an extension may be upgraded to a local phone number without an extension or even a vanity toll free number if the performance of the advertisement is above a threshold e.g. when its conversion rate or call volume is high . Conversely advertisements that perform poorly may be downgraded in tracking methods used. For example an advertisement tracked by a toll free number without an extension may be downgraded to have a number with an extension a click to call connection mechanism.

The tracking mechanism of an advertisement can be determined not only by the performance of an advertisement but also by the quality of the demand partner or the quality of the customer viewing the advertisement. For example one advertisement may use an expensive tracking mechanism on one demand partner but may be assigned a different inexpensive tracking mechanism on a second demand partner who tends to have lower quality customers e.g. customers who response less frequently to advertisements . The quality of a demand partner may be reflected upon on the difference in the conversion rate of a same advertisement presented via different demand partners in the numbers of the potential customers the demand partners can reach the quality of the customers of the demand partners etc. In another embodiment the tracking mechanism is directly determined by the quality of the customer himself herself. For instance information can be collected about the customer interacting with the advertisements if the customer is a frequent buyer an expensive tracking mechanism can be used for the customer. The quality of a customer may also reflected upon the preferences of the customer the spending habit of the customer the response rate of the customer to advertisements the need of the customer etc. In this case different customers of different buying tendencies may see the advertisement using different tracking mechanisms at the same demand partners.

In one embodiment the likelihood of an advertisement being called is estimated based on the type of media channels used to present the advertisement the demand partner responsible to deliver the advertisement and or the customer who views the advertisement. Any characteristics in advertising that have an impact on the likelihood of an advertisement being called and thus the expected revenue profit generated from the presentation of the advertisement can be used in selecting a tracking mechanism for the particular instance of the advertisement.

In one example if it is determined that the number of communication leads generated from the assigned phone number is lower than a threshold the assigned phone number may be reallocated to another advertisement. If the number of communication leads generated from the advertisement is higher than a threshold the tracking mechanism used for the advertisement may be promoted to a phone number with a short or vanity extension a phone number without an extension a vanity phone number a toll free phone number a vanity toll free number a local phone number or a vanity local phone number. If the number of communication leads generated from the advertisement is lower than a threshold the tracking mechanism may be downgraded freeing up tracking resources for other advertisements.

In one example when advertisements are provided to a demand partner that has a lower success rate in reaching viable customers than other demand partners this demand partner may be represented using a long extension leaving short extensions for other demand partners. Alternatively the advertisements for presentation by the demand partner may be tracked using references for callback or SIP addresses.

In one example the system may promote the advertisement activities in one geographic area and the advertisements served in that geographic area receive upgrades in tracking mechanism.

In one example the advertisements in certain categories of products and services use upgraded tracking mechanisms.

In one embodiment the advertisements with a pay per communication lead price bid higher than a threshold receives an upgrade in tracking mechanism.

In one embodiment the system determines weighting factors in various types of communication references e.g. in terms of cost and benefit in promoting the advertisement the success rate of the advertisement in various communication channel demand partner and the price bids of the advertisers. Based on the collected information the system can select tracking mechanisms to optimize the potential revenue that can be generated from advertising. In one embodiment the potential revenue includes the advertisement revenue and or other revenue that can be generated from the advertisement. For example when the system takes a commission from the transaction resulted from the advertisement the potential revenue can include the expected commission from the presentation of the advertisement and in such a case the system may further use the statistical data related to the successful rate of a call converting into a transaction an average value of a transaction the possibility of a repeated call the average value of a repeated call etc. in the determination of the potential revenue. In one embodiment advertisements may qualify for better tracking mechanisms when their pay per call bid price reaches a certain value. Similarly advertisements may qualify for better tracking mechanisms when their overall value reaches a certain threshold. Their overall value can be a function of their bid price ordinal position conversion rate demand source customer quality etc.

In a phone number without an extension is assigned for the generation a particular version of an advertisement . In the database the assigned phone number is associated with the media channel and the advertiser s phone number and or other parameters to be tracked . Thus the parameters to be tracked can be identified based at least partially on the assigned phone number . The particular version of the advertisement that has the assigned phone number is provided to the customer via the media channel . The advertisement may instruct or suggest the customer to call the assigned phone number to reach the advertiser. In response to the advertisement the customer may call the assigned phone number . When the connection provider is called at the assigned phone number via a telephone carrier the connection provider can identify the assigned phone number e.g. via a Dialed Number Identification Service DNIS and determine the advertiser s phone number based at least partially on the assigned phone number . Further using the assigned phone number it can also be determined that the phone call from the customer is a response to an advertisement that is delivered via the media channel based on the association between the assigned phone number and the media channel in the database .

In one embodiment after determining the advertiser s phone number from the assigned phone number that is dialed by the customer the connection provider makes a separate call to the advertiser via a telephone carrier. When both the customer and the advertiser are on the line with the connection provider the connection provider can bridge or conference the calls to connect the customer and the advertiser . Alternatively the connection provider may forward the calls from the customer to the advertiser after determining the advertiser s phone number.

In one embodiment the assigned phone number can be a phone number that is local to the area to be served by the advertisement. Alternatively the assigned phone number can be a toll free phone number such as an 800 888 877 or 866 number. In one embodiment the assigned phone number is a vanity number that spells one or more words on a dial pad on a phone such as 1 800 PLUMBER for the advertisement of a plumber. Alternatively the assigned phone number can be a plain phone number.

It is recognized that a local phone number is easy to dial manually a vanity number is easy to remember and an 800 number is easier to remember than other toll free numbers. Thus there are different values in advertising in the different types of assigned phone numbers.

Since maintaining different phone numbers may increase the tracking cost another type of tracking mechanism uses different extensions to differentiate tracked parameters. For example different root phone numbers can be used to represent different media channels and different extensions can be used to represent different advertisers. In another example different root phone numbers are used to represent different advertisers and different extensions are used to represent different media channels. In another example the entire assigned phone number including the root phone number and the extension is used as a key to look up the media channel and the advertiser s phone number. In a further example the root phone numbers are not used to differentiate tracked parameters and the tracked parameters are represented by the extensions which may be implemented as keys to look up the parameters or as encoded encrypted version of the parameters.

In one embodiment after the customer dials the root number the customer is connected to an IVR system or a human operator of the connection provider tracker. After the customer provides the extension to the IVR system or the human operator the tracked parameters such as the media channel and or the advertiser s phone number can be determined.

In one embodiment the IVR system or the human operator can prompt the customer for the extension that is provided in the advertisement. When the dialed root number is sufficient to identify information about the media channel the IVR system or the human operator may customize the prompt to include the information of the media channel and ask the customer to further provide the extension to reach the desired advertiser. When the dialed root number is sufficient to identify information about the advertiser the IVR system or the human operator may customize the prompt to include the information of the advertiser and ask the customer to further provide the extension to reach the desired advertiser.

The extension can be a plain extension or a vanity extension that spells one or more words on a dial pad on a phone such as extension PLUMBER for the advertisement of a plumber. In one embodiment extensions used in the system can have different lengths. A shorter extension is easy to dial and a vanity extension is easy to remember. In one embodiment the extension includes an encoded encrypted version of the associated parameter to allow an authorized data system to decode decrypt at least some of the parameters without having to query the database. Thus different types of extensions can have different values in advertising.

The tracking methods described can have different costs. A toll free number with many extensions for instance is much cheaper than many vanity toll free numbers. Therefore the system uses the more expensive methods when it s worthwhile to do so. For instance if an advertisement receives many calls it may be selected for a more expensive method of tracking. An advertisement with an extension may in the future be upgraded to a local phone number without an extension or even a vanity toll free number. Similarly an advertisement may qualify for a more expensive method of tracking if its conversion rate is high e.g. if it has a high ratio of the number of calls it receives to the number of times it is displayed . Conversely advertisements that perform poorly may be downgraded in tracking methods used. For example an advertisement tracked by a toll free number may be downgraded to have a less expensive click to call connection mechanism.

In one embodiment the connection provider calls the customer instead of providing a phone number to receive a phone call from the customer. For example the reference assigned to represent the contact of the advertiser may not be used to make a call via a traditional telephone carrier. The reference can be submitted to the connection provider via a data communication such as an email an SMS message a web request or other types of data communication. The reference can be used as a key in the database to look up the associated parameters such as the media channel and the advertiser s phone number. In one embodiment the reference is an encoded encrypted version of the associated parameters such that an authorized data system can decode decrypt the information without having to look up from the database. After the reference is provided to the connection provider with the request for a connection the connection provider can callback to the customer to establish the connection between the customer and the advertiser. The request may include a callback phone number of the customer. Alternatively a customer may be prompted to provide the callback phone number in response to the request. The connection provider can connect the customer and the advertiser by calling the customer and the advertiser separately and bridge conferences the calls or by forwarding one call e.g. the call to the customer to another e.g. to the advertiser .

In one embodiment a telephone number assigned to a version of an advertisement includes a SIP address for the initiation of a VoIP based telephone call. The SIP address can be used for a manually dialed call on a SIP enabled phone or be used in a click to call format. In one embodiment the SIP address includes an encoded encrypted version of the contact of the advertiser such that the connection provider can decode decrypt the contact of the advertiser from the SIP address without having to look up from database.

In one embodiment the allocation of a telephone number to an advertisement is deferred to a stage when a customer is interested in the advertisement and ready to make a phone call. A reference embedded in the advertisement can be used to specifically request for the telephone number that is assigned to the advertiser by the connection provider. The request can be sent as a web request in response to a click on a link or as an email an SMS message or an instant message. The assigned telephone number may be a toll free phone number without extension a local phone number with an extension a SIP URL etc. Alternatively the reference can be used to request the actual phone number of the advertiser.

In one embodiment the phone numbers of the target phones are not directly publicized over the media channels. Instead encoded target phone numbers are used. Using the encoded target phone numbers a user cannot reach target phones directly. The encoded target phone numbers allow the association of additional information with the target phone numbers such as the media channels used special promotions etc.

The encoded target phone numbers are delivered with content information e.g. web page WAP page short message television programs news articles virtual reality etc. to user devices such as user device A e.g. cellular phone user device B e.g. personal digital assistant PDA user device C e.g. computer user device D e.g. receiver user device E e.g. newspaper .

In one embodiment a user device can include a USB phone a Bluetooth wireless phone or one or more speakers or headphones with one or microphones for the implementation of a software based phone softphone .

In one embodiment the user devices phones support one or more real time communication capabilities such as VoIP using Session Initiation Protocol SIP which may support video and instant messaging applications IP phone regular phone over VoIP service Bluetooth wireless phone USB phone software based phone and other forms of IP telephony. In one embodiment the user devices phones support the display of virtual reality.

In one embodiment the user device can include a television set to receive the advertisement. Further the television set may have the capability to accept user input so that the television content may be changed according to the user input e.g. interactive television web television internet television etc. or be coupled with a set top box which has such capability. The user input may be provided to the content provider through the same communication channel in which the television content programs are delivered e.g. a cable system of a cable television system or a separate channel e.g. a phone line an Internet connection etc. . The user input may include a request to make a connection to an advertiser featured in an advertisement presented in a television program such as a request for a telephonic connection to the advertiser.

In one embodiment the user devices are mobile devices such as PDA cellular phone etc. The user devices obtain content information including advertisements through wireless communication connections such as cellular communication links wireless access points for wireless local area network etc.

In one embodiment a user device e.g. a cellular phone a computer a PDA can receive content information from multiple types of media channels e.g. a web server a WAP server an SMSC CHTML etc. .

In one embodiment a user device is capable to dial a phone call e.g. automatically according to the encoded phone number embedded in the content information when a user selects the number . Alternatively a user may manually dial a phone call using a separate phone such as user phone S or user phone T .

In one embodiment dialing at least a portion of an encoded target phone number connects the phone call to a connection server first. According to the encoded target phone number dialed the connection server determines the corresponding target phone number using the database and connects the phone call to the corresponding target phone e.g. one of target phones through the communication network .

Note the communication network may be circuit switched packet switched or partially circuit switched and partially packet switched. For example the telephone network may partially use the Internet to carry the phone call e.g. through VoIP . For example the connection between the user phone device and the connection server may be carried using VoIP and the connection between the connection server and the target phone may be carried using a land line based circuit switched telephone network.

In one embodiment the information associated with the encoded target phone number such as the media channel used to provide the encoded target phone number to the users is also decoded retrieved using the database . Thus the information associated with the encoded target phone number can be tracked stored.

In one embodiment the connection server also determines the phone number of the user through Automatic Number Identification ANI . ANI is a phone system feature that provides the billing phone number of the person making the phone call.

The information about the caller target phone number the media channel used for delivering the contact information to the user can be used to bill the caller and or the target phone number and provide credit compensation for the corresponding media channel.

For example the advertisements for target phone numbers can be paid for on a pay per call basis. Monitoring and tracking the calls can be used for billing the advertisers. Alternatively the users may be seeking the contact information on a pay per call basis. Monitoring and tracking the calls can be used for billing the users.

In one embodiment the additional information associated with the encoded target phone number is used to provide credit compensation to the operators of the corresponding media channels that are responsible for leading the users to the phone calls to the target phones. The system can further track the time and duration of the phone calls and other information such as conditional promotions electronic coupons etc.

The information about the media channels that are responsible for leading the users to the phone calls to the target phones can also be useful for the advertisers. The advertisers may wish to know which media channel is more effective in reaching users. For example using the statistic information about the media channels which successfully bring in phone calls the advertisers may fine tune advertisement strategies. Further different media channels may charge differently for the advertisements and the advertisers may bid differently on different media channels for their advertisements.

In one embodiment an encoded target phone number has the same number of digits as a standard phone number e.g. a typical telephone number assigned by a telephone company . Thus dialing the encoded target phone number is as easy as dialing the target phone number and dialing the target phone number reaches the connection server . In such an arrangement a large number of encoded phone numbers are generally required to differentiate the different target phones and different media channels.

In one embodiment an encoded target phone number has more digits than a standard phone number. A first portion of the encoded target phone number has the same number of digits as a standard phone number to reach the connection server through the communication network and a second portion of the encoded target phone number is to be decoded by the connection server . For example the Dual Tone Multi Frequency DTMF decoder can be installed in the connection server to detect the second portion of the encoded target phone number dialed at the user phone. The detected phone number can then be used to recover the target phone number. In one embodiment a human operator or an interactive voice response IVR system can be used to receive the second portion of the encoded target phone number for decoding.

When an encoded target phone number has more digits than a standard phone number the additional digits can be implemented as a telephone extension or as input to an IVR system. In one embodiment an encoded target phone number includes a Session Initiation Protocol SIP address for the initiation of a VoIP call to the system.

In one embodiment a single telephone number is used to reach the connection server for different target phone numbers and the portion of the encoded target phone number that is used to reach the connection server is not used in determining the information associated with the encoded target phone number.

Alternatively multiple telephone numbers can be used to reach the connection server and the entire encoded target phone number can be used to determine the information associated with the encoded target phone number.

In one embodiment the encoded target phone numbers can have different numbers of digits. The advertisers may be arranged to bid for shorter encoded target phone numbers.

In one embodiment the encoded target phone numbers are assigned only when needed for use in a media channel. For example when a query is received at the server of the system the system assigns phone numbers for the advertisements that satisfy the query.

In one embodiment a look up table approach is used to encode the information. For example the database keeps track of the information about the media channel and the target phone number and other information if any for the encoded target phone number so that the encoded target phone number can be used as a key to retrieve the corresponding information. Thus it is not necessary to have a predetermined structure to encode the information about the media channels and the target phone number.

Alternatively algorithms can be used to generate and encode target phone number and associated information. For example a predetermined algorithm may be used to encode different information in the target phone number. For example the target phone number may include a number of fields separated by or . Each of the fields can be decoded separately e.g. from a separate look up table or a mapping algorithm to determine the target phone number identity of the media channel etc.

For example a set of parameters can be mapped from a string of characters to a string of numerical digits as a part of the encoded target phone number and the string of numbers can be mapped back into the string of characters at the connection server . When such a mapping scheme is used a look up table is not necessary. For example an encoded target phone number may include a first portion that is the phone number of the connection server a second portion that is the target phone number appended with a number mapped from an identifier of the media channel. To prevent the user from dialing the target phone number directly an encryption scrambling scheme can be used to encode the second portion which is decoded at the connection server .

In one embodiment the connection server determines the target phone number from the encoded target phone number dialed by the user and then dials the target phone number for the user and joins bridges the phone calls so that the user can talk to the target phone.

In one embodiment users dial the encoded target phone numbers manually. A user can dial the encoded target phone number regardless of the user device used and the media channel used.

Alternatively in one embodiment user devices can automatically dial the encoded target phone numbers. For example a cellular phone a computer or a PDA can dial a phone number using a Dual Tone Multi Frequency DTMF generator. In one embodiment the encoded target phone numbers are presented in the content information in a format such that when the user selects the phone number the user device e.g. a cellular phone or a computer dials the encoded target phone number for the user. The user selection may be in the form of a keyboard keypad input a touch pad input a track ball input a mouse input a voice command etc.

In one embodiment the user device initiates the phone call through a VoIP system when the user selects the encoded target phone number.

In one embodiment the user device dials the phone number for the user without the user manually pressing the sequence of the encoded target phone numbers. This greatly simplifies the process of make the phone call. Since a user device can dial a long sequence of number easily a large number of digits can be used to encode the information without presenting any difficulties for the users.

In one embodiment the encoded target phone numbers are formatted so that the user device dials a first portion of the encoded target phone numbers to access the connection server pauses for a short period of time for the connection server to prepare for receiving the second portion of the encoded target phone numbers and then dials the second portion of the encoded target phone numbers. Thus the user device provides a user friendly way of dialing the encoded target phone numbers and making the phone call can be as easy as making a click to access a web page.

In the user device initiates the phone call. Alternatively a connection server may be used to initiate phone calls both to the user device or a separate user phone and the target phone and then join bridge the phone calls to connect the user to the target phone. For example when the user selects the encoded target phone number the selection of the target phone number is transmitted to the connection server with the user phone number.

The user phone number can be automatically determined through ANI or through a user preference setting or through an entry submitted with the selection of the encoded target phone number.

In one embodiment the selection of the encoded target phone number is transmitted to the corresponding media channel which forwards the request for making the phone call to a server e.g. a web server connected to the connection server. Alternatively the content information can be formatted so that the selection is sent directly to the connection server.

When the connection server starts the phone calls the encoded target phone number can also include alphabetic characters and or other characters . The connection server can decode the encoded target phone number to recover retrieve the target phone number and other associated information such as the identity of the media channel that is creditable for providing the encoded target phone number to user.

In one embodiment an advertisement is presented to end users around the globe without geographical area limitations. For example an advertiser may provide services and or products to customers around the globe. The advertisement may be delivered to the worldwide users of the Internet.

In one embodiment the intended audience of an advertisement is the population in a particular geographical area or people interested in a particular geographical area. For example an advertiser may limit its service area within a geographical area where the advertiser can provide services and or products to the customers more effectively. For example a business may better serve the customers within a convenient walking driving distance to the site of the business. A business may limit the service area within a city a county a state a country or other types of regional areas. Further a large business entity having offices around the world may want to attract customers in different geographical regions to different offices for better services.

In one embodiment a target geographic area is specified for publicizing a phone number which can be used to reach an advertiser. The target geographic area information can be used to effectively reach potential customers and connect the customers to the corresponding phones of the advertisers.

For example in one embodiment the advertiser can specify a geographic service area corresponding to a phone number. The service area may be specified in terms of radius city region state or national boundary etc. The service area can be used to limit the delivery of the advertisement to customers seeking information in the corresponding geographic area. The service area can be used to stream information into a mobile device when the mobile device enters the service area with or without explicit request from the user of the mobile device. The service area information can also be used to route the phone to the corresponding one of the offices of the advertiser based on the location of the caller if the advertiser has more than one office.

In one embodiment an advertisement presented in a media channel is for a single advertiser. The end user selects an advertiser according to the advertisements presented on behalf of individual advertisers and the connection server connects the end user and the selected advertiser according to the encoded target phone number individually publicized in the advertisement for the advertiser. When the user views the online advertisements the selection of the advertiser is based on the online information.

In one embodiment an advertisement is presented in a media channel for a group of advertisers such as a group of mortgage brokers. The advertisement contains an encoded target phone number which is reachable to the group of mortgage brokers. When the encoded target phone number is selected or used the selection of a particular advertiser is performed at the connection server.

For example a toll free number is published to advertise mortgage brokers in a particular geographic area. When a consumer dials the toll free number the call is routed to the highest bidding mortgage broker who is available in that market.

The connection server may select the target advertiser according to the bidding of the advertisers for the advertisement. The advertiser who places the highest bid is the winner for the call. Alternatively or in combination other types of selection criteria can also be used. For example the user may be interested in advertisers in a particular geographical region and the geographical area of interest to the caller can be determined and used in selecting the target advertiser. Further the user may be interested in a connection without excessive waiting time. The status of the availability of the advertisers to answer the call can be used in ranking the candidates for routing the call.

In general an indicator used to rank the candidates may be a function of a number of parameters such as the bid for the advertisement the projected waiting time an indicator showing a degree of matching to one or more user requirements e.g. geographic area service type etc. advertisement budget and others.

In one embodiment a connection provider uses a connection server configured on a packet switched network to provide telephone connections between callers e.g. customers and callees e.g. advertisers as illustrated in . In the connection server receives and or places telephone calls via the telecommunication carrier over the packet switched network . The telecommunication carrier further routes the telephone communications towards the caller and the callee .

Since the telecommunication carrier can route a call from a packet switched network to a variety of destinations e.g. a traditional analog telephone set a mobile phone a cellular phone a WiFi phone a Bluetooth phone a softphone running on a computer etc. the connection sever can use one type of communication connection with the telephone carrier to facilitate the communication connections with variety of devices used by the customers e.g. callers and callees . Thus the implementation of the connection server can be simplified. In one embodiment the connection server can also place and or receive direct VoIP calls to from the caller or callee .

For example to make a voice connection in response to a click to call request the connection server can place separate VoIP calls via the telecommunication carrier to the caller e.g. the requester of the click to call and the callee e.g. the destination of the click to call request .

If the caller or the callee is on a public switched telephone network PSTN the telecommunication carrier bridges the packet switched the network and the public switched telephone network PSTN . The telecommunication carrier routes the call from the packet switched network to the caller or the callee on the circuit switched network. Thus the caller or the callee can use a telephone set to receive the call via a Plain Old Telephone Service POTS . The connection server joins the separate calls that are placed via the packet switched network to connect the callee and the caller .

In one embodiment call signaling and media content may use different network paths. While call signaling is arranged to go through the packet switched network and the connection server the media stream does not have to go through the connection server . For example when the calls are joined the media content may be redirected to flow over the communication carrier without going through the packet switched network to the connection server for improved performance and efficiency. The connection server can release the control over the media stream to allow the media stream to flow through the shortest path without going through the connection server while maintaining control to the connection for the call by staying on the path for call signaling.

In another example when the caller initiates a call over a PSTN to the connection server the telecommunication carrier converts the call for the packet switched network for the connection server .

In one embodiment virtual softphones on the telecommunication carrier are assigned to the caller and the callee for interfacing with the connection server over the packet switched network . The virtual softphones encapsulates the devices and networks used by the caller and callee to access the connection server and the telecommunication carrier shields the connection server from the implementation details of the user devices and networks used by the caller and the callee . The connection server calls or receives calls from and connects the virtual softphones on the telecommunication carrier to connect the caller and the callee .

In the telephone connection between the telecommunication carrier and the connection server is facilitated via a packet switched network . Thus the connection server can operate efficiently in a digital domain. The connection server interfaces with the telecommunication carrier using one type of Internet Telephony systems e.g. SIP based Internet telephony .

Alternatively a connection server may include some or all of the functionality of the telecommunication carrier . For example the connection server may be configured to bridge a packet switched network and a circuit switched network. The connection server may support multiple different types of Internet Telephony systems.

In one embodiment the connection server and the telecommunication carrier are operated by different separate entities. Alternatively the connection server and the telecommunication carrier may be operated by the same entity. In another embodiment the telecommunication carrier includes a set of facilities operated by a number of separate entities.

In one embodiment the caller and or the callee may also place receive calls via a packet switched network. The telecommunication carrier may route the calls between the caller and the callee without using a PSTN. In one embodiment caller and or the callee may place calls to or receive calls from the connection server via Internet.

In one embodiment the session border controller is configured to control the signaling and media stream during the setting up conducting and tearing down of VoIP calls to or from the connection server . In some embodiments the session border controller may pick up the call that comes to the session border controller places a separate call from the session border controller and joins the received call and the placed call to control both the signaling and media stream. In some embodiments the session border controller may perform signaling encoding translation to allow the connection server to process the VoIP calls in one standard while receiving VoIP calls in a variety of standards e.g. SIP H.323 etc. . In one embodiment the session border controller is configured to perform one or more firewall functionalities such as denial of service protection call filtering bandwidth management etc.

In one embodiment the session border controller is configured to perform media releasing operation. When the session border controller determines that the source and destination of a media stream is on the same side of the session border controller e.g. both the source and the destination of the media stream is outside the connection server the session border controller can release the hairpinning of the media stream and allow the media stream to flow without going through the session border controller .

In a set of SIP servers e.g. . . . are networked to the session border controller to receive messages for incoming calls and to initiate outgoing calls. The session border controller is configured to evenly distribute the calls for processing by the SIP servers.

For example when an incoming message for the initiation of a call is received e.g. a SIP INVITE message from the telecommunication carrier the session border controller may route it to a SIP server e.g. for processing. The INVITE message includes the phone number dialed by the caller and the contact information about the caller e.g. the phone number of the caller and or the identity of the virtual SIP phone at the telecommunication carrier .

The SIP server may determine whether the phone number dialed by the caller is sufficient to determine the phone number of the callee e.g. . If the phone number of the callee e.g. can be determined from the phone number dialed by the caller e.g. via decoding the phone number dialed by the callee or looking up the phone number of the callee from a table using the phone number dialed by the caller as a key the SIP server can place a separate SIP call to the callee via the packet switched network and then connect the caller and the callee. Alternatively the SIP server can further route the SIP INVITE message e.g. to the telecommunication carrier to direct the call to the callee. For example the SIP server may modify the INVITE message by replacing the destination with the determined phone number of the callee. Further the SIP server can modify the INVITE message by removing the phone number of the caller or replacing the phone number of the caller with a phone number of the connection server . In one embodiment the modified INVITE message identifies the virtual softphone corresponding to the caller on the telecommunication carrier as the SIP phone initiated the call thus the virtual softphone corresponding to the callee on the telecommunication carrier can establish media connection with the virtual softphone corresponding to the caller on the telecommunication carrier directly. Alternatively the modified INVITE message may identify a media server or a virtual softphone on SIP server as the initiator for a separate call. The SIP server then connects the calls for the media stream.

In one embodiment the caller is first connected to a media server e.g. or . For example the SIP server may forward the SIP INVITE message to one or more of the media servers for answering the call. When a media server e.g. answers the call a prompt is played to the caller by the media server. The media server may include an Interactive Voice Response IVR system or be connected to an IVR system to obtain input from the caller.

For example the media server may prompt the caller to enter the extension assigned to the callee such that the phone number of the callee can be determined based on the phone number including the extension dialed by the caller. In some embodiments the extension dialed by the caller is sufficient to determine the phone number of the callee. After the phone number of the callee is determined the SIP server can further connect the call to the callee.

For example the media server can send a message to the SIP server. The message identifies the call and the extension obtained from the caller. The SIP server then determines the callee s phone number based at least on the extension received from the media server and initiates a SIP call via the packet switched network e.g. by sending a SIP INVITE message to the telecommunication carrier which further bridges the call to the callee . Then the SIP server disconnects the media server from the call and reconnects the call to the callee.

For example the SIP server can send a SIP BYE message to the media server to disconnect the media server from the call e.g. by sending a BYE message to the media server for the call and send a re INVITE message towards the caller to connect the caller and the callee. Alternatively the media server may send a SIP BYE message to the SIP server for the call the BYE message may include the extension obtained from the caller in response to the BYE message that contains the extension the SIP server determines the phone number of the callee and further connects the caller to the callee.

In one embodiment the SIP server can direct the caller and the callee to connect to each other for the media stream without having the media stream going through the session border controller into the connection server . For example the media stream can go through the telecommunication carrier in without going to the connection server after the SIP server connects the caller and the callee.

However the SIP server stays on the signaling path to monitor the progress and termination of the call. The SIP server can also break the connection between the caller and the callee or force the media stream to come through the connection serve . For example the SIP server may selectively conference a media server into the call to monitor and or record the communication of the call between the caller and the callee. For example the SIP server may reconnect the caller and the callee to separate media servers for interaction with an IVR system or a human operator to confirm a deal or transaction.

Similarly the SIP server may initiate a callback to a caller via a SIP call over the packet switched network for a connection to the caller. The SIP call may be bridged onto a circuit switched network e.g. by a telecommunication carrier . The SIP server can then reconnect the call to a media server for sending a prompt to the caller before reconnect the call to the callee. Alternatively the callback can be initiated from a media server and the call signaling e.g. the INVITE message from the media server goes through the SIP server for call control. Alternatively the SIP server sends out the INVITE message on behalf of the media server.

In one embodiment the SIP servers . . . and media servers . . . are implemented on separate computers connected via a local area network and or intranet or Internet . Alternatively at least the some of the servers can be implemented on a same computer. In one embodiment the SIP servers and the media servers are also integrated with the session border controller on a same data process system having multiple processors coupled with a data bus. In one embodiment the SIP servers are coupled to the media servers via a network and a SIP server may use any of the available media servers for interaction with the caller or callee . Alternatively a SIP server may be configured to use one or more of media servers that are not shared by other SIP server. For example a SIP server may be implemented on a same data processing system with one or more media servers which are reserved for the SIP server.

In one embodiment the connection server may further include a database server to storing records related to the calls data mapping between the communication references assigned to the callees and the actual phone numbers of the callees etc. In one embodiment contact mapping are cached in the local memory e.g. RAM of the servers for improved performance and the cached mapping is updated when the database is updated.

In the communication device is a form of a data processing system. The system includes an inter connect e.g. bus and system core logic which interconnects a microprocessor s and memory . The microprocessor is coupled to cache memory in the example of .

The inter connect interconnects the microprocessor s and the memory together and also interconnects them to a display controller and display device and to peripheral devices such as input output I O devices through an input output controller s . Typical I O devices include mice keyboards modems network interfaces printers scanners video cameras and other devices which are well known in the art.

The inter connect may include one or more buses connected to one another through various bridges controllers and or adapters. In one embodiment the I O controller includes a USB Universal Serial Bus adapter for controlling USB peripherals and or an IEEE 1394 bus adapter for controlling IEEE 1394 peripherals.

The memory may include ROM Read Only Memory and volatile RAM Random Access Memory and non volatile memory such as hard drive flash memory etc.

Volatile RAM is typically implemented as dynamic RAM DRAM which requires power continually in order to refresh or maintain the data in the memory. Non volatile memory is typically a magnetic hard drive a magnetic optical drive or an optical drive e.g. a DVD RAM or other type of memory system which maintains data even after power is removed from the system. The non volatile memory may also be a random access memory.

The non volatile memory can be a local device coupled directly to the rest of the components in the data processing system. A non volatile memory that is remote from the system such as a network storage device coupled to the data processing system through a network interface such as a modem or Ethernet interface can also be used.

In one embodiment a server data processing system as illustrated in is used as one of the communication server s connection server s database server s media server s controller s router s gateway s etc. In some embodiments one or more servers of the system can be replaced with the service of a peer to peer network of a plurality of data processing systems or a network of distributed computing system. The peer to peer network or a distributed computing system can be collectively viewed as a server data processing system.

A user terminal as a client system can be a data processing system similar to the system of . A client system can be in the form of a PDA a cellular phone a notebook computer or a personal desktop computer. For example the I O devices of the user device may include a USB phone a Bluetooth wireless phone or one or more speakers or headphones with one or microphones for the implementation of a software based phone.

In one embodiment a user devices phones support one or more real time communication capabilities such as VoIP using Session Initiation Protocol SIP which may support video and instant messaging applications IP phone regular phone over VoIP service Bluetooth wireless phone USB phone software based phone and other forms of IP telephony. Other types of traditional communication client s may be used in some embodiments.

In the interface allows the user to specify a time window in which the user is available for real time communications with the callee e.g. advertiser advisor seller etc. . The user can provide the one or more phone numbers of the user in the entry boxes e.g. . The user can select the control to request further fields for more callback references. In other embodiments the user can also provide other types of references for a real time communication such as a member name a user identifier an account number a screen name a telephonic reference such as a SIP URI a VoIP user ID an instant messaging user identifier etc. In one embodiment the user can specified a number of callback references of different types such as phone numbers with or without extension SIP URIs instant messaging user identifiers etc.

In one embodiment if the user has already signed in the callback references e.g. telephone number user ID etc. can be obtained automatically from the user account and filled in the entry boxes and for confirmation by the user. In one embodiment the user terminal e.g. a softphone a cellular phone etc. can automatically determine the one or more callback references of the user and the automatically determined callback reference can be used to pre fill the entry boxes and for confirmation by the user. Alternatively when the callback references can be determined via the automated process the system may initiate the connection process without displaying the interface as illustrated in .

In one embodiment when the callee is available for real time communications with the user the connection provider can call the phone number of the user to provide a connection between the user and the callee.

In one embodiment when the advertiser is available to talk to the customer the connection server can connect to the customer via multiple concurrent callbacks to the telephonic references of the customer. Thus the customer can take the callback to talk to the advertiser via any of the multiple telephonic apparatuses of the customer. The system may connect the first answered callback to the advertiser and drop the other callbacks or allow the customer to pick up more than one callback for a conference call.

In one embodiment the connection server can initiate multiple concurrent callbacks to the customer and multiple concurrent calls to the advertiser to connect the customer and the advertiser. In one embodiment the connection server receives a call from the customer and initiates concurrent calls to the advertiser to connect the customer to the advertiser. In one embodiment the connection server establishes a connection with the advertiser and then initiates multiple concurrent callbacks to the customer to connect the customer to the advertiser.

In one embodiment multiple concurrent calls are initiated from the user terminal of the customer or from the user terminal of the advertiser. The multiple concurrent calls may include one or more calls for peer to peer connections without going through a connection server.

In one embodiment multiple calls can be initiated in the user terminal of the customer or the user terminal of the entity of the listing. For example when a link or icon button in an advertisement displayed on the softphone or a mobile phone or smart of the customer is selected the softphone can be instructed to initiate multiple concurrent calls to the advertiser based on the multiple references embedded in the link or the icon button. In another example the advertiser is provided with a message to call back the customer and the message can include a link or icon button to cause the phone of the advertiser to initiate multiple concurrent callbacks to the customer. In one embodiment the phone is instructed to make connection with the first answered one of the concurrently placed calls. Alternatively the phone is instructed to establish a conference for all answered calls.

In one embodiment a reference to the user request is provided to the advertiser advisor to allow the advertiser advisor to initiate the connection with the user for real time communications. For example the system may send a message to the advertiser advisor including the reference to the user to inform the advertiser advisor that the user is interested in a callback within the time window specified by the user. The message can be sent via an email an instant message an SMS text message a voice mail a phone call etc.

In the user may further optionally provide a comment in the text field to get the attention of the advertiser advisor. In one embodiment the comment provided in the text field is sent to the callee e.g. advertiser advisor or seller with the notification of the request. For example when the callee is notified via a telephonic connection the comment can be provided via a text to speech module. For example when the callee is notified via a visual message the comment can be included as text.

In a visual interface is provided to a user to specify a callback number and a time window. Alternatively the user may call a phone number assigned to the seller to specify the callback numbers and the time window and to record a voice message for the seller. The phone number can be a phone number local to the user a toll free number e.g. 1 800 Call Bob a telephone number with an extension a SIP URI an instant messaging user identifier a VoIP user identifier a user identifier of a peer to peer voice communication network a member name a click to call reference a reference to a phone number an Internet address for a voice connection etc. When the phone number assigned to the seller is called by the user the call is connected to a connection provider which prompts the user to specify a callback number a time window a voice message if the seller is not immediately available to communicate with the user. In one embodiment the connection server automatically determines the number of the user e.g. via an automatic number identification ANI service and ask the user to confirm the use of the number as the callback number. Alternatively the callback number can be determined from the preference setting of the user after the user is authenticated over the phone connection.

In one embodiment the document is identified by the address specified in the entry box . The file at the location identified by the address may include links to other files at different addresses which are loaded into the browser as components of the document. Thus the file retrieved from the address specified in the entry box can be considered as the root file that provides instructions to dynamically assemble the document for presentation in the browser window .

The document presented in the web browser can include static content and or dynamic content. For example the document can include scripts or applets that dynamically generate content based on interactions with the user. The document may include multimedia streams e.g. a video or audio stream a static graphical image entry fields and or selection boxes etc.

The advisors may charge a fee for the service rendered over the communication connection established via the advertisement. In one embodiment the user may request an initially free connection with the advisor and after a period of time the advisor may request payment from the user.

For example when the user is connected to the advisor via a connection server e.g. via using the telephonic reference of the connection server assigned temporarily to the advisor to request the connection the advisor may request the connection server to charge the user on behalf of the advisor to continue the conversation after an initial free period of consultation. In one embodiment the user may be required to pre pay the advisor before being connected by the connection server to the advisor for a real time conversation in person.

For example the user may be connected to the advisor via a peer to peer network using a softphone or an instant messaging application which may be a standalone application or a built in or plug in module or an applet of a web browser. When a centralized server is not used in making the connection the user terminal such as the softphone or the instant messaging application can be configured to report the transaction to a centralized server for the payment processing or process the payment via the accounts maintained on the user terminals or to access accounts via the user terminals to process the payment.

Alternatively or in combination the advertisements presented in area may include the listings of an advertiser who offers similar products or services as the product or service presented in the area . Alternatively or in combination the advertisements may include the listings of an advertiser who offers products or services related to the product or service presented in the area in a way that user who are interested in the product or service presented in the area are likely interested in these related products or services.

In one embodiment the advertisements presented in the area include references assigned to the advertisers e.g. advisors sellers etc. . The assigned references can be used to request connections with the respective advertisers for real time communications.

In one embodiment an advertiser is charged an advertisement fee per a connection with a customer established via the advertisement for real time communications. In one embodiment an advertiser is charged a commission fee when the customer is charged for a transaction over the connection established via the advertisement. In one embodiment an advertiser is charged an advertisement fee per a presentation of the advertisement. In other embodiments a combination of fees can be collected for the advertisement or a subscription can be charged for the advertisement. Alternatively the advertisements can be presented without a charge.

In one embodiment an advertisement fee is charged for the advertisement or listing presented in the area or area when the user is connected to the advertiser for real time communication. The advertisement fee may be an amount specified by the advertiser or by the advertising system. In the embodiment the advertisement fee is determined based on a bid for maximum price specified by the advertiser and the closest bid of the competitor of the advertiser.

In one embodiment the operator of the web site is compensated per the connection established via the advertisement.

In one embodiment when an assigned reference is used to call for connections the user is connected to a connection server as an end point. The connection server determines the communication reference of the advertiser based on the assigned reference used to connect the user and the connection server and then further connects the user to the advertiser. Through the use of the assigned reference the connection server is in the path of connecting the user and the advertiser to track the connection made via the advertisement.

For example the assigned reference may be a telephone number of the connection server which when called by the user can be used to determine the telephone number of the advertiser and the telephone number of the advertiser can be used to further connect the call to the advertiser. For example the assigned reference may be a reference to request a callback to the user to connect to the advertiser. For example the assigned reference may be an identifier of the advertiser such as a user ID of the advertiser a SIP URL of the advertiser etc. The assigned reference can be passed to the connection server in a call signaling message of a VoIP call be used to request a server to resolve the reference into a direct reference for use in a network or be used to report to a server about the call to the advertiser.

In one embodiment the user terminals designed to make the connections via the advertisement can use the assigned reference to track the connection and report the connection to a server for the connection made via the advertisement. For example softphones can be designed to make direct connections over a peer to peer network without going through a centralized connection server. The softphones can be configured to report the calls made via the advertisements to a server for tracking. Alternatively the softphones may be configured to deduct fees or transfer funds via accounts maintained by the softphones or accounts accessible individually by the softphones.

Although illustrates various types of information presented in the document the disclosure is not limited to the specific combination illustrated in . More or less information or different types of information can be presented in the document. In some embodiments the documents are presented in the web browser in other embodiments the documents can be presented via other types of application programs such as a spreadsheet a word processor a document editor etc. In one embodiment the document is presented on an apparatus which has the capability to establish the connections for real time communications such as a softphone or a cellular phone or a PDA based phone.

In one embodiment some top positions in the list of search results are reserved for listings retrieved from certain sources e.g. address book and or the advertisement database . For example up to a first number of top positions can be reserved for the listings obtained from the personal address book and up to a second number of next top positions can be reserved for listings from the advertisement database and other listings can be mixed in the remaining positions of the list based on a ranking indicator such as the earning potential for presenting the listings the degree of matching to the search criteria availability of the callee to communicate in real time at the time of the presentation of the listings ratings of the customers the prices of the sellers etc.

In another embodiment the priorities of the different sources are represented by different weights for sorting the results in a unified way. For examples a ranking indicator may be evaluated based on a function of the earning potential the degree of matching to the search criteria and real time availability of the callee and or other considerations. To sort the listings from different sources in a unified way the earning potential the degree of matching to the search criteria real time availability of the callee and or other considerations can be modified with a weighting factor assigned according to the priority of the source of the listing before being used in the ranking function to compute the ranking indicator.

In another embodiment the list of search results are limited to a specific source. Alternatively listings from different sources can be presented in separated areas designated for the different sources.

In one embodiment when a listing is selected an expended entry is displayed for the listing. For example an expanded advisor entry shows a photo image of the advisor a description of the expertise of the advisor the rating based on the experience of prior activity of the advisor the price etc.

In one embodiment the expanded entry further includes an information icon which can be selected to provide a profile page about the advisor. For example the profile page may include the expertise of the advisor the rate a detailed description social connections and or previous consumer feedback information such as rating comments recommendations etc.

In the expanded entry includes a call icon which can be selected to initiate a call to the advisor. Alternatively the user can call the advisor via selecting the call now link of the listing or selecting the call button while the listing is being selected highlighted. In the telephonic reference of the advisor is not displayed in the listing and the user is encouraged to call via the telephonic apparatus. Alternatively the telephonic reference of the advisor can also be displayed for the listing and the user has the option to use a different telephonic apparatus to place the call.

In one embodiment the appearances of the call buttons or links are rendered based on whether the advisor seller or advertiser is currently scheduled to receive calls. If the call buttons or links are presented during a non callable time period of the callee such as when the current time is outside the scheduled hours for receiving calls or when the callee is currently off calls the appearances of the call buttons or links are rendered to indicate that the callee is not currently available for real time communications and the call buttons or links cannot be activated to call the callee. When the callee is not currently available for real time communications the call buttons or links can be activated to schedule an appointment or request a callback.

In the user interface contains entry fields for specifying the information an advertiser wants to appear on the advertisement. For example the business name field is to receive the name of the advertiser which can be used to identify the advertiser in the database and in the advertisement.

The address city state country and zip fields and are to receive the location information about the advertiser. The location is typically a site where a potential customer may visit to obtain services and or products.

The phone field is to receive the telephone number at which the advertiser is to receive phone calls from potential customers. In one embodiment the phone number of the advertiser in the phone field is not shown directly to the end users. An encoded substitute phone number is used in the advertisement so that when the encoded phone number is called the phone number of the advertiser is determined and connected to. This allows the tracking of phone calls generated from various advertisements for different advertisers and or generated through different advertisement delivery channels.

The web site URL field is to optionally receive a home web page address of the advertiser. In one embodiment the advertisement is generated to contain a link to the web page as specified in the web site URL field so that if the end user wants further details about the advertiser the end user may click the link to visit the web page of the advertiser. In one embodiment the advertiser is not charged for the link directing the web user to the web page of the advertiser. Alternatively the advertiser may be charged for the link that is clicked to lead the web user to the web page of the advertiser. In one embodiment the amount the advertiser is charged for the click is automatically computed from the pay per call price according to the click through rate and call through rate so that the average click through revenue and the average call through revenue is about the same.

In one embodiment the advertisement is not to include a link to the web site URL . The web site URL is used to obtain further information about the business of the advertiser so that the advertisement can be placed in relevant media channels.

For example the web pages at the web site according to the web site URL can be fetched and analyzed automatically to determine topics categories keywords content etc. so that the placement of the advertisement can be based at least partially on the topics categories keywords content etc. to increase the chances of the advertisement being of interest to the targeted users.

The tag line field and the description field are to receive one or more concise statements about the business offering the unique ways of meeting customers needs how the business stand out from the competition etc. In one embodiment the information in the description field is presented in a text form. In one embodiment the text in the description field can be enhanced with boldface and italic type as well as formatting using a Rich Text Editor as supported by Internet Explorer for Windows or Mozilla Browsers e.g. Firefox Netscape etc. .

In one embodiment further optional information such as a logo an electronic coupon etc. not shown in can be specified for the advertisement. In one embodiment to provide an electronic coupon one can simply specify a coupon headline description and expiration date if any . The coupon information is then store in the database and presented with the advertisement.

In one embodiment an advertiser can further specify a price bid for advertisement logo advertisement budget e.g. in terms of the number calls per day monthly spending limit etc. targeted geographic area s of customers business categories key terms etc.

In one embodiment a user interface can be displayed to edit or view information collected by the network for the supply affiliate such as advertisement performance e.g. call through rate total number of calls generated in a given time period total charges advertisement spending rewards for the affiliate from the advertiser etc. .

In a set of featured listings are presented on top of other listings to advertise the featured listings. The sellers of the featured listings may or may not offer a separate advertisement fee for featuring the listings. A value formula is used to compute the value scores of listings that are qualified to be featured e.g. having a user rating above 3.5 and current availability for a connection with the customer for real time communications .

For example the value scores of the qualified listings can be evaluated to rank the candidates. A predetermined number of top ranking listings can be selected as the featured listings. The featured listings are presented according to the value scores while the other listings may be presented according to a different order based on the rate the rating availability name or topic etc. A presented listing may also include an icon image e.g. supplied by the seller advertiser.

In one embodiment when the seller advertiser is available for real time communications an icon button e.g. is also presented for the listing. The customer user can use a cursor to select the icon button to request a connection to the seller advertiser for real time communications such as a telephone conversation a text voice and or voice chat and or an application sharing session e.g. screen sharing common white boarding etc. .

In one embodiment when the seller advertiser is not currently available for real time communications an icon button not shown in can be displayed which when selected causes the browser to provide an interface for arranging an appointment for a call to the seller advertiser.

In one embodiment when the icon image of the seller advertiser or the link or is selected clicked the browser displays detailed information about the listing. When the rating is selected selected feedbacks from prior customers of the listing is displayed. A selection of any of the links embedded in the listing can be a click which can be qualified as a chargeable event for advertisement fee e.g. a fee for featuring the advertisement . Example conditions for qualifying the click include the customer having provided payment information e.g. a credit card number a debit card number a checking account number a debit account number etc. the customer having not clicked more than a predetermined number of listings within a period of time the customer having not made a purchase from the seller advertiser within a period of time the customer having not made a click on the listing within a period of time etc. Some of the conditions may be satisfied or verified after the click some of the conditions may be satisfied or verified before the click.

In one embodiment a seller advertiser may not offer an advertiser fee separate from the predetermined commission fees charged by the connection provider for transactions made via the communication connections provided by the connection provider. However when the value score of such a listing is high enough the connection provider may also present such a listing as a featured listing.

In one embodiment the seller advertiser may specify a bid price for preferential placement in featured listings. The listing management tool may display the bids of competitors to assist the seller advertiser in determining a bid price for the advertisement fee. However since the selection and placement of featured listings are based on the combination of the customer spending the bid price and the conversion rate it is not easy for the seller advertiser to determine a bid price based on the bid prices of the competitors.

In one embodiment a listing management tool can determine the competitor listings that can be qualified as featured listings determine the value scores of the competitors and determine the actual bid that are required for the listing to have a value score ranked above the competitors. For example the top list of value scores of the competitors can be converted into a list of actual bids for the listing to win various positions in featured listings. The actual bids can be provided to help the seller advertiser in determining a price bid for getting the listing presented as a featured listing. In one embodiment a seller advertiser can place a maximum bid for a specific position in featured listings.

In one embodiment a seller can budget advertisement spending based on revenue incomes generated. For example the seller can allocate a percentage of the transaction revenue for preferential placement in featured listings to attract new customers e.g. 10 of earned revenues . Thus as the listing generates more incoming based on the connections established by the connection provider via the listings the connection provider can automatically adjust the advertisement budget of the listing.

In one embodiment the connection provider collects statistic data and presents the marketing acquisition costs. For example since the advertisement fee is charged after the payment information from the customer is identified the advertisement fee can be associated with the identity of the customer. When a call to the seller advertiser is initiated from the customer the connection provider may provide the seller advertiser with the information about advertisement fees that have been paid to acquire this customer and the information about past spending of the customer on the listing. When there are more than one callers waiting in the line the seller advertiser may use such information to prioritize the queue of callers.

In one embodiment the listing management tool also allows the seller to specify a budget limit for advertising to an individual customer. After a certain amount of advertisement fee has been paid to acquire the customer e.g. 10 and or a ratio between the accumulated advertisement fee spent on the customer and accumulated spending of the customer on the listing is above a threshold value 20 the listing may not be presented as a featured listing to the customer.

In one embodiment the customer is required to accept the price of the seller before being connected to the seller for real time communications between the customer and the seller. Alternatively the customer can be connected to the seller for an initial free time period. The seller can request payment after talking to the customer for a period of time and once the customer accepts the price of the seller the system can charge the customer on behalf of the seller and compensate the seller accordingly.

In one embodiment an advertiser is charged differently for different types of leads e.g. phone call email instant messaging video conferencing etc. . An advertisement may be presented in a combination of different channels and a lead generated from an advertisement may include connections for a combination of different types of media e.g. text audio video etc. .

In one embodiment the communication that is responsive to the advertisement is transmitted from the customer to the advertiser via the communication gateway . Since the communication request is made via the reference the communication gateway can look up advertiser s contact info from the database based on the reference to facilitate the transmission of the communication to the advertiser . Alternatively the reference may include an encoded or encrypted version of the advertiser s contact info which can be decoded or decrypted without having to perform lookup from a database.

In one embodiment the reference is at least part of a phone number e.g. a toll free number a local number a phone extension a SIP URI Universal Resource Identifier a VoIP address etc. which can be used to request a phone connection. In other embodiments the reference may be a portion of a parameter for an HTML link which can be selected to request the arrangement of a communication with the advertiser a portion of an email for requesting a communication with the advertiser via email a portion of an instant messaging identifier for requesting a communication with the advertiser via instant messaging etc. In one embodiment multiple references are provided in the advertisement to allow the customer to select a communication media for reaching the advertiser .

In one embodiment a communication lead includes the delivery of the communication from the customer to the advertiser . When the communication is delivered from a distinct customer to the advertiser the communication lead is considered being delivered to the advertiser and the advertiser can be charged a fee for the advertisement e.g. according to a price bid on communication lead .

In one embodiment a communication lead includes a communication connection provided to facilitate the communication between the customer and the advertiser . In one embodiment when the communication connection is readily available to the advertiser the communication lead is considered being delivered to the advertiser and the advertiser can be charged a fee for the advertisement e.g. according to a price bid on communication lead . For example after the connection between the communication gateway and the customer is established and the advertiser is contacted for the completion of the connection between the communication gateway and the advertiser the communication connection between the customer and the advertiser can be considered being readily available to the advertiser . In another embodiment a communication lead is considered being delivered to the advertiser after the communication connection is established between the customer and the advertiser .

In one embodiment a connection for transmitting and receiving communications in real time is provided to facilitate the communication between the customer and the advertiser . The connection may support full duplex voice communication video communication and or text communication.

In one embodiment the transmitting of the communication from the customer and the receiving of the communication at the advertiser may not be in real time. The communication may be stored or queued and then forwarded to or retrieved by the advertiser . In one embodiment no connection is provided to support full duplex real time communication and the delivery of the initial communication from the customer is considered as the communication lead.

In one embodiment the advertisement is charged for based on the delivery of a lead to a customer who has sufficient interest in the advertisement to initiate a request for an in person communication with the advertiser. Such a customer is more interested in the advertisement than a person who is simply browsing for information. Such leads can be more valuable than forwarding a web visitor to a web site of the customer.

In one embodiment the customer makes the request for an in person communication via a communication channel that is typically used for in person communications such as a real time communication that supports voice. For example the customer may request a phone connection with the advertiser . For example the customer may request an instant messaging session with the advertiser . For example the customer may request for a video conference session or a shared application session e.g. common whiteboarding . For example the customer may request to send an email instant message voice mail video mail SMS message web mail etc. to contact the advertiser .

In one embodiment the customer makes the request for an in person communication via providing information that is specific to the customer and that is typically not apparent to a web site that is being visited. The provided information may or may not be forward to the advertiser .

For example the customer may provide the customer s contact information to request that the customer be contacted by the advertiser via the communication gateway . The customer s contact information may be used by the communication gateway to establish a connection between the customer and the communication gateway or be provided to the advertiser who may then initiate the connection directly with the customer . The customer s contact information may be used by the communication gateway in receiving the initial communication from the customer and or in delivering the initial communication to the advertiser .

For example the customer can provide the phone number of the customer to request the communication gateway to establish a phone connection with the advertiser without providing the phone number of the customer to the advertiser . For example the customer can provide an email address to request communications with the advertiser via email without revealing the email address to the advertiser . For example the customer may provide a postal address to request communications via postal services. For example the customer may send an appointment request a product service request a purchase order etc. to the advertiser in the initial communication to the advertiser . Alternatively the customer may provide the phone number email address or the postal address to the advertiser via the communication gateway such that the advertiser can subsequently contact the customer without the communication gateway .

In one embodiment the customer is verified as being a person before the communication gateway allows a communication flow between the customer and the advertiser . For example a human operator may talk to the customer to receive the customer s request and determine whether the communication is from a person. For example the customer may be required to provide person verification information so that the communication gateway can determine whether the communication request is indeed from a viable customer. In one embodiment the customer is required to be authenticated as a registered member of the system. In one embodiment the communication gateway uses Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart CAPTCHA to make a determination on whether there is a human behind the communication request. In one embodiment a CAPTCHA test is designed such that most human users can pass the test but it is very difficult to design a software program to pass the test. Since the system made the attempt to verify that there is a viable customer behind the communication request the lead is valuable to the advertiser .

In one embodiment the customer makes the request for an in person communication via a communication in a form that is typically used for in person communication such as voice communication. For example the communication may include audio video image and and text messages.

In one embodiment the customer makes the request for an in person communication via particularly requesting a communication contact of the advertiser. For example a hidden portion of a communication reference is revealed when a request from the customer is received and the user interface is specifically designed to allow the user to specifically request the communication reference such that a majority of users would perform the action to request the communication reference only when specifically interested in the initiation of the communication with the advertiser. For example a graphical user interface button or link may be designed to state click here to see the phone number of this advertiser .

In one embodiment the information provided by the customer in making the request for an in person communication with the advertiser is used by the communication gateway to forward responsive communications obtained from the advertiser to the customer .

In one embodiment the information provided by the customer is provided to the advertiser without expecting an in person response from the advertiser . For example a purchase order an appointment or reservation request can be sent to the advertiser without an in person reply from the advertiser . For example the communication gateway can use the data collected from the customer e.g. via a web page to file a request with the advertiser and the request can be filed by the communication gateway on behalf of the customer via a web form a voice message an email or an application program interface etc.

In one embodiment the communication channel used between the communication gateway and the customer has the same type as the communication channel used between the communication gateway and the advertiser . The communications are relayed forwarded by the communication gateway . Alternatively the communication gateway may perform format conversion and thus the communication channel used by the customer to provide the communications to the communication gateway may not be the same as the communication channel the communication gateway used to provide the communication to the advertiser . For example the communication gateway may receive a requesting communication via a web page and transmit the request to the advertiser via instant messaging voice mail email a phone call etc.

A communication channel used for the delivery of the communication lead may be phone email instant messaging voice mail video mail SMS message web mail and or other known types of communication channels.

One embodiment of the disclosure provides a pay per deal advertisement process in which advertisers pay an advertising network when a communication lead e.g. a phone call delivered by the advertising network results in a deal for the advertiser. A deal may be related to acquisition purchase exchange auction survey delivery of a message obtain an answer etc. In a deal an acquisition or purchase may be made by the advertiser or by the customer for digital and or physical goods and or for advice entertainment amusement information or services delivered over the communication connection of the communication lead and or offline etc.

In one embodiment the deal can be defined by the advertiser based on the purpose of the advertisement. For example the advertiser may define an event that indicates the close of the deal for the advertisement. The system can then provide the advertisement and detect the occurrence of the event to charge the advertisement fee when the advertisement results in a deal as defined by the advertiser.

In one embodiment the advertisement fee is charged when the pre identified agreement between the customer and the advertiser is reached as the result of the advertisement. Thus the advertisement fee correlates with the desired result of the advertisement as defined by the advertiser reducing or eliminating the uncertainty for the advertiser investing in the advertisement. In one embodiment an interface is provided to an advertiser to facilitate the selecting or defining what the advertiser considers as a deal to be achieved via the advertisement and the system monitors or detects the completion of the deal or transaction to charge for the advertisement fee.

In one embodiment advertisements are presented to generate communication leads and allow the advertisers to close the deals via the communication leads. Various types of communication leads described above can be used. In one embodiment a communication connection between a customer and an advertiser is provided via a connection provider to deliver and track the communication lead and the communication connection is also provided to facilitate the communications needed to close the deal.

For example a communication lead can be a phone call received via a dynamic number generated and displayed in an advertisement on websites search results banners etc. In one embodiment the phone connection is provided to facilitate the discussion between the customer and the advertiser to reach a deal and the advertiser is charged for the advertisement when the customer and the advertiser reach a deal via the phone connection. In one embodiment the advertiser is not charged a fee for the communication lead if there is no deal after the communication between the customer and the advertiser. In another example a communication lead and connection is provided via a phone call received using a softphone software phone and the call results from a customer selecting a click to call icon of an advertisement presented in websites search results etc. A phone lead and connection can be provided via a phone call received at a phone number that is assigned to the advertiser advertisement and presented in a media channel such as a static or dynamic billboard Yellow Pages magazine newspaper television radio broadcasting etc. The phone lead may be received via a directory assistance call. The communication lead and connection for real time communications can also be provided via instant messaging for communications in text voice audio and or video. The communication lead and the connection may also be provided via non real time communications such as voice mail email SMS etc.

The advertisement fee that is to be paid for each deal can be a fixed price offered by the advertising network a share of revenue received by the advertiser or a percentage of the payment made by the advertiser to the customer and or a specific lump sum bid price specified by the advertiser.

In one embodiment the advertisement fee is to be charged for a deal in addition to a separate advertisement fee for the communication lead and or other fees. Alternatively the advertiser is charged the advertisement fee for the deal and not charged a separate fee for the communication lead. For example when there is no deal following a communication lead the advertiser is not charged for the communication lead and thus the advertiser is not charged for the leads that do not result in deals.

In one embodiment a deal is arranged to be concluded or processed via the communication connection provided via the advertisement. For example the payment or the delivery of the goods service or information can be made via a communication over the communication connection provided via the advertisement and the system can monitor the provided communication connection to detect the deal.

In another embodiment the deal can be reached outside the communication connection provided via the advertisement. However at least a portion of the deal is carried out via the system such that the system can tracked the completion of the deal to bill for the advertisement fee. For example the system may facilitate the payment processing delivering of goods or services and or the book keeping of records e.g. via communications through an Application Programming Interface API provided by the system . The system can correlate the deal made via the system and the communication connection provided via the advertisement to charge the advertisement fees for deals that have been made with the help of the communication connections provided via the advertisement.

For example the customer can be identified via a communication reference of the customer used in the communication lead. For example the telephone number of the customer can be identified e.g. via an ANI service or as the callback number provided by the customer and the telephone number of the customer can be used in a system e.g. a Customer Relationship Management CRM system that handles the transactions between the customer and the advertiser to identify the deals that are the result of the phone connections provided via the advertisement. For example the Internet Protocol IP address of the customer can be used to correlate the communication connection e.g. IP telephony or instant messaging provided as a response to the advertisement and the deal made between the customer and the advertiser.

In one embodiment after the communication connection is provided between the customer and the advertiser a user interface is provided to the customer to carry out a transaction between the customer and the advertiser and the user interface includes a reference to the communication connection to track the deal made via the communication connection.

Alternatively the advertisement fee can be charged for a deal without having to check whether there is a communication connection provided for the deal. In one embodiment a separate fee is charged if it cannot be determined whether a communication connection has been provided to assist the deal.

In one embodiment a data communication channel is provided by the system to facilitate the conclusion of the deal while the customer and the advertiser communicate over the real time communication connection. For example when a customer calls an advertiser via the connection provider a user interface is provided on the softphone of the customer or a web browser to receive input from the customer. In one embodiment the connection provider receives the user interface from the advertiser relays the user interface to the customer obtains the customer s input to the user interface and relays the input to the user interface of the advertiser. In one embodiment the connection provider provides an interface to the customer to complete the required actions for the deal and presents a mirrored version of the interface to the advertiser to assist the advertiser in communication with the customer. For example the advertiser can walk the customer through the user interface and provide answers to questions raised by the customer to complete the required actions over the user interface e.g. filling out a purchase order form or a survey form or placing a bid on an item offered by the customer etc. .

Since the data communication channel is provided with the real time communication connection a deal detected in the data communication channel can be attributed to the provision of the real time communication connection that is a result of the advertisement.

In one embodiment after a real time communication connection is provided as a result of the advertisement a user interface provided to the same customer for a transaction between the customer and the advertiser is modified to include a reference to the real time communication connection. Thus the deals concluded as a result of the real time communication connection provided via the advertisement can be tracked.

In one embodiment an arrangement is made to allow an advertiser to report a deal in the real time communication connection provided via the advertisement or via a separate data connection. For example in the phone connection to the customer made via the advertisement the advertiser can dial a sequence e.g. or 76 to indicate that there is a deal resulting from the communication lead. Alternatively the advertiser can visit a web page to view recent phone calls received via the advertisement and mark the phone calls that resulted in deals. The advertiser may visit the web pages periodically after the phone leads or mark the phone calls while the conversations resulting from the phone leads are in progress.

In one embodiment the advertiser pays a subscription fee to receive communication leads a fee based on the duration of the communication connections and or a separate advertisement fee for the deal when the deal is completed.

In the connection provider bridges the communications between the advertiser and the customer . The connection provider can monitor the communications to facilitate the transaction between the advertiser and the customer . For example the connection provider can provide the communications to a transaction handler which performances the transaction on behalf of the customer and or the advertiser based on the communications between the advertiser and the customer .

For example the advertisement may present an offer from the advertiser to sell an item or service. Since the communication reference can be used to request a voice connection to the advertiser via the connection provider the customer can request a voice connection to talk to the advertiser regarding the offer. After talking to the advertiser the customer may decide to accept the offer. The customer can be instructed to provide a signal over the voice connection to indicate the acceptance of the offer. For example the customer can press a key e.g. or dial a sequence e.g. 11 to indicate the acceptance or provide a voice command e.g. accept or deal after a voice prompt is provided by the transaction handler via the connection provider to the customer . The transaction handler is configured to carry out the requests or deals made over the communication connection provided by the connection provider .

In a deal detector is coupled to the transaction handler to detect a deal that is made via the communication connection provided by the connection provider as a result of the advertisement . When there is a deal the advertiser is charged an advertisement fee for the advertisement .

In one embodiment when there is no deal the advertiser is not charged an advertisement fee for the advertisement . For example the connection provider may charge the advertiser for a communication service fee for the cost of the communication session between the customer and the advertiser regardless the result of the communication. The communication service fee may be based on the duration of the communication and or the locations of the advertiser and the customer . Alternatively the communication service fee may be a monthly subscription fee or a flat fee per communication session or a flat fee per communication session having a duration less than a predetermined time limit e.g. 3 minutes or 10 minutes . When there is a deal the advertiser is further charged an advertisement fee according to a bid price of the advertiser or a flat fee price offered by the advertising network.

Alternatively the communication service fee may be waived and the advertising network may cover the communication cost using the advertisement revenue.

In one embodiment the connection provider includes a telecommunication service provider. The telecommunication service provider and the advertising network may share the advertisement income and or the communication service fee.

For example in one embodiment the telecommunication service provider may charge the customer and or the advertiser for a communication service fee for the connection made via the telecommunication service. The advertisement can be presented to allow the customer to particularly request the telecommunication service provide to provide the connection for the real time communications between the advertiser and the customer . The advertising network and the telecommunication service provider can then share the revenue by compensating the advertisement network using a portion of the communication service fees resulted from the advertisements.

For example when the advertisement is displayed on a mobile device of the customer e.g. a cellular phone the advertisement can be presented in a format which allows the customer to click on a link or icon to dial a number via the mobile device e.g. the cellular phone such that the phone call is made through a cellular communication network. For example the advertisement can be presented in a format which allows the customer to click on a link or icon to request the telecommunication service provider to call back the customer for a connection to the advertiser . For example the advertisement may present a telephone number dynamically assigned by the telecommunication service provider to the advertisement so that when the customer call the dynamically assigned telephone number the telecommunication service provider further connects the phone call to the advertiser .

Alternatively the advertising network and the telecommunication service provider can share the revenue by compensating the telecommunication service provider using a portion of the advertisement fees resulted from the advertisements. For example the telecommunication service provider may charge neither the customer nor the advertiser directly. Instead the telecommunication service provider may charge the advertising network for the communication service or the advertising network provides a percentage of the advertisement fee to the telecommunication service provider.

In one embodiment the telecommunication service provider charges the customer and or the advertiser for a communication service fee and the advertising network charges the advertiser an advertisement fee. The advertising network compensates the telecommunication service provider by providing a portion of the advertisement fee to the telecommunication service provider and the telecommunication service provider provides a portion of the communication service fee to the advertising network to compensate the advertising network for leading the customer to the services of the telecommunication service provider.

In one embodiment the communication service fee is not charged and the advertisement fee collected from the advertiser is shared between the telecommunication service provider and the advertising network. In another embodiment the advertisement fee is not charged and the communication service fee collected from the customer and or the advertiser is shared between the telecommunication service provider and the advertising network.

In one embodiment the advertising network may instruct the telecommunication service provider to charge the advertisement fee. In one embodiment the advertising network may instruct the telecommunication service provider to charge and or credit the advertiser and or the customer for the transaction made over the communication connection between the advertiser and the customer . In one embodiment the telecommunication service provider charges or credit the advertiser and the customer via credit card accounts or other types of electronic payment methods . In one embodiment the telecommunication service provider charges the advertisement fee via the telephone bill of the advertiser .

In the transaction between the advertiser and the customer is facilitated via the transaction handler . For example the transaction handler may be configured to process payment from the customer to the advertiser for purchases made by the customer to process payment from the advertiser to the customer for acquisition made by the advertiser to process delivery of goods information etc. The customer and or the advertiser can be instructed or guided to provide instructions to the transaction handler over the communication connections provided via the connection provider .

For example the transaction handler may include an interactive voice response system which may include business processing logic for conducting the transaction. When the advertiser and the customer reach an agreement the advertiser and or the customer may request the transaction handler to capture the agreement. For example if the customer is ready to make the purchase the advertiser may request the transaction handle to take over the conversation with the customer confirm the purchase price and payment information and conclude the deal. For example if the customer is ready to visit the advertiser the advertiser may request the transaction handler to present a direction to the business location of the advertiser .

Alternatively or in combination the advertiser may be instructed to provide an indication of a deal to or via the connection provider whenever the advertiser gets a deal from the communication connection provided by the connection provider .

In one embodiment the advice entertainment information purchased or acquired in the deal is delivered via the communication channel provided by the connection provider. Alternatively the purchased or acquired goods and or services can be delivered without going through the connection provider and or the transaction handler .

In one embodiment the advertisement is delivered to the customer before a communication connection between the connection provider and the customer is established and the customer requests the communication connection between the connection provider and the customer via the advertisement . For example the customer may perform a search on a mobile device using a web browser a WAP application or an SMS message or an instant message and the advertisement is provided with the search result. For example the customer may enter or leave an geographic region e.g. a commercial district or the vicinity of a business and in response to a determination of the position of the customer e.g. via a GPS unit or a cellular position determination system the mobile device carried with the customer can receive an advertisement that is location sensitive.

In one embodiment the advertisement is delivered to the customer over the communication connection between the connection provider and the customer . For example the connection provider may also provide directory assistance service and the advertisement may be provided in response to a directory assistance request received from the customer over the communication connection between the connection provider and the customer . For example the advertisement may be provided in an audio format to the customer over the phone connection or in a visual format to the customer s devices that is also capable to receive data such as a cellular phone a smart phone a PDA a portable computer etc.

In one embodiment the directory assistance provider is an entity separate from the connection provider and the directory assistance provider forwards or bridges the connection to the connection provider for a connection to the advertiser if the customer responses to the advertisement .

In the data connection goes through the transaction handler which can monitor the data communications for the detection of a deal. An advertisement fee can be charged where a deal is detected.

For example the transaction handler may provide an application programming interface to facilitate the exchange of data between the transaction handler and the advertiser . For example when the customer requests the voice connection to the advertiser the transaction handler can determine the advertisement to which the customer is responding and present information identifying the advertisement and or information related to the customer e.g. whether the customer is a repeated customer statistics of prior purchases prior calls etc. . In one embodiment the transaction handler can further facilitates electronic commerce and presents the items to be sold via the advertisement to the advertiser to facilitate the voice communication with the customer. With the help of the voice communication connection with the customer the advertiser can take the purchase order from the customer and conclude a deal.

In one embodiment while the advertiser is filling the purchase order the transaction handler can also present the relevant order data to the customer via the data connection between the transaction handler and the customer . When the deal is ready the customer can be asked to confirm the deal via the data connection or via the voice connection . Further during the process of filling the purchase order the customer may also provide input via the data connection to directly modify or specify the purchase order.

For example an application sharing session may be provided via the data connection to allow both the advertiser and the customer to walk through a common user interface to reach a deal.

In some embodiments the data connection is provided between the advertiser and the transaction handler but not to the customer . In some embodiments the data connection is provided between the customer and the transaction handler but not to the advertiser . In one embodiment different types of data connections are provided to the advertiser and to the customer and the transaction handler provides data information to the advertiser and or to the customer based on pre determined rules.

In one embodiment the data connections are provided to facilitate the deal while voice communication connection between the advertiser and the customer is maintained. The data connection and the voice connection are maintained concurrently. Alternatively the voice connection and the data connection may be provided in a way that is partially overlapping in time or in a way that has no overlapping in time. For example the data connection may be provided when the customer and or the advertiser requests for the data connection. In one embodiment when the data connection is provided the customer and or the advertiser is asked to identify the voice connection e.g. based on time of the voice connection a reference number provided in the voice communication channel and or an identification of the advertisement etc. Once the voice connection is identified the context of the voice communication can be used to set up the data presentation in the data connection and the deal detected by the deal detector in the data connection can be attributed to the voice communication connection.

Alternatively the data connection may be derived from the voice connection. For example when the voice connection is provided via softphone or instant messaging session the data connection can be added based on the voice connection. Alternatively the voice connection may be derived from the data connection. For example during the processing of conducting business transaction via the data connection the customer may feel the need for a voice communication and thus requests the voice connection.

In one embodiment when the customer requests the data connection the association relation between the voice connection and the data connection can be automatically identified based on the identity of the customer the identity of the advertiser and or the identity of the advertisement.

In one embodiment the data channel between the customer and the connection provider and or the data channel between the advertiser and the connection provider may be the same or different ones of web WAP SMS email instant messaging and a custom application protocol.

For example when the connection provider detects that the communication device e.g. a mobile phone such as a cellular phone has the data communication capability e.g. web WAP SMS instant messaging etc. the connection provider can present a visual user interface to the customer over the data connection to guide the customer through the transaction and or the confirmation of the deal between the customer and the advertiser . For example the connection provider can send an SMS message to the cellular phone of the customer to request a confirmation of the agreement made between the customer and the advertiser and the confirmation may be provided by the customer via a replying SMS message to the connection provider .

In the connection provider generates a connection record which may include identification information of the customer e.g. the IP address of the customer the phone number of the customer a user name of the customer a credit card number of the customer etc. identification information of the advertiser e.g. the advertisement for which the customer called the phone number of the advertiser an ID of the advertiser etc. the starting and ending time of the connection etc. When the customer interacts with the transaction handler the transaction handler determines information about the transaction such as identification information of the customer and identification information of the advertiser advertisement. The information collected for the transaction can be matched against the connection record by the deal detector to determine whether the transaction is helped by any communication connections provided via the advertisement. In one embodiment the matching process is further based on the time window of the transaction. For example if there is overlap in time between the communication connection provided via the advertisement and the transaction the communication connection may be credited for the deal. For example if the transaction is performed before the expiration of a time window following the communication connection the communication connection can be credited for the deal.

In the advertiser may define the deal event as the customer agrees to pay . For example the system may provide payment processing for the advertiser. When the advertiser and the customer reaches an agreement over a phone connection the advertiser can hand over the connection to the IVR system to process payment and the IVR system may ask the customer for the payment information such a credit card number a bank account a member ID etc. and as the customer to confirm the acceptance of the charge. If the customer accepts the charge the deal event the customer agrees to pay occurs and the advertiser can be charged an advertisement fee for the deal delivered via the advertisement and or the communication connection.

Alternatively the advertiser may specify that the deal event occurs when the customer places an order or the customer places a bid.

In one embodiment the advertiser may specify that the deal event occurs when the customer visits a web page at an URL specified by the advertiser. The system may present a link e.g. in the advertisement or in a web page presented to guide the customer through the connection process and or the business transaction related to the advertisement to direct the customer to the web page specified by the advertiser. Alternatively the system may require the advertiser to place a code in the web page at the specified URL to allow the tracking of the visits to the URL. For example the code may include a link to the server of the system which when receives a request made via the link forwards the link to the original server of the web page. For example in response to a user selection interaction the code may make a remote procedure call to a server of the system to report the user selection interaction.

In one embodiment the advertiser may specify that the deal event occurs when the customer presses the submit button in the web page at the URL. The system can request the advertiser replaces a submit button provided by the system to allow the tracking of the customer selection of the submit button. For example the submit button provided by the system can visit the web server of the system to report the selection of the customer and then forward data submitted with the selection of the submit button to the advertiser. In one embodiment the system can provide an application programming interface to forward the data to the advertiser. In another embodiment the web server redirects the web request resulting from the selection of the submit button to an URL specified by the advertiser e.g. the original target URL of submit button of the web page .

In one embodiment in response to the advertiser specifying the deal event as the customer pressing the submit button in the web page the system may visit the web page the URL specified by the advertiser determine the target URL of the submit button of the web page and provide a replacement submit button to replace the submit button in the web page the URL specified by the advertiser.

In one embodiment the advertiser may specify that the deal event occurs when the customer agrees to provide an address to the advertiser. For example the system can collect the address information from the customers when the address of the customer is needed to close the deal the system may prompt the customer to authorize the release of the customer s address information to the advertiser. When the customer agrees to release his her address the system detects a deal in response to the deal the system can charge the advertiser a fee for the advertisement.

In one embodiment the advertiser may specify that the deal event occurs when the customer agrees to provide answers to certain question e.g. an advertisement for a survey . For example the system may conduct the survey on behalf of the advertiser while allowing the advertiser to supervise monitor or assist the survey process via the communication connection between the customer and the advertiser. The system closes a deal when the customer provides answers to a set of questions specified by the advertiser.

In one embodiment the advertiser can specify that the deal event occurs when the advertiser is satisfied and dial a sequence specified by the advertiser to indicate there is a deal.

In one embodiment when the advertiser specifies the deal event the system arranges the detection of the deal event such that the advertisement can be charged according to the deals detected according to the deal event defined by the advertiser. In one embodiment the system is designed to have the capability to detect a variety of events and the advertiser can select one types of events or a combination of events as the deal event.

In one embodiment the options for the definition of deal events can be offered based on the types of advertisements or the category of advertisements and or the services provided by the system to assist the business transaction. For example an advertisement may involve an auction an acquisition selling physical goods or digital goods etc. Different types categories of advertisements may be offered different choices for defining what the advertiser deems as a deal.

In one embodiment the advertiser can group deals for the payment of advertisement fees. For example the advertiser may offer to pay a subscription fee of a pre defined amount per month under the condition that the system delivers at least a pre defined number of deals via the advertisement. In one embodiment the advertiser may specify subscription fees for a number different levels of deal amounts realized via the advertisement and the system charges the subscription based on the actual level of deal amounts. For example the advertiser may specify a first subscription when the deals resulting from the advertisement is below a first number a second subscription when the deals resulting from the advertisement is between the first number and a second number etc. In one embodiment the advertiser may offer a basic subscription to the advertising network and an additional amount for deals achieved in a given increment e.g. each deal or each ten deals or each dozen of deal etc. .

In one embodiment the advertiser may specify the price for the advertisement fee as a maximum bid price and the system can automatically determine the actual bid price based on the bid prices of the competitors of the advertiser.

In one embodiment the advertiser may specify the price for the advertisement fee as a function of a bid price of the customer for the information service digital or physical products or ownership interest offered by the advertiser. For example the advertiser can offer information service digital or physical goods for sell via an auction and the advertisement may be used to provide communication connections for communications between the advertiser and customers. When the auction is closed the advertisement fee may be determined based on the largest bid price of the customers who have placed bids via the advertisement or via the communication connections provided through the advertisement . Alternatively the advertisement fee can be determined based on the winning bid independent of whether the winning bid is placed via a communication connection provided through the advertisement. Alternatively or in combination the advertisement fee may also be charged for each distinct bid or the highest bid from each distinct customer received via the communication connection provided through the advertisement. In one embodiment the advertisement fee can also be a function of the number of bids received over the communication connections provided via the advertisement the level of the bid prices and or the quantities purchased by the customer. The function may be a continuous function or a discontinuous function on a sliding scale. For example an advertisement fee may be specified as 1.00 if the winning bid is above 10 but less then 20 and 2.00 if the winning bid is above 20. For example an advertisement may be used to advertise the auction of a stock and the advertisement fee can be different depending upon the amount of the bid for each share the number of shares involved in the transaction etc. In one embodiment other conditions for the transaction can also be included in the computation of the advertisement fee such as whether the purchase is in blocks or odd lots etc.

In one embodiment the chargeable event for a performance based advertisement is not a single type of predetermined events. The chargeable event for an advertisement presented to a customer is dynamically determined selected from a set of different predetermined events based on the actual progress achieved.

For example an advertisement can be presented with a click to call button a click to reveal button and or a link to a web page of the advertiser or a web page presenting the advertiser or a product of the advertiser . When the advertisement is selected e.g. clicked but not called through to the advertiser the advertisement can be treated as a pay per click advertisement when the advertisement is called through the advertisement can be treated as a pay per call advertisement and the clicks leading to the call are not separately charged for. When a deal is reached the advertisement is treated as a pay per deal advertisement and the clicks and calls leading to the deal are not separately charged for. Alternatively the clicks the calls and or the deals can be treated as separate events qualified for separate charges.

In one embodiment the presentation of an advertisement initiates a customer acquisition process for the advertiser. The advertisement can have one or more predefined goals in the customer acquisition process such as selling a package of service or product obtaining a bid on an auction item obtaining answers to questions selling information entertainment amusement etc. Multiple anticipated events between the presentation of an advertisement and the goal s of the advertisement are tracked as the progress indicators of the customer acquisition process. The advertisement can be charged for according to the actual progress level achieved based on the tracked events. The closer the progress to the goal s of the advertisement the more the advertisement can be charged for.

In one embodiment the progress is tracked for a particular customer and or for a particular time period. For example an advertisement may be presented to a customer multiple times within a time period e.g. an hour a day or a week . The customer acquisition process targeting this particular customer may reach some progress levels multiple times within the particular time period. The highest progress level achieved within the particular time period can be identified for the process targeting this particular customer and the advertisement can be charged for based on the highest progress level achieved. Thus the advertiser is not charged multiple times for lower progress levels achieved within the particular time period in the customer acquisition process targeting this particular customer and the advertiser is not charged multiple times for the highest progress level achieved within the particular time period in the customer acquisition process targeting this particular customer.

In one embodiment the highest achieved progress level is not charged for multiple times within a particular time period if the highest progress level achieved in relation with the particular customer is not the highest possible progress level. For example when the highest possible progress level is a purchase deal multiple calls from a customer to the advertiser resulting are counted as one if the calls received within a time window e.g. an hour a day or a week do not result in a purchase deal when there are multiple purchase deals resulting from multiple calls within the time window the advertiser can be charged multiple times for the purchase deals. Alternatively the multiple purchase deals with the customer within the time window may also be counted as one chargeable event.

In one embodiment a set of configurable rules are used to determine chargeable events that can be waived in view of other chargeable events. Some chargeable events can be waived in view of prior chargeable events and some chargeable events can be waived in view of subsequent chargeable events.

In one embodiment the advertisement fee corresponding to the highest progress level achieved in the customer acquisition process targeting this particular customer is charged incrementally as the customer acquisition process reaches various levels within the particular time period. Alternatively the highest achieved progress level is determined after the expiration of the time period or when the highest possible level is achieved and then the advertisement fee is charged according to the price associated with the determined progress level.

In the presentation of the advertisement is arranged to lead to different levels of communications e.g. . . . and to the transaction . When the customer requests for the first level communication such as a web page of the advertiser or a web page of a connection provider presented on behalf of the advertiser the advertisement achieves a progress level for which the advertisement can be charged for according to price A. When the customer further requests for the second level communication such as a phone call with the advertiser the advertisement achieves a progress level for which the advertisement can be charged for according to price B which is typically higher then price A. When the customer requests for the transaction the advertisement achieves a progress level for which the advertisement can be charged for according to price X which is typically higher then price B.

In one embodiment the different levels of communications e.g. . . . leading toward the transaction are arranged to occur sequentially according to a single predetermined path. For example the advertisement can be presented in a telephonic apparatus that is configured to allow the user to select a link embedded in the advertisement to visit a web page presented on behalf of the advertiser. The web page contains a link which when selected causes the telephonic apparatus to initiate a call to the advertiser or to send a message to a connection provider to request for a callback to the telephonic apparatus for a connection to the advertiser . During the phone conversation the telephonic apparatus presents a user interface to allow the user to accept a payment request from the advertiser for a purchase.

Alternatively there may be multiple paths from the presentation of the advertisement to the transaction . For example the first level communication e.g. a web page may also include a user interface to allow the user to make the purchase without going through the second level communication e.g. a phone call . For example after the phone conversation the user may revisit the web page and make a purchase request via the web page directly. In another example after viewing the web page the user may revisit the advertisement and make a phone call directly based on a telephonic reference provided in the advertisement without again requesting the web page.

In one embodiment the hierarchy of chargeable events used as process indicators is defined according to the desirability of the events in reaching the goals of the advertisers. Alternatively the hierarchy of chargeable events can be determined based on the prices associated with the chargeable events. In some embodiments the hierarchy of chargeable events can be structured based on the designed or anticipated flow sequence of events.

In one embodiment some of the communications can be initiated concurrently. For example the selection of the advertisement may cause the telephonic apparatus of the user to display the web page and initiate a call to the advertiser. Alternatively the web page can be displayed with a user interface to request a callback to the user.

In one embodiment the user terminals used by the customers and or the advertisers are configured to track the progress. In another embodiment the progress is tracked via dynamically assigning communication references which can be used on general purpose user terminals to request the communication connections and via monitoring the communications over the connections.

For example after the advertisement is requested by the user the advertisement is provided to the user with an embedded link to a web page. The link includes a parameter identifying the user such as an IP address of the user a phone number of the user and or a user identifier etc. The telephonic reference presented in the web page and or the advertisement can be associated with or constructed to include the same parameter identifying the user. Thus the phone call initiated with the telephonic reference can be associated with the selection of the link via the parameter identifying the user. When the transaction is at least partially via the communication over the telephonic connection the transaction can be associated with the user. When the transaction is via the web page the link to submit the transaction request can also include the parameter to identify the user.

In one example an advertisement can be presented with a user interface to request different levels of communications. For example the advertisement can be selected by a customer to request further information such as a web page an electronic brochure a text document a multimedia document etc. The information provided via the advertisement can be presented with a further user interface element selectable to request text based real time communication such as text chat or instant messaging. A text chat or instant messaging session can further lead to a voice and or video chat or a telephonic conversation. For example a telephonic reference can be provided via the text chat or instant messaging session. Alternatively the text chat or instant messaging session can be upgraded to a voice communication session. Real time communications can lead to a desired transaction between the customer and the advertiser.

In one embodiment the performance process of the advertisement can be identified through monitoring the occurrences of events such as the selection of the advertisement by the customer to request further information the connection for the text based real time communication the connection for voice based real time communication and the desired transaction.

In one embodiments the events may occur when the customer is using different user terminals. For example a selection of an advertisement may occur when the customer is viewing the advertisement on a web browser running on a computer and the customer may use a telephone set separate from the computer for a telephone conversation with the advertiser. The events can be associated with the customer via assigning the links and the telephonic references that are specific to the customer.

Alternatively the hierarchy of the milestones is predetermined and the advertiser is not allowed to specify a lower price for a higher level milestone. For example a per call price cannot be lower than a per click price and a per deal price cannot be lower than a per call price. In one embodiment the advertiser can choose to use some of the milestone but not the other milestones. For example the advertiser may offer a per click price and a per deal price without a per call price or offer a per click price and a per call price without a per deal price or offer a per call price and a per deal price without a per click price.

In one embodiment the advertiser can further select the link to specify conditions for the qualified click. For example the advertiser may require that a qualified click include a selection of a link to an advertiser s web site a selection of a link to a detailed description of the offer of the advertiser a selection of a link to sign into a user account and or a selection of a link to provide payment information etc. The advertiser may require that the qualified click be from a user who has not been a customer of the advertiser for at least a period of time. In one embodiment the advertiser can also specify the time window within which multiple clicks are counted as one. Alternatively some of the parameters can be specified by the system.

In one embodiment the advertiser can further select the link to specify conditions for the qualified call. For example the advertise may require that a qualified call include a call for text chat a call for instant messaging session and or a telephone call etc. The advertiser may require that the qualified call be from a user who has not been a customer of the advertiser for at least a period of time. In one embodiment the advertiser can also specify the time window within which multiple calls are counted as one. Alternatively some of the parameters can be specified by the system.

In one embodiment the advertiser can further select the link to define a deal event. For example an interface shown in can be presented to define a deal by the advertiser in response to the selection of the link .

In one embodiment the presentation module is configured to present to a user a listing retrieved from the server or from a peer to peer network over the communication network . In one embodiment the listing includes a communication reference which can be selected on the user terminal to request a connection to a user terminal e.g. for communications with the entity of the listing e.g. advertiser seller advisor etc. and or to request other information related to the entity.

In one embodiment the communication module can make a peer to peer connection to the user terminal via the communication reference provided in the listing. For example the communication reference provided in the listing may include an encrypted reference to connect to the user terminal B such as the user identifier of the callee a telephone number of the callee a session initiation protocol universal resource identifier of the callee etc. The communication module is configured to decrypt the reference and make a connection to the user terminal via a peer to peer network. For example the communication module may query the peer to peer network or the server to determine the presence of the callee on the user terminal according to the decrypted user ID of the callee and then initiate a connection with the user terminal .

In one embodiment the communication module initiates the connection in accordance with the callable schedule of the callee. For example the communication module can be configured to query whether the current time instance is within the callable schedule of the callee and the connection is not initiated if the current time instance is outside the callable time period of the callee. In one embodiment the peer to peer network or the server is configured to provide the presence information of the callee being on the user terminal when the current time instance is within the callable schedule of the callee. When the current time instance is outside the callable schedule the user terminal is not provided with the presence information that can be used to call for the connection even when the callee is online on the user terminal .

In one embodiment the accounting module is used to maintain the account information. For example when the user activates the user terminal or when the user signs into the member account of the user the account information can be initialized or loaded into the accounting module .

In one embodiment the accounting modules of the user telephonic apparatus can perform transactions or record the transactions for subsequent updating in a centralized account database. In another embodiment the account information of the members is maintained on a peer to peer network with or without the help of a centralized account server.

For example in one embodiment the user terminal used by the customer maintains the member account of the customer via the accounting module and the user terminal used by the seller or advertiser maintains the member account of the seller or advertiser via a corresponding accounting module. The user terminal of the customer pays the user terminal of the seller via the peer to peer communication connection between the user terminal of the customer and the user terminal of the seller. The user terminal of the advertiser can be instructed to deduct an advertisement fee from the account maintained on the user terminal of the advertiser in response to a chargeable event reported from the user terminal of the customer.

In one embodiment during or after the communications between the customer and the seller the user terminal of the customer and or the user terminal can make a connection to a server of a service provider to provide a commission fee for the transaction to the service provider. In another embodiment the commission fee is provided to the service provider via deduction of a portion of the balance maintained by the accounting modules.

In one embodiment a member account indicates the balances the member has through pre paying the connection provider service provider. The balance may be in the unit of minutes for telecommunications e.g. telephonic communication instant messaging communications etc. in the unit of a currency e.g. U.S. Dollar or in the unit of points etc. In one embodiment the processing of the payment charged by the seller is in the form of transferring the member balance from one member account to another member account e.g. via a peer to peer network or a centralized server . In one embodiment a member account is maintained on a user terminal such as a computer a PDA or a telephonic apparatus e.g. a softphone or a cellular phone a WiFi phone or a PDA based phone . In one embodiment the member account can be dynamically transferred from being hosted on one user terminal to another terminal via a peer to peer network or a centralized server.

In one embodiment the processing of collecting commission fee is in the form of deducting a portion of the balance from a member account or transferring from a member account to an account of the service provider. In one embodiment records of the transactions are stored by the accounting modules to bill or credit the members via their telecommunication bills e.g. telephone bills cellular phone bills etc. 

For example the accounting module of the user terminal of the customer is configured to monitor the progress of the customer acquisition process on the user terminal and to report the dynamically identified chargeable event to the user terminal of the advertiser which is configured to deduct the advertisement fee based on the dynamically identified chargeable event reported by the user terminal . Alternatively the accounting module of the user terminal is configured to report various detected events to the accounting module of the user terminal which is configured to determine the actual chargeable event for the advertisement. Alternatively an accounting module implemented on the server can be used to determine the actual chargeable event for the advertisement based on the events reported from the user terminal and or the user terminal .

In one embodiment a user terminal e.g. is configured to communicate with a financial institution to facility the transaction. For example one user terminal may be configured to access a bank account of the member to make or receive payments and another user terminal may be configured to make or receive payments via a credit card account a debit card account etc. The user terminals connected via a peer to peer connection may not use the same financial institution. In one embodiment the user terminals are configured to use their respective associated financial accounts to automatically process the payment after both the seller and the customer agree on the payment request.

In one embodiment a connection server charges or pays the customers and or advertisers advisors sellers service providers etc. via bank accounts credit card accounts debit card accounts member accounts etc. after authenticating the identities of the customers and or the advertisers advisors sellers service providers etc. for providing the connections for real time communications.

In one embodiment when the user signs off from the user terminal the account information is transferred to the server which allows the user to sign in from a different user terminal to access the service. In one embodiment a user can explicitly request the user terminal to transfer the balance to the server or to another user terminal.

In one embodiment the accounting module periodically reports the account information to the server . In one embodiment account information is reported with details about various potentially chargeable events such as the calls for connections e.g. call detail records selection of links activation of icon buttons etc.

In one embodiment when a user requests for a listing the peer to peer network or the server can determine whether the user terminal used by the user is capable of making a peer to peer connection and tracking the account information. When the user terminal has the capability the user terminal is provided with the listing embedded with a version of the communication reference of the callee and the listing is selectable to initiate the peer to peer connection without going through the server . When the user terminal does not have the capability the user terminal is provided with the listing embedded with a communication reference of the server to allow the user terminal to request the server to provide a connection with the callee. When the user terminal does not have the communication module to make the real time communication connection the user terminal can be presented with a reference of the server for a call for connection via a separate user terminal or a reference to request a callback from the server .

In one embodiment when the communication module fails to make a peer to peer connection with the user terminal of the callee e.g. when the peer to peer network determines that the callee is not currently on line the communication module is configured to request the server to provide a connection with the callee. For example when the softphone of the customer failed to connected to the softphone of the advisor the softphone of the customer can call the server which determines a landline phone of the advisor and connect the customer to the advisor on the landline phone.

Thus depending on the capabilities of the user terminals of the user and the callee the server may dynamically get involved in the connection process and or in the process of tracking the events milestones and or account balances. The user and the callee of the listing can use a variety of user terminals to access and deliver the services such as user terminals that are implemented with only a subset of functionalities of the modules of user terminal or conventional user terminals.

In one embodiment when a user terminal of the caller or the callee partially or entirely lacks the functionalities to make the peer to peer connection and or track the account information and milestones the communication references presented in the listings are dynamically adjusted according to the capability of the user terminal to bring the server or a peer to peer network into the communication path to add the functionality as a system. For example a server may act as a portion of the communication module of the user terminal and or as a portion of the accounting module of the user terminal. For example the link may have an address pointing to the server which when receives the request forwards the request to a destination address. For example the user terminal of the caller can communicate with the server to establish a connection with the user terminal of the callee and the server can initiate a session for the connection with the user terminal of the callee and provide a virtual accounting module for the user terminal in the session after authenticating the caller. For example a caller can use a plain old telephone set POTS to call the server which connects the caller to an IVR system or a human operator to authenticate the caller track the usage of the caller and make a peer to peer connection to the user terminal of the callee or call the callee on a PSTN network .

In one embodiment at the time the listing is being requested for presentation to the user the server or the peer to peer network can provide the communication reference based on a determination of whether the user terminal of the user and the user terminal of the callee can make a peer to peer connection and track the communications and milestones.

For example if both the user terminal of the user and the user terminal of the callee have the peer to peer communication module and the accounting module the user terminal can be provided with the communication reference of the callee for a peer to peer connection without going through a centralized server. The accounting module of the user can deduct an amount of balance from the account of the user maintained on the user terminal of the user and the accounting module of the callee can add an amount of balance to the account of the callee maintained on the user terminal of the callee.

For example if both the user terminal of the user and the user terminal of the callee have the communication module to make a peer to peer connection but one of the user terminals lacks the accounting module the communication reference can be assigned to cause the accounting module to report the activity to the server . Thus the system can operate in a way as if the missing account module were on the server .

For example when the user terminal of the user has an accounting module and the user terminal of the callee does not have an accounting module the accounting module can cause the communication module to report the communication session to the server which credits to the account of the callee based on the communication duration over the peer to peer connection between the callee and the user as reported by the user terminal of the user.

For example when the user terminal of the user does not have an accounting module and the user terminal of the callee has an accounting module the user terminal of the callee can communicate with the server to identify the user to monitor the communications and track the progress and or to reduce the balance of the account of the user for purchases.

For example when neither the user terminal of the user nor the user terminal of the callee has an accounting module the user terminal of the callee can be provided with a VoIP communication reference which when used to set up a call causes the call signaling messages to go through the server to allow the server to identify the caller to provide the connection based on the callable schedule of the callee and or to track the communications and service the accounts of the user and the callee. For example the communication reference can be provided with an embedded identifier of the caller after the caller is authenticated. Alternative or in combination the caller can be authenticated after the caller initiates the call.

In one embodiment the connection for real time communications with the entity is to be established via the data presented after the user selecting the listing and the deal is to be made via the real time communications over the connection between the user and the entity.

In one embodiment to establish the connection for real time communications with the entity the user may place a call to a connection provider for a connection for real time communications with the entity or receive a callback from a connection provider for a connection for real time communications with the entity or establish a peer to peer connection for real time communications with the entity without going through a centralized connection provider. For example the connection can be established for telephonic conversation for chat in text voice or video for screen sharing for application sharing or for virtual reality experience with the entity.

In one embodiment the predetermined events are to occur sequentially one after another and a latest event that is responsive to the presentation of the listing is determined as the identified event for charging the fee. In one embodiment the fee is charged according to a set of prices received from the entity for the set of predetermined events respectively.

In one embodiment the entity is incrementally charged according to the set of prices in response to a plurality of events up to the latest event. For example in response to one of the events the system determines whether the current event has a price higher than a previously charged event. If the current event has a price higher than the previously charged event the charge for the previous event is waived and the advertisement is charged for according to the price of the current event. If the current event has a price lower than the previously charged event the charge for the current event can be waived. In one embodiment the event is dynamically identified after the presentation of the listing.

In one embodiment a set of prices are associated with the set of predetermined events respectively and a highest priced event that occurred in response to a presentation of the listing to the user is selected from the set of predetermined events as the identified chargeable event.

In one embodiment a charge to the entity is waived when a gap between the identified event and a prior charged event is within a predetermined period where the prior charged event may be responsive to a prior presentation of the listing to the user.

In one embodiment the listing includes a reference selectable to request a callback for a real time communication connection with the entity and the set of predetermined events includes selecting the reference to request the callback accepting the callback and accepting a payment request from the entity over the real time communication connection. In one embodiment the communication system charges the user on behalf of the entity responsive to the user accepting the payment request.

In one embodiment the listing further includes a telephonic reference such as a telephone number without an extension a telephone number with an extension a session initiation protocol SIP uniform resource identifier URI a user identifier of an instant messaging network or a voice over Internet Protocol VoIP user identifier and the set of predetermined events further includes initiating a telephone call using the telephonic reference.

In one embodiment the listing further includes a link to a web site of the entity and the set of predetermined events further includes selecting the link.

In one embodiment the listing is presented on a telephonic apparatus of the user and the set of predetermined events includes selecting a link embedded in the listing to request a document for presentation on the telephonic apparatus of the user and requesting a peer to peer connection to a telephonic apparatus of the user via the listing. In one embodiment the telephonic apparatus of the user is further configured to transfer an amount to the telephonic apparatus of the entity in response to the user accepting a payment request made via the telephonic apparatus of the entity.

From this description it will be appreciated that certain aspects are embodied in the user devices certain aspects are embodied in the server systems and certain aspects are embodied in a system as a whole.
