title: Anti-drip sandwich bag
abstract: A bag made of water resistant paper or plastic for holding a “goopy” sandwich such as a hamburger, hot dog, etc while eating the same is fitted on the open end with a collar extending generally radially from the bag. The collar or drip plate is adapted to catch liquids, slurries, and small particles falling from the sandwich. The catchings are either retained on the collar or directed back into the bag where they either soak into the sandwich or run to the bottom of the bag. In either case, the drippings do not fall onto the diner, table, or floor.

Food containers namely paper or plastic carrying and serving bags for transporting and then holding the food during eating.

A paper bag is fitted with a surrounding tray to catch drips of mayonnaise catsup meat and vegetable juices particles of food and the like.

Restaurants and fast food vendors usually wrap their goods mainly hamburgers in a sheet of paper or shallow waterproof bag. These provide sanitary coverings for holding the food but if the food is drippy with mayonnaise catsup tomato juices etc material can drip from the food and not be caught within the wrap or bag. The present invention recognized the need for more containment of these common problems to keep both the eater the table and the floor of the restaurant clean.

The literature in the US patent files shows several deep bags for carrying sandwich like food and the sandwich may be pushed to the top to be exposed and positioned for eating. However these have no advantage over the more common shallow bag or wrap during eating.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 964 534 by Theodore Wells is an improvement over the more common food bag or wrap. Mr. Wells includes a surplus of material at the top that can be folded back and extend somewhat from the hamburger or sandwich. The folds are comprised of soft flexible material and do not prevent liquids and slurries from escaping. Indeed the skirt formed by folding parts of the bag film outwardly are described as directing drips into the bag or away from the user over his hand. The drips directed into the bag are not retained by the shielding skirt and the drips directed away are not retained but allowed to drip off the shield skirt. The present invention can retain the drips or permit them to be controllably poured off of the retainer.

It is an object of the invention to provide controlled capture of food drips and droppings from a hamburger hot dog sandwich or similar finger food.

It is another object of the invention to retain the drips and droppings on a drip tray integral with a carrying holding bag.

It is another object of the invention to permit controlled removal or dumping of the retained drips from the drip tray.

A bag made of water resistant paper or plastic for holding a goopy sandwich such as a hamburger hot dog etc while eating the same is fitted on the open end with a collar extending generally radially from the bag. The collar or drip plate is adapted to catch liquids slurries and small particles falling from the sandwich. The catchings are either retained on the collar or directed back into the bag where they either soak into the sandwich or run to the bottom of the bag. In either case the drippings do not fall onto the diner table or floor.

Referring to The invention depicted as is shown holding an exemplary sandwich in this case an hamburger . A bag that is sufficiently large generally tubular in form having a closed bottom and water and grease resistant is adapted to encase the expected type of sandwich is topped with a collar generally extending from the bag opening. The collar has sufficient stiffness and water resistance to catch and hold any liquid slurry or particles that might drip from the sandwich. The outer rim of collar has an upward extending ring to prevent the drippings from falling off the collar.

Referring to Collar and the associated bag opening is sculpted to fit the expected type of sandwich. In particular an oval for sandwiched served in a hamburger type bun approximately round for hot dogs and submarine sandwiches and approximately rectangular for sliced bread sandwiches.

Referring to The collar serving as a drip tray with upturned rim ring may be radial from the bag opening as shown in detail a or slanted upwardly as shown in detail b or downwardly as shown in detail c . The upturned rim ring is shown as a retro curve but other shapes such as a straight vertical wall a wall with a beaded edge for strength a straight wall set at an acute angle with the collar will also work. A rim ring wall set at an obtuse angle will work but may more easily be overtopped when the collar is tipped unless the ring wall is quite large. The choice is made by considering functional characteristics and manufacturing processes.

When the collar is squeezed slightly and is bent downward creating a valley the upturned edge will tend to flatten into a pouring lip and the caught drippings will run to the valley to be in position to be poured out of the collar drip tray.

Embodiment a can be folded flat against the bag for boxing for distribution to the food industry. Embodiments b and c can also be folded but will take up more room within a shipping box.

Embodiment b causes the drippings to run back into the bag and or be absorbed into the sandwich. Embodiment c retains the drippings at the edge the upturn may be larger than that of the other two embodiments and can hold more. However the diner must use care not to tip the collar too much and cause the catchings to overflow the retaining ring.

The bag can be attached to the collar tray by any of several means. The whole bag collar assembly can be molded in one piece or a bag element can be glued or welded to the collar in a second operation. That allows the bag and collar to be fabricated and optionally printed separately. The bag may be attached to the flat portion of the collar or the collar may have a short downward or upward tubular section to which the bag is secured. The bag may be long enough to surround the sandwich serving as a closed carrying device from the dispensing counter to the dining table or transport vehicle. Alternatively the bag may be as short as one half the sandwich length and the sandwich will then be served in ready to eat position.

The preferred materials are plastic or plastsized paper. One piece molded plastic can provide sufficient strength and water proofness to perform as intended and can be easily mass produced. Papers having suitable characteristic are well known available and biodegradable but will require more fabrication steps.

The anti drip sandwich bag is unpacked from the shipping container opened and a prepared sandwich inserted. The sandwich may be inserted totally for carrying and delivery or partly ready to eat. The diner holds the sandwich with the collar in an approximately horizontal attitude and proceeds to eat it pushing the sandwich upward as needed. The drippings may be poured out as needed or allowed to be re absorbed into the sandwich. When finished the bag is folded around the collar and discarded.

The foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention. Further since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described and accordingly all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to as falling within the scope of the invention as defined by the claims which follow.

The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property right or privilege is claimed are defined as follows
