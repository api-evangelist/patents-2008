This system includes an optical sensor, a light emitter, a light detector and a signal analyzer. The sensor is continuously disposed on (or integrated to) the assembly at a position on the path and has initial and terminus ends. The light emitter transmits an optical signal from the initial end. The light detector receives the optical signal from either the initial or terminus ends. The signal analyzer compares the optical signal from the detector to a quantifiable deflection of the assembly launcher. The signal analyzer issues an alarm indication in response to the quantifiable deflection exceeds a hazard-condition threshold. The sensor may be positioned either substantially parallel to or transverse at discrete points along the path and be disposed longitudinally along and/or wrapped helically around the launcher barrel.

The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy and thus the invention herein may be manufactured used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention relates generally to monitoring systems for electromagnetic launcher axial components and more particularly to such configurations that preferably can provide continuous condition measurements of launcher barrels from launching a projectile at high speed. Such conditions for measuring include dynamic deformation temperature strain and humidity.

An electromagnetic launcher e.g. barrel accelerator utilizes electromagnetic force to propel an electrically conductive payload. Electrically conductive rails may be disposed in a longitudinal launch direction from breech to muzzle ends of the launcher. Electric current flowing through the rails induces a magnetic field that produces a mutual repulsion Lorenz force between the rails and accelerates the payload armature and projectile along at least one of the rails. The armature pushes the projectile for release through the muzzle.

Laboratory railguns have demonstrated launch velocities of over 2 km s considerably above those normally achieved in conventional propellant guns. Such velocities enable both increased range and elimination of energetic materials for propulsion. Physical and design constraints limit launch speeds and rail performance after firing multiple loads without structural or operational failure which often necessitates post mortem investigation of system fragments that have suffered damage from the intended operation.

Experiments with various high speed accelerators reveal existence of critical speeds causing group resonance with significant localized bending and buckling in barrels. These result in high tensile stress creation of gouges pits and cracks along rails delamination of insulators possible arc generation with high localized temperatures.

Ideal sensors to monitor deformation and temperature should survive harsh field environment and to be immune to strong electromagnetic fields. Sensors should have high sampling rate reasonably wide strain range reasonably high resolution short acquisition time and several channels to duplicate data in the case if one of the channels or one fiber fails . Sensors are often divided into two groups 1 Point sensors such as Fiber Bragg grating FBG sensors traditional foil strain gauges and accelerometers that can be used as point sensors for localized measurements and structural health monitoring.

These sensors are normally installed in suspicious or best guess points. Longer barrel structures may employ many from ten to one hundred point sensors to collect data along the whole length or area of a larger structure which can be cost prohibitive. 2 Continuous distributed full length or full area sensors include embedded or wrapped continuous optical fibers to be used for the measurements and structural health monitoring of the whole structure. In the current invention the preferred embodiment is distributed optical fiber sensors.

Conventional barrel condition monitoring yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In contrast various exemplary embodiments introduce fiber optic sensors into components for a launcher to monitor structural response to dynamic loading including buckling and induced temperature from frictional heating . Consequently the launcher rails can be repaired and or replaced prior to onset of damage that can degrade acceleration performance of a payload. The operational life of the rails and launcher may be significantly extended thereby.

Additionally continuous monitoring of strain and temperature of the launcher enables detection of excessive deformation and or temperature levels thereby serving as a diagnostic tool with which to interrupt operation to avoid serious damage. In particular the launcher provided for accelerating a projectile from an initial speed at a breech end to a launch speed at a muzzle end includes an electrically conductive rail equipped with fiber optic cable or fiber optic ribbon an array of several parallel fibers encased in a matrix polymer to measure transverse loads.

Various exemplary embodiments provide a system and a method for monitoring barrel deflection. This measurement system may be used to monitor a launcher assembly along a path along which to accelerate a projectile. This system includes an optical sensor a light emitter a light detector and a signal analyzer. The optical sensor is disposed in the barrel assembly at a position on the path and has initial and terminus ends.

The light emitter transmits an optical signal from the initial end. The light detector receives the optical signal from either the initial or terminus ends. The signal analyzer compares the optical signal from the detector to a quantifiable deformation and temperature in the barrel. For example the signal analyzer may issue an alarm indication in response to a detectable deflection exceeding a hazard condition threshold. The optical sensor preferably includes long multi mode or single mode fiber or long fiber Bragg grating between the initial and terminus ends. The fiber may be disposed along or wrapped in helical fashion around the length of the critical barrel components.

In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and logical mechanical and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.

Various exemplary embodiments provide for improvements in design and performance of launchers including e.g. electromagnetic rail guns . Such embodiments accomplish these objectives by providing a long continuous optical fiber to measure deformation and temperature of the launcher during operation.

The dynamic bending of the rail can be modeled as a Bernoulli Euler Beam based on the relation for the surface 

Damping provided by the elastic foundation attenuates the dynamic displacement of the surface . shows a graph with velocity as the abscissa and dynamic displacement amplification as the ordinate . The plotted lines include responses for undamped 2 damped of critical and 20 damped of critical. The peaks correspond to the critical velocity Vdenoted by a dash line at 1.2 km sec for the example geometry and material evaluated.

Similarly analytical solutions can be employed for thin tubes based on Timoshenko Love and Fl gge models. shows a substantially longitudinal view of a cylindrical shell in a local Cartesian coordinate system with x y and z respectively representing longitudinal angular and radial directions. shows the same shell from a cross sectional view. The outer extent of the shell forms the rim projecting half of the shell thickness h from the mid circumference which extends radius R from the centerline along the tube s axial length L. The equation of motion for the Timoshenko Love shell can be expressed as 

Finite element analysis yields radial displacement in the tube subjected to semi infinite pressure moving at constant speed along the tube length without damping. shows a graph with velocity as the abscissa and displacement amplification as the ordinate . The plotted line provides tube displacement absent damping. The inflection points correspond to 2 term Timoshenko Love critical velocity at 1.6 km sec a secondary critical velocity at 4.7 km sec and a decrease to plate wave speed at 5.3 km sec.

Monitoring of deformation and temperature in rail components can be used to mitigate rail damage. This can be accomplished by installing measurement instruments to visualize regions of large deformation and high temperature. Such sensors should preferably survive dynamic and thermal loads that cause high strain chemical reaction from oxidizing flames originating at both breech and muzzle ends of the launcher and strong electromagnetic fields.

Sensors for the measurement instrumentation should preferably have high sampling rate wide strain range moderate to high resolution short response time. The data recorder should preferably have multiple channels with rapid data acquisition. For example to satisfy the Nyquist condition with predicted strain wave frequencies of 100 kHz a sampling rate of 200 kHz is preferred. Strain range and resolution of 5000 me and 30 me respectively are preferred. For elastic waves having a wavelength of 3 cm gate lengths of less than one centimeter 

Continuous distributed sensors can be used for localized measurements and structural monitoring. Lengthy structures i.e. having high aspect ratio between longitudinal and transverse dimensions may employ several such sensors to collect data along the entire structure. These can be distributed uniformly or concentrated at analytically derived regions such as locations at which acceleration yields speeds approaching the critical velocity. Point instruments include fiber Bragg grating FBG sensors traditional foil strain gauges and accelerometers.

Various point instruments have advantages and disadvantages depending on application. For example foil strain gages and FBG sensors have higher strain ranges and better frequency responses than Fabry Perot sensors. By contrast Fabry Perot sensors and FBG sensors have higher strain sensitivity resolutions better durability lower complexity and improved electromagnetic interference immunity over foil strain gages. However FBG sensors cost more than their competing counterparts.

The distortion along the launcher barrel is shown in to visualize displacement measurable by sensors. The tube geometry shown in cross section is characterized by a radial distance R from the axial centerline. At critical speed the pressure field pushes against the surface along a moving pressure front thereby displacing the surface with a distortion wave region having a length of approximately 4R in the vicinity of the front .

Optical fiber sensors e.g. FBG type can be used continuously along the barrel length embedded or wrapped around critical components or locations along the launcher or alternatively as point sensors distributed along the length. Such wrapping can include disposing a fiber in helical fashion around the launcher structure. These sensors can employ optical glass or polymer fibers and be incorporated in fiber ribbons with arrays of parallel fibers embedded in a plastic matrix. Such sensors would possess high aspect ratio.

Conventional optical fibers are available in single mode or multi mode. Single mode fibers usually operate in the 1310 nm or 1550 nm regions where attenuation is lowest. This renders single mode fibers the preferred choice for long distance communications. Multimode fibers operate primarily at 850 nm and sometimes at 1300 nm. Multimode fibers are designed for short distance use the higher attenuation at 850 nm is offset by the use of more affordable optical sources the lower the wavelength the less expensive the optics . The three principal windows of operation include the 850 nm 1310 nm and 1550 nm wavelength bands.

These windows are observable in illustrating a bar chart of attenuation with wavelength as the abscissa against the attenuation as the ordinate . The solid line represents the extent to which the atmosphere interferes with electromagnetic transmissivity from infrared through visible wavelengths including water peaks that contribute to scattering or absorption. Windows and respectively denote near infrared and O medium infrared and C medium infrared bands of operation. Operating bands ranging from 1250 nm to 1680 nm include the O and C windows .

A monitoring system representing an embodiment for measuring launcher deflection can be described generally as follows. shows an exemplary system with a continuous optical fiber associated therewith i.e. disposed thereon and or integrated therein . Alternate configurations can be envisioned by disposing the additional point sensors substantially at distinct locations. The system provides a foundation to support a rail onto which is disposed a fiber optic sensor to measure rail deflection and installed in a manner to avoid interference with the armature and or its payload to be accelerated for example in grooves cut into the supporting insulator.

For an open loop configuration a light emitter such as a laser and a detector are respectively disposed at initial and terminal ends of the fiber optic sensor . The emitter transmits an optical signal that travels along the fibers and received by the detector . Depending on the magnitude of transverse deflection of barrel components caused by the moving load and temperature the fibers may also deform. In a preferred embodiment of the structural monitoring system an analyzer compares the received signal from the detector against corresponding deflection conditions as optionally stored in a database and issues a warning indication in response to deflection that exceeds an acceptable threshold.

Microbending and macrobending represent the most common forms of deformation in fibers. Microbends are microscopic distortions along the length of a fiber typically caused by pinching or squeezing the fiber by adjacent surfaces of the barrel components . Microbends deform the fiber s core slightly causing light to escape at these deflections. In single mode fiber microbending is wavelength dependant with microbend sensitivity increasing as you move to higher wavelengths like 1550 nm and especially 1625 nm. In multimode fiber microbend sensitivity is relatively constant across the wavelength spectrum so that 50 m multimode fiber has more microbend sensitivity than 62.5 m fiber due to its smaller core diameter.

Macrobending occurs when a fiber is bent i.e. transversely deflected in a tight radius. The bend curvature creates an angle too sharp for the light to be reflected back into the core and some of the light escapes through the fiber cladding causing attenuation. This optical power loss increases rapidly as the radius decreases to an inch or less. Both macrobending and microbending induce localized strain in the fiber. This bending strain affects the refractive index and the critical angle of the light ray in that specific area.

Consequently light traveling in the core refracts out causing attenuation or reduction of optical signal. With the use of the common Optical Time Domain Reflectometer OTDR the macrobending and microbending signals are distinguished from each other and thus indicate location and type of bending along the length of the fiber. Major localized bending and buckling in the structural components of the launcher barrel can be examined from the OTDR image along the fiber length. In a number of applications including high electric power launchers presence of water in barrels or excessive humidity present operational hazards.

In addition to the deformation induced by loads and temperature optical fibers sense presence of water molecules that degrade their material forming OH hydroxyl radical groups. In glass fibers at the 950 nm 1380 nm and 2730 nm wavelengths the presence of hydroxyl radicals causes substantial increase in attenuation. Exposure of fibers to water molecules for extended duration forms the hydroxyl OH ions that affect signal attenuation. Existing detection methods also include Rayleigh scattering i.e. the scattering of light energy as it passes through the core of a fiber strand due to the light wave electrons colliding with non glass molecules usually water.

In an addition embodiment the signal analyzer uses Polarization Mode Dispersion PMD caused by asymmetric distortions to the fiber from a perfect cylindrical geometry. At high bit rates typically exceeding 5 Gbps the PMD can be used to sense mechanical stress exerted upon the fiber due to extrinsically induced bends and contact forces. Single mode optical fiber supports one fundamental mode which consists of two orthogonal polarization modes. This asymmetry introduces small refractive index differences for the two polarization states known as birefringence that causes one polarization mode to travel faster than the other resulting in a difference in the propagation time called the differential group delay DGD . This unit of DGD describes PMD and DGD is typically measured in picoseconds.

A fiber that acquires birefringence causes a propagating pulse to lose the balance between the polarization components. This leads to different polarization components traveling at different velocities creating a pulse spread. Other types of signal analysis including more than one laser and loop configuration of the fiber sensors can be used to monitor load induced and temperature induced deformations in high speed launchers.

Such systems and methods enable real time analysis of deflection during operation to accelerate the armature and projectile rather than conduct diagnostic post operation autopsy from expended materials that remain post test. Thus such arrangements enable more complete information to be obtained about test operations on accelerators and launchers to thereby facilitate analysis for developing mitigation techniques to reduce transverse deflection and resultant damage to the launcher s structure.

While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein many modifications substitutions changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments.
