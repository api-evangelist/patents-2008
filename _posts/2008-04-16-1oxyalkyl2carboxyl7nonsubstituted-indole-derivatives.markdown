This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60 949 683 filed Jul. 13 2007 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60 912 049 filed Apr. 16 2007 which is hereby incorporated by reference.

This invention pertains to compounds which inhibit the activity of anti apoptotic Mcl 1 protein compositions containing the compounds and methods of treating diseases involving overexpressed or unregulated Mcl 1 protein.

Mcl 1 protein is associated with a number of diseases. There is therefore an existing need in the therapeutic arts for compounds which bind to and inhibit the activity of Mcl 1 protein.

One embodiment of this invention therefore pertains to compounds which inhibit the activity of Mcl 1 protein the compounds having Formula I

Compounds of this invention may contain asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms in the R or S configuration wherein the terms R and S are as defined in Pure Appl. Chem. 1976 45 13 10. Compounds having asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms with equal amounts of R and S configurations are racemic at those atoms. Atoms having excess of one configuration over the other are assigned the configuration in excess preferably an excess of about 85 90 more preferably an excess of about 95 99 and still more preferably an excess greater than about 99 . Accordingly this invention is meant to embrace racemic mixtures relative and absolute diastereoisomers and the compounds thereof.

Compounds of this invention may also contain carbon carbon double bonds or carbon nitrogen double bonds in the Z or E configuration in which the term Z represents the larger two substituents on the same side of a carbon carbon or carbon nitrogen double bond and the term E represents the larger two substituents on opposite sides of a carbon carbon or carbon nitrogen double bond. The compounds of this invention may also exist as a mixture of Z and E isomers.

Compounds of this invention containing NH C O H C O OH C O NH OH or SH moieties may have attached thereto prodrug forming moieties. The prodrug forming moieties are removed by metabolic processes and release the compounds having the freed NH C O H C O OH C O NH OH or SH in vivo. Prodrugs are useful for adjusting such pharmacokinetic properties of the compounds as solubility and or hydrophobicity absorption in the gastrointestinal tract bioavailability tissue penetration and rate of clearance.

Metabolites of compounds having Formula I produced by in vitro or in vivo metabolic processes may also have utility for treating diseases caused or exacerbated by overexpressed or unregulated Mcl 1 protein.

Certain precursor compounds of compounds having Formula I may be metabolized in vitro or in vivo to form compounds having Formula I and may thereby also have utility for treating diseases caused or exacerbated by overexpressed or unregulated Mcl 1 protein.

Compounds having Formula I may exist as acid addition salts basic addition salts or zwitterions. Salts of compounds having Formula I are prepared during their isolation or following their purification. Acid addition salts are those derived from the reaction of a compound having Formula I with acid.

 Fam NoxaCF 6 FAM GELEVEFATQLRRFGDKLNF amide SEQ. ID NO. 1 was made on a 433A automated synthesizer Applied Biosystems Foster City Calif. using standard Fastmoc deprotection coupling cycles with 0.25 mmol MBHA Rink amide resin SynPep Dublin Calif. . Cartridges containing NFmoc amino acids 1 mmol with side chain protection Arg 2 2 5 7 8 pentamethylchroman 6 sulfonyl Asp and Glu tert butyl ester Asn Cys Gln and His trityl Lys and Trp tert butyloxycarbonyl Ser Thr and Tyr tert butyl ether were activated with O benzotriazol 1 yl N N N N tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate 1 mmol 1 hydroxybenzotriazole 1 mmol and diisopropylethylamine 2 mmol in N methylpyrrolidone NMP . The activated amino acid was coupled for 30 minutes following removal of the N terminal Fmoc group with 20 piperidine in NMP. Labeling was accomplished by suspending the resin bound N terminally deprotected side chain protected peptide resin 0.04 mmol and 6 carboxyfluorescein NHS ester 57 mg in anhydrous dimethylformamide 2 mL containing 0.02 mL diisopropylethylamine DIEA and shaking at ambient temperature overnight. The resin was drained washed 3 times with 1 1 dichloromethane methanol and dried. The labeled resin was cleaved and deprotected by mixing with TFA water thioanisole phenol 3 6 dioxa 1 8 octanedithiol triisopropylsilane 80 5 5 5 2.5 2.5 for 3 hours at ambient temperature. Following evaporation under reduced pressure the crude peptide was recovered by precipitation with ether. The product was purified on a preparative HPLC running Unipoint analysis software Gilson Inc. Middleton Wis. on a 25 mm 200 mm radial compression column containing Delta Pak Cpacking Waters Inc. Taunton Mass. with a flow rate of 20 mL min. The peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1 TFA water and acetonitrile. Fractions containing the product were combined and lyophilized. The purity of the final products were confirmed by reverse phase analytical HPLC on a Hewlett Packard 1050 series system with diode array and fluorescence detection Agilent Technologies Palo Alto Calif. eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1 trifluoroacetic acid water and acetonitrile on a 4.6 250 mm YMC ODS AQ 5 m 120 column Waters Inc. to give the product 45.6 mg as a yellow powder following lyophilization. The identity of the product was confirmed by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrography MALDI MS on a Voyager DE PRO Applied Biosystems m z 1470.00 and 1448.01 M H .

A fluorescence polarization assay was used for ICdetermination of representative compounds having Formula I against recombinant Mcl 1 protein. Compounds were series diluted in DMSO starting at 10 M and transferred 5 L into a 96 well plate. Then 120 L of a mixture containing 10 nM fluorescent Noxa BH3 peptide and 80 nM Mcl 1 protein was added to each well. For each assay free peptide controls fluorescent peptide only and bound peptide controls fluorescent peptide in the presence of Mcl 1 were included on each assay plate. The plate was mixed on a shaker for 1 minute and incubated at room temperature for an additional 15 minutes. The polarization in mP was measured at room temperature with excitation wavelength at 485 nm and emission wavelength at 530 nm using an Analyst LJL Molecular Dynamic Sunnyvale Calif. . The percentage inhibition was calculated by inhibition 100 1 mP mP mP mP in which mPis the free peptide control and mPis the bound peptide control. Based on percentage of inhibition the IC inhibitor concentration at which 50 of bound peptide is displaced obtained by fitting the inhibition data using Prism 3.0 software Graphpad Software Inc San Diego Calif. . The results are shown in TABLE 1.

These data demonstrate the utility of representative compounds having Formula I as inhibitors of the activity of Mcl 1 protein.
