The present specification relates generally to communication networks and more particularly relates to a system and method for dynamic provisioning.

A wide range of protocols are now available for telecommunication links often for the same device. For example a single modern mobile electronic device with telephony and data capabilities can often select between one or more of 3G 2G and Unlicensed Mobile Access UMA access technologies and protocols. Furthermore those same access technologies and protocols can themselves be available on multiple channels and through different providers for the same device.

Such electronic devices are often individually provisioned according to specific desires or wishes of an individual as arranged with a given provider. For example even though the device can be capable of utilizing 3G access technologies and protocols 3G the device can be provisioned so that it uses 2G access technologies and protocols 2G . Different applications can also be provisioned to use different access technologies and protocols from the same device depending on context. Problems can arise however when the device is provisioned in a manner that is not consistent with the offerings of a given network to which the device is connected or when transient conditions within a given network result in a suboptimal delivery of one or more services using one or more access technologies and protocols.

In addition to the array of devices protocols and their specific provisioning issues within these hybrid networks there is also a complex echo system of walled garden applications mobile services and content services. These value added services VAS represent an increasing source of subscriber revenues as traditional voice messaging and data services are commoditized. Recognizing the need to find additional sources of subscriber revenue to offset the commoditization of traditional services network operators are starting to deploy and support more of these VAS applications. In turn these VAS applications are increasing in complexity with respect to their interaction both with the subscriber and also with the existing elements within the network. Examples include social networking based applications which integrate subscriber profile and preferences location presence and enhanced messaging into a consolidated subscriber experience. That is the delivery of contemporary and anticipated value added services requires the orchestration of an increasingly complex network of network elements service delivery nodes content partners operational support systems business support systems bearer and transport systems as well as access technologies used to link the network to electronic devices. A disruption in one or more of these components can result in a material degradation of one or more services provided by the network operator to a given electronic device.

This new mobile landscape of high speed multimedia devices which leverage several network technologies simultaneously combined with the ecosystem of VAS applications presents a new and unique challenge to a network operator s customer care organization to provide adequate technical support to customers. Not only does a customer service representative need to understand the provisioning and status of the device within the network but also the status and issues with the VAS applications and the subscriber s status and activity within these applications.

Within the typical carrier support for new applications and services is often undertaken by presenting the customer care organization with a new interface or set of interfaces to perform provisioning and technical troubleshooting of the new service. Examples would include an interface to troubleshoot and provision a wireless email service or an online photo album. The customer care organization must train staff to be capable of maintaining an expert level trouble shooting experience on a continuously increasing number of systems and interfaces. When this is coupled with the fact that customer service is a high churn industry carriers are forced to absorb the increasing cost and time commitments to getting new support staff up to speed. Another impact of the increasing support complexity is that new services take longer to roll out and when they do customer satisfaction CSAT may not be optimal as they do not get the support they need on the first call when they reach the call center.

An aspect of the specification provides a method for dynamically provisioning at least one of a network and a portable electronic device comprising 

provisioning at least one of the network and the device within the network according to an alternative profile if the normal profile and the network state are not consistent.

The normal profile can comprises a first link according to a first protocol and the alternative profile is based on a second link having a different protocol than the first link. The alternative profile can include modifying a billing rate associated with usage of the second link. The billing rate can be equal to or less than a rate associated with the normal profile. The billing rate can be sent to a billing server in association with usage of the device according to the alternative profile.

The method can further comprise sending the message to a billing server to modify billing associated with usage of the device according to the alternative profile.

The method can further comprise receiving a device state and wherein the determining step further comprises determining if the device state is consistent with the normal profile and the network state.

The method can further comprise repeating the receiving and determining steps and provisioning the device within the network according to the normal profile if the normal profile and the network state are consistent.

Another aspect of the specification provides a provisioning engine comprising a processor and a plurality of interfaces interconnected by the processor. The interfaces are connectable to a plurality of network elements a network management server and an electronic device via a network. The processor is configured to receive data representing a network state of the network via the network management server. The processor is also configured to maintain a profile associated with the electronic device. The processor is further configured to determine if the normal profile and the network state are consistent and to provision the device within the network via the network elements according to an alternative profile if the normal profile and the network state are not consistent.

The normal profile can comprise a first link according to a first protocol and the alternative profile is based on a second link having a different protocol than the first link. The alternative profile can include modifying a billing rate associated with usage of the second link. The rate can be equal to or less than a rate associated with the normal profile.

The processor can be further configured to send the billing rate to a billing server in association with usage of the device according to the alternative profile.

The processor can be further configured to send the message to a billing server to modify billing associated with usage of the device according to the alternative profile.

Electronic device also includes a plurality of network interfaces implemented in the form of radios in the present embodiment. Each network interface is configured for conducting wireless communications over its respective link . For example link can be based on the Global System for Mobile communications GSM or Code Division Multiple Access CDMA protocol link can be based on the 2G protocols e.g. Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution EDGE protocol or CDMA2000 1xRTT link can be based on 3G protocols e.g. High Speed Packet Access HSPA Wideband Code Division Multiple Access WCDMA Long Term Evolution LTE CDMA2000 EV DO or CDMA2000 EV DV and link can be based on unlicensed mobile access UMA protocols. The foregoing components are interconnected by a microcomputer comprised of one or more central processing units connected to volatile memory e.g. random access memory and non volatile memory e.g. FLASH memory . As will be discussed further below in a present embodiment volatile memory also maintains a device provisioning profile Pd that indicates criterion or criteria for usage of different network interfaces as well as applications supported by the device and services rendered by the device e.g. a mobile TV or video streaming service . As will be explained further below however provisioning profile Pd can be omitted or complemented in certain embodiments by provisioning states and profiles maintained and or derived by engine .

It should now be understood that in other embodiments electronic device can be based on other types of mobile computing devices including the computing environment of a desktop computer a workstation a thin client or the like.

Referring again to system also comprises a dynamic provisioning engine that connects to core network via a gateway .

It will also be understood that engine can be implemented as a plurality of servers to provide scalability.

As indicated above engine connects to mobile network via one or more gateways in order to provide updates to the subscriber S or device with respect to their provisioned status in the mobile network or device . Gateway includes network infrastructure that is complementary to the protocol s supported by base stations and backhaul links . Such network elements and service delivery nodes are discussed further below as elements . Gateway can be for example a Short Message Service Center SMSC or Multimedia Message Service Center MMSC so that engine can send short messages to device an instant messaging server so that engine can send instant message notifications to subscriber S or a device or an e mail server so that engine can sent e mail notifications to a subscriber or device . Gateway can also be a provisioning gateway for sending device provisioning information e.g. device provisioning profile Pd to device . Those skilled in the art will recognize that a variety of gateways can be used to convey updates and messages to or from the subscriber S or device . Those skilled in the art will recognize that the gateway can also be used in order to receive inputs or commands from the subscriber S or device . For example an e mail response can be received from subscriber S or device via mobile network by an e mail server whereby the addressing information indicates that the destination of the message is the engine and the content of the message indicates that the subscriber has either acknowledged his her modified provisioned state in mobile network and or device . As another example a SMS message can be received from device via mobile network by an SMS C whereby the addressing information indicates that the destination of the message is the engine and the content of the message indicates that the subscriber has selected a preferred state relative to two or more options offered to the subscriber. Those skilled in the art will recognize that in certain embodiments gateway s may be linked to or incorporated within elements e.g. SMSC MMSC .

Engine also connects to a customer service terminal that can be used by a customer service representative CSR. In various optional embodiments a subscriber S at device can contact customer service representative CSR via mobile network so that subscriber S can indicate to customer service representative CSR a desired profile as can be reflected via provisioning profile Pd for subscriber S or device and likewise customer service representative CSR can then interact with engine to implement the desired profile. In various optional embodiments a subscriber S can contact customer service representative CSR via a telephone and PSTN so that subscriber S can indicate to customer service representative CSR a desired profile as can be reflected via provisioning profile Pd for subscriber S or device and likewise customer service representative CSR can then interact with engine to implement the desired profile. In various optional embodiments the engine can autonomously highlight discrepancies as well as recommend one or more alternative provisioned states for either the mobile network or device to the customer service representative CSR. The customer service representative CSR can resolve the discrepancies implement one or more alternative provisioned states as recommended by engine or implement another provisioned state upon the explicit instruction of the customer service representative via engine .

In various optional embodiments engine can autonomously implement provisioned states in the mobile network . To the extent that a customer service representative CSR retrieves the provisioned state of subscriber S or device engine will optionally indicate any autonomous action s undertaken by engine to resolve a discrepancy or modify the provisioned state of a subscriber S or device as well as any communication with subscriber S or device including updates sent to subscriber S or device as well as any input or commands received from subscriber S or device . Engine also connects to one or more profile data servers . . . generically profile data server and collectively profile data servers . Profile data servers are also referred to elsewhere in this specification as simply profile servers . Profile data servers contain subscriber S or device data e.g. language preferences subscribed features or applications capabilities and features of the device usage data e.g. usage records pertaining to services used by the subscriber S or device or contextual data e.g. state of the subscriber in a given application e.g. current progress information in a given game location information in various geodetic formats generic presence and state information e.g. on line off line busy available do no disturb happy sad . Those skilled in the art will recognize that a subset of the information contained in profile data servers may be applicable to or directly linked to the information contained in profile P for device . Engine can access and modify subscriber S or device data resident in profile data servers in order to correct or modify the provisioned state of subscriber S or device via a variety of protocols and interfaces including lightweight directory access protocol LDAP as well as application programming interfaces APIs based on based on Common Object Request Broker Architecture CORBA or Simple Object Access Protocol Extensible Markup Language SOAP XML . For example engine can modify a device s maximum data rate to 64 Kbps via a 2G access technology and protocol as a subset of the default provisioning state for subscriber S or device upon detection of a network congestion scenario via diagnostic servers . As another example engine can activate services and applications e.g. mobile TV services upon detection that the device has been modified to be 3G capable e.g. by installing the subscriber s subscriber identification module SIM in a 3G capable device . Engine can also access and modify subscriber S or device data resident in profile data servers via a network profile server that provides access to retrieve and modify subscriber S or device data via one or more abstracted APIs. The foregoing teachings relative to the network profile server can be supplemented by the teachings of copending application PCT CA2007 001570 METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR ACTIVE PROFILE SERVER and the teachings of U.S. Pat. No. 7 379 737 Telecommunications subscriber profile management system the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Those skilled in the art will recognize that in certain embodiments profile data servers may be linked to or incorporated within elements e.g. Home Location Register Home Subscriber Server Gateway Mobile Location Centre diagnostic servers and OSS BSS servers .

Engine also connects to one or more OSS BSS servers . . . generically OSS BSS server and collectively OSS BSS servers . OSS BSS server can be based on a service control point SCP or the like in the prepaid context or it can be based on a billing server utilizing customer detail records CDR or the like in the post paid context or OSS BSS server can be based on combinations or enhancements thereof. In general OSS BSS are configured to maintain and process rating and billing information relative to subscriber S or device . Engine can connect to OSS BSS servers directly via a number of interfaces and protocols including APIs as well as via a charging gateway not shown . The foregoing teachings relative to the charging gateway can be supplemented by the teachings of copending patent application publication US 20040105424 Method for implementing an Open Charging OC middleware platform and gateway system the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. For example engine can access OSS BSS servers to provision a new price plan relating to a new provisioned state in the mobile network e.g. the subscriber S or device default access technology and protocol was modified from 3G to 2G access resulting in a reduced data charging tariff . As another example the customer service representative can select a proposed provisioning state as recommended by engine in conjunction with a credit value which can be applied to the subscriber s S or device s pre paid or post paid balance or account as the case may be.

Engine also connects to a plurality of network elements . . . which are a part of mobile network . Network elements can thus comprise one or more of a Home Location Register HLR Home Subscriber Server HSS Gateway Mobile Location Center GMLC Mobile Switching Center MSC Visitor Location Register VLR Equipment Identity Register EIR Short Message Service Center SMSC Multimedia Message Service Center MMSC Authentication Centre AuC Subscriber Locator Function SLF Gateway MSC GSMC Serving General Packet Radio Service GPRS Support Node SGSN Gateway GPRS Support Node GGSN Cell Broadcast Center CBC Packet Data Serving Node PDSN Call Session Control Function CSCF Media Gateway Control Function MGCF IP Multimedia Subsystem Media Gateway Function IMS MGW Multimedia Resource Function Controller MRFC Multimedia Resource Function Processor MRFP Breakout Gateway Control Function BGCF Application Server AS Interconnection Border Control Function IBCF Signalling Gateway Function SGW Security Gateway SEG Application Function AF Policy Decision Function PDF WLAN Access Gateway WAG Packet Data Gateway PDG Broadcast Multicast Service Centre Policy and Charging Rules Function PCRF Policy and Charging Enforcement Function PCEF UMA Network Controller UNC Signal Transfer Point STP an Authentication Authorization Accounting server AAA a voicemail server VM a UMA server a remote management server RMS a Blackberry Enterprise Server BES or a Blackberry Internet Server BIS . Engine can connect to network elements directly via a variety of interfaces and protocols or via a provisioning server not shown in order to access retrieve or modify the provisioned state associated with a subscriber S or device . Those skilled in the art will recognize that the nature of the network elements will evolve with advances in network technologies and will include new or modified network elements as prescribed by but not limited to 3GPP TS 23.002 Network Architecture and 3GPP2 X.S0013 All IP Core Network Multimedia Domain as amended from time to time. Engine can be configured to include appropriate interfaces and protocol converters to communicate with each of gateway s profile data servers OSS BSS servers network elements network profile server s diagnostic servers and network management server s in a manner that is native to each of those components so that no modification to those components is required.

Network elements represent elements that are part of backhaul links and core network according to the protocol s being supported by base stations that are connected to device . Thus as a non limiting example assume that network element is an MSC and is used to provide circuit switched connectivity to device via backhaul links and base station network element is a SGSN and is used to provide 2G packet switched connectivity to device via backhaul links and base station network element not shown is a UMA Network Controller that is used to provide UMA connectivity to device via base station and backhaul link . However in more complex examples it will be understood that a plurality of different network elements can reside within the core network and along each backhaul link as appropriate to structurally define a particular service for a subscriber S or device .

Engine also connects to one or more diagnostic servers . . . generically diagnostic server and collectively diagnostic servers directly or via a network management server . Diagnostic servers are also part of mobile network . Network management server or collectively diagnostic servers is are configured to provide the overall state of mobile network . Examples of diagnostic servers include servers configured to execute HP Openview from Hewlett Packard Company 3000 Hanover Street Palo Alto Calif. 94304 1185 USA or an SS7 Link Monitor such as that described in SS7 Link Monitors More new technology that will affect billing Ed Finegold May 1 1997 B OSS Billing and OSS World http www.billingworld.com articies archives ss7 link monitors more new technology that.html. For example diagnostic servers can be placed along each backhaul link so as to provide network diagnostics and or state information about each backhaul link . As another example diagnostic servers or network management server can monitor the status of network elements via operational measurement logs and event records as well as interfaces and protocols including but not limited to Simple Network Management Protocol SNMP in order to determine the status of the network and associated applications and services. In an non limiting embodiment engine can be informed of a transient event in mobile network e.g. a degradation of 3G service in a given geographic region served by a set of base stations . The engine can take proactive steps to modify the provisioned state associated with subscriber S or device in order to optimize the delivery of services as well as the price or rate plans relative to the state of the mobile network and the subscriber S or device profile and usage patterns as maintained by the profile data servers. The engine can also notify the subscriber S or device via gateway of the transient event and the proactive steps undertaken on behalf of the subscriber S or device . In another embodiment the engine can solicit confirmation from subscriber S or device via gateway before implementing a new provisioned state on behalf of subscriber S or device . In another embodiment engine can provide two or more options and receive input with respect to the preferred option before implementing a new provisioned state on behalf of subscriber S or device .

Referring now to a flowchart depicting a method for dynamic provisioning is indicated generally at . Method can be implemented using system or a variant thereof.

To assist with understanding method it will be discussed according to a possible implementation of method using system . To further assist with understanding method the following assumptions will be made about system . It will be assumed that 

c interface link are configured to operate using the 3G protocol and that base station and backhaul link are additionally configured to operate using a 3G protocol and

It will also be further assumed that element and diagnostic server are associated with link that element and diagnostic server are associated with link and that element and diagnostic server are associated with link . Element can therefore be any type of known network element that is consistent with a GSM network such as an HLR a VLR an MSC an SMSC or the like that operates according to the standards that govern GSM. Element can therefore be any type of known network element that is consistent with a EDGE access technology and protocol such as an HLR a VLR an MSC an SGSN a GGSN or the like that operates according to the standards that govern EDGE. Element can therefore be any type of known network element that is consistent with a 3G network such as an HLR a VLR an MSC an SGSN a GGSN a PCEF a PCRF a CSCF or the like that operates according to the 3G standard. Element can therefore be any type of known network element that is consistent with a UMA network such as an AAA server a UNC a PDG or the like that operates according to the standards that govern a UMA network. Those skilled in the art will recognize that other network elements may be used in the context of other access technologies. For example a packet serving data node PDSN for a code division multiple access CDMA based network the IP edge router for a European Telecommunications Standards Institute ETSI based network the cable Modem termination system CMTS for a PacketCable based network a access service network ASN gateway for a WiMax based network or a deep packet inspection node for a generic internet protocol based network.

It will also be assumed that profile associated with subscriber S and device is defined to according the contents of Table I. In an embodiment the profile may be correlated with device profile P .

Explaining Table I in greater detail network interface using the GSM protocol and network interface using the EDGE protocol are indicated as Permitted according to the established profile for subscriber S or device meaning that subscriber S or device is permitted to conduct communications over links and . However network interface using the 3G protocol and network interface using the UMA protocol are indicated as Not Permitted meaning that device is not permitted to conduct communications over links and even though links and may be available. It should be understood that the profile for subscriber S or device in Table I is highly simplified for purposes of explanation. More complex examples of profiles will be provided further below.

Continuing now with the explanation of method block comprises receiving the state and context of subscriber S or device . In system block is performed by engine receiving state and context information about subscriber S or device . Such state and context information about subscriber S or device can be obtained by querying elements profile data servers network profile server network management server OSS BSS servers and diagnostic servers . Exemplary queries in an embodiment include retrieving the current subscription rate plan service and application profile information for subscriber S or device . Exemplary queries in an embodiment also include retrieving the active access technologies for a given subscriber S or device e.g. 2G 3G UMA which applications or services are active or resident on a device e.g. circuit switched voice instant messaging mobile TV the current location of subscriber S or device e.g. device is presently served by base station with associated geodetic coordinates device is presently located at WGS 84 coordinates 6 378 137.0 m semi major axis a 6 356 752.314 245 m semi minor axis b 298.257 223 563 inverse flattening which application servers are providing services to subscriber S or device e.g. element not shown an instant messaging server is supporting the instant messaging application resident on device . In the example shown in a query to diagnostic servers would return an indication that links and are active. In another example a query to network elements e.g. an HLR would indicate that the device has registered on the network and has requested services to be provided via GSM and EDGE. In another example a query to profile servers would indicate that one or more value added services e.g. instant messaging mobile TV associated with subscriber S or device are active or inactive as the case may be.

Block comprises receiving the network state. The network state can include the state of the associated network infrastructure that is used to manage or provide services to the subscriber or device including network elements service delivery nodes content partners operational support systems business support systems bearer and transport systems as well as access technologies used to link the network to electronic devices. In system block is performed by engine receiving state information about mobile network from diagnostic servers directly or via network management server . In other embodiments engine can also receive state information about mobile network from elements or OSS BSS servers . In the example shown in diagnostic servers or network management server would provide availability and status information about backhaul links . . . as well as the associated network infrastructure used to provide services to subscriber S or device . For example a query to diagnostic servers or network management server would indicate the status and availability for network element not shown an instant messaging server that is supporting an instant messaging application resident on device .

Block comprises receiving the provisioned status of subscriber S or device including current device provisioning as well as the current provisioning of network infrastructure that manage or provide services to the subscriber or device including network elements service delivery nodes content partners operational support systems business support systems bearer and transport systems as well as access technologies used to link the mobile network to the device . In system block is performed by engine receiving provisioned status information for subscriber S or device from profile data servers or network profile server . In other embodiments engine can also receive subscriber S or device provisioned status information from OSS BSS servers . In the example shown in profile data servers or network profile server would provide provisioned status information used to provide services to subscriber S or device . For example a query to profile data servers or network profile server would indicate that the subscriber is subscribed to receive GSM and EDGE services and has an active subscription to an instant messaging service. As another example a query to profile data servers network profile server or OSS BSS servers would indicate that the subscriber is associated with a pre paid account and application specific rate plan for the instant messaging service as well as a post paid account and associated rate plan for a number of GSM and EDGE services. In an embodiment the engine may query the history and usage patterns associated with subscriber S or device including the actions invoked using device and usage of network resources as typically indicated by event records generated or maintained by network elements service delivery nodes content partners operational support systems business support systems bearer and transport systems as well as access technologies used to link the mobile network to device . For example the engine may query profile data servers network profile server or OSS BSS servers and ascertain that subscriber S has exceeded the allocated volume of minutes or data associated with the subscriber s rate plan by more than 25 for the last three consecutive billing periods or that the subscriber S has repeatedly requested services that are not readily provided by the default access technologies e.g. mobile TV or Voice over IP via EDGE .

The hashed box in labelled with reference represent that the blocks and collectively constitute a method of receiving the state and context of a device or subscriber on a network. The specific blocks and reflect one sub method of implementing block comprised of receiving the state and context of subscriber S or device receiving the network state and receiving the provisioned status of subscriber S or device including current device provisioning as well as the current provisioning of network infrastructure. Of note is that not all blocks of method need be performed in order to retrieve the data associated with block .

To the extent that a subscriber is associated with multiple devices it should be understood that blocks and can be re performed for each device associated with subscriber S.

Block comprises determining whether the state and context of subscriber S or device from block the network state from block and the provisioned status of subscriber S or device from block are consistent. If yes then method advances from block to block where subscriber S or device is provisioned in a manner that is consistent with the provisioned status received at block . In the example in a yes determination would be made at block because a the state and context of subscriber S or device including the status of the available network interfaces and links are consistent with the available backhaul links and device has registered with mobile network and the requested services are consistent with the capabilities provided by mobile network b the associated network infrastructure including links and and network elements are active and available or operational for the purpose of providing the subscribed or requested services for subscriber S or device and c the provisioned status associated with subscriber S or device is consistent with the state and context of subscriber S or device as well as the network state associated with network infrastructure used to provide services to subscriber S or device e.g. the network is capable of providing GSM and EDGE services to device via backhaul links and the instant messaging server is active and can support the instant messaging service resident on device via backhaul link .

In an embodiment at block engine may optionally proactively apply or reaffirm provisioned states in network elements OSS BSS servers profile servers directly or via network profile server . In an embodiment at block engine may optionally proactively apply or reaffirm provisioned states for device in profile P to comply with the provisioned state of the mobile network .

To the extent that a subscriber may be associated with multiple devices it should be understood that blocks can be re performed for each device associated with subscriber S.

Upon completion of block which is optional method returns to block where method begins anew. At this point it is useful to vary certain assumptions about system for purposes of further explanation. showed one set of assumptions about system wherein the various links that were available to device were consistent with the profile according to Table I that is associated with subscriber S or device . shows another set of assumptions about system wherein various links that are available to subscriber S or device are NOT consistent with the profile according to Table I that is associated with subscriber S or device . Of note is that in backhaul links and are disabled for whatever reason and therefore base stations and are not connected to core network essentially rendering links and unavailable to subscriber S or device .

Thus when blocks are performed using the assumptions in a No determination is made at block . More specifically in the example in a No determination would be made at block because a the state and context of subscriber S or device including the status of the available network interfaces are not consistent with the disabled backhaul links and device has effectively deregistered with mobile network and previously requested services cannot be provided by mobile network b a subset of the associated network infrastructure including links and are inactive otherwise not operational for the purpose of providing the subscribed or requested services for subscriber S or device and c the provisioned status associated with subscriber S or device is not consistent with the state and context of subscriber S or device as well as the network state associated with network infrastructure used to provide services to subscriber S or device e.g. the network is not capable of providing GSM and EDGE services to device via backhaul links and the instant messaging server is active and cannot support the instant messaging service resident on device via disabled backhaul link . Furthermore at block an update of the network state indicates that while links and are unavailable that link is available and that link is available. Thus at block a determination is made that the state and context of subscriber S or device from block the network state from block and the provisioned status of subscriber S or device from block are NOT consistent and therefore a No determination is made at block .

Block comprises determining alternative provisioning for subscriber S device or mobile network . In the example of an alternative provisioning for subscriber S or device can be determined so that UMA connectivity is provided to device via link base station and backhaul link as well as any other relevant network elements associated with core network . Specifically at block a modified provisioned state that uses UMA connectivity would be determined as a the requested services associated with subscriber S or device are consistent with capabilities provided with mobile network using UMA connectivity for example voice and instant messaging services can be provided using UMA connectivity b the network infrastructure associated with UMA connectivity including link base station and backhaul link as well as any other relevant network elements associated with core network are active and available or operational for the purpose of providing the subscribed or requested services for subscriber S or device and c the alternative provisioned state for the subscriber S device and mobile network would result in a state and context for subscriber S and device that is relatively consistent with the default i.e. in accordance with Table I state and context for subscriber S and device in the context of the default services and applications which would otherwise be made available to subscriber S or device prior to the transient events that caused one or more disruptions within mobile network for example voice and instant messaging services can be provided using UMA connectivity .

Block comprises provisioning the subscriber S device and mobile network according to the alternative provisioning from block . represents this exemplary performance of block wherein device is shown in communication with core network via link base station and backhaul link . At block engine will update the provisioned state associated with subscriber S device and mobile network in network elements OSS BSS servers profile servers directly or via network profile server . In an embodiment at block engine may optionally apply new provisioned states for device in profile P to comply with the provisioned state of the mobile network . For example in the case of UMA connectivity this may include the activation of the associated network interface and configuration of various firewall settings in profile P . In an embodiment engine can access OSS BSS servers to provision a new price plan relating to a new provisioned state in the mobile network for example a reduced tariff may be applied in connection with any potential inconvenience that may be associated with the new provisioned state for the subscriber S device or mobile network . As another example engine can access OSS BSS servers for the purpose of applying a credit value which can be applied to the subscriber s S or device s pre paid or post paid balance or account as the case may be.

Block which is optional comprises sending one or messages indicating the alternative provisioning. One such message can be sent directly to subscriber S or device indicating for example We apologize that your regular GSM EDGE service has been disrupted. We are temporarily routing your communications via a UMA connection until regular GSM EDGE service is restored. An additional message can be sent to subscriber S or device indicating that a credit e.g. air time or other non monetary credit or currency or other monetary credit is being applied to an account associated with subscriber S or device to compensate for the service disruption.

To the extent that a subscriber may be associated with multiple devices it should be understood that blocks and can be re performed for each device associated with subscriber S. Of note the alternative network provisioning state determined and applied via blocks and can be unique to each device or set to the same provisioned alternative state subject to the subscriber and device state and context received for each device via block .

Method then advances from block to block where the method begins anew. The provisioning initially made at block can remain in effect until such time as mobile network returns to a state so that a yes determination can be made at block relative to the default profile associated with subscriber S or device or the provisioning determined at block and implemented at block can be continually adjusted until such a time a yes determination can be made at block relative to the default profile associated with subscriber S or device . System can also be configured to send various messages indicating that device has been returned to normal provisioning when a yes determination can be made at block relative to the default profile associated with subscriber S or device .

In another embodiment method can be adapted to be made responsive to asynchronous updates from the mobile network . For example in an embodiment of block the profile data servers network profile server network elements network management server or diagnostic server may proactively provide state and context information with respect to subscriber S or device For example network profile server may determine that the subscriber has activated an new device for example the subscriber inserts his her Subscriber Identification Module SIM into a new device which is associated with additional resident applications and new interfaces and notify engine of the modified state of device associated with subscriber S. In an embodiment of block the diagnostic servers or network management server proactively provides status and availability information with respect to the network state including the state of the associated network infrastructure that is used to manage or provide services to the subscriber or device. For example diagnostic servers or network management server may determine that a state of congestion is occurring in one or more base stations or backhaul links and notify engine of the state and availability of the affected network infrastructure. In an embodiment of block the profile data servers network profile server or OSS BSS servers may proactively provide provisioned status information with respect to subscriber S or device . For example profile data servers network profile server or OSS BSS servers may determine that the subscriber has elected to subscribe to a new service package and or a new rate plan and notify engine of the modified provisioned status information with respect to subscriber S or device . Of note in response to an asynchronous update the remaining blocks associated with sub method would be invoked as required and then method would continue at block as previously described.

Referring now to a flowchart depicting a method for provisioning the state of the subscriber S device or mobile network that is responsive to a subscriber request call to a customer service representative CSR is indicated generally at . Method can be implemented using system or a variant thereof.

To assist with understanding method it will be discussed according to a possible implementation of method using system . To further assist with understanding method the following assumptions will be made about system . It will be assumed that 

c interface link are configured to operate using the 3G protocol and that base station and backhaul link are additionally configured to operate using a 3G protocol and

Element can therefore be any type of known network element that is consistent with a GSM network such as a HLR a VLR a MSC a SMSC or the like that operates according to the standards that govern GSM. Element can therefore be any type of known network element that is consistent with a EDGE access technology and protocol such as an HLR a VLR an MSC a SGSN a GGSN or the like that operates according to the standards that govern EDGE. Element can therefore be any type of known network element that is consistent with a 3G network such as an HLR a VLR an MSC a SGSN a GGSN a PCEF a PCRF a CSCF or the like that operates according to the 3G standard. Element can therefore be any type of known network element that is consistent with a UMA network such as an AAA server a UNC a PDG or the like that operates according to the standards that govern a UMA network.

It will also be assumed that the profile associated with subscriber S and device is defined to according the contents of Table I. In an embodiment the profile may be correlated with device profile P .

As previously noted shows a representation of system wherein Table I is stored on profile servers and in an embodiment the profile defined by Table I may be correlated with device profile P . also represents that links and are active as both links and are drawn in as interconnecting device and their respective base stations which is consistent with the permissions in Table I. also shows a representation that links and are inactive as both links and are drawn in as not interconnecting device and their respective base stations which is also consistent with the permissions in Table I.

Continuing now with the explanation of method block comprises the customer service representative CSR receiving a call or message from a subscriber S whereby the subscriber indicates that there may be an issue with one or more services the network or a device. The customer service representative CSR will solicit or request any incremental information from the subscriber in order to assist in the apparent issue as described by the subscriber S including but not limited to any identifiers associated with the subscriber or device e.g. Mobile Station ISDN or International Mobile Subscriber Identity or an identifier that is unique to the network operator .

Upon receiving sufficient information the customer service representative initiates method implemented in a present embodiment as a sub method comprising blocks and . The hashed box in labelled with reference represent that the blocks and collectively constitute a method of receiving the state and context of subscriber S or device receiving the network state and receiving the provisioned status of subscriber S or device including current device provisioning as well as the current provisioning of network infrastructure. Of note is that not all blocks of method need be performed in order to retrieve the data associated with sub method .

Block comprises receiving the state and context of subscriber S or device . In system block is performed by engine receiving state and context information about subscriber S or device . Such state and context information about subscriber S or device can be obtained by querying elements profile data servers network profile server network management server OSS BSS servers and diagnostic servers . Exemplary queries in an embodiment include retrieving the current subscription rate plan service and application profile information for subscriber S or device . Exemplary queries in an embodiment also include retrieving the active access technologies for a given subscriber S or device e.g. 2G 3G UMA which applications or services are active or resident on a device e.g. circuit switched voice instant messaging mobile TV the current location of subscriber S or device e.g. device is presently served by base station with associated geodetic coordinates device is presently located at WGS 84 coordinates 6 378 137.0 m semi major axis a 6 356 752.314 245 m semi minor axis b 298.257 223 563 inverse flattening which application servers are providing services to subscriber S or device e.g. element not shown an instant messaging server is supporting the instant messaging application resident on device . In the example shown in a query to diagnostic servers indicates that links and are active. In another example a query to network elements e.g. an HLR indicates that the device has registered on the network and has requested services to be provided via GSM and EDGE. In another example a query to profile servers indicates that one or more value added services e.g. instant messaging mobile TV associated with subscriber S or device are active or inactive as the case may be.

Block comprises receiving the network state including the state of the associated network infrastructure that is used to manage or provide services to the subscriber or device including network elements service delivery nodes content partners operational support systems business support systems bearer and transport systems as well as access technologies used to link the network to electronic devices. In system block is performed by engine receiving state information about mobile network from diagnostic servers directly or via network management server . In other embodiments engine can also receive state information about mobile network from elements or OSS BSS servers . In the example shown in diagnostic servers or network management server provides availability and status information about backhaul links . . . as well as the associated network infrastructure used to provide services to Subscriber S or device . For example a query to diagnostic servers or network management server would indicate the status and availability for network element not shown an instant messaging server that is supporting an instant messaging application resident on device .

Block comprises receiving the provisioned status of subscriber S or device including current device provisioning as well as the current provisioning of network infrastructure that manage or provide services to the subscriber or device including network elements service delivery nodes content partners operational support systems business support systems bearer and transport systems as well as access technologies used to link the mobile network to the device . In system block is performed by engine receiving provisioned status information for subscriber S or device from profile data servers or network profile server . In other embodiments engine can also receive subscriber S or device provisioned status information from OSS BSS servers . In the example shown in profile data servers or network profile server provide provisioned status information used to provide services to subscriber S or device . For example a query to profile data servers or network profile server indicates that the subscriber is subscribed to receive GSM and EDGE services and has an active subscription to an instant messaging service. As another example a query to profile data servers network profile server or OSS BSS servers indicates that the subscriber is associated with a pre paid account and application specific rate plan for the instant messaging service as well as a post paid account and associated rate plan for a number of GSM and EDGE services. In an embodiment the engine may query the history and usage patterns associated with subscriber S or device including the actions invoked using device and usage of network resources as typically indicated by event records generated or maintained by network elements service delivery nodes content partners operational support systems business support systems bearer and transport systems as well as access technologies used to link the mobile network to device . For example the engine may query profile data servers network profile server or OSS BSS servers and ascertain that subscriber S has exceeded the allocated volume of minutes or data associated with the subscriber s rate plan by more than 25 for the last three consecutive billing periods or that the subscriber S has repeatedly requested services that are not readily provided by the default access technologies e.g. mobile TV or Voice over IP via EDGE .

To the extent that a subscriber may be associated with multiple devices it should be understood that blocks and can be re performed for each device associated with subscriber S.

Block comprises determining whether the state and context of subscriber S or device from block the network state from block and the provisioned status of subscriber S or device from block are consistent. If yes then method advances from block to block where an indication is provided to the customer service representative CSR that the profile associated with subscriber S and device is consistent with the provisioned state of the network. In the example in a yes determination would be made at block because a the state and context of subscriber S or device including the status of the available network interfaces and links are consistent with the available backhaul links and device has registered with mobile network and the requested services are consistent with the capabilities provided by mobile network b the associated network infrastructure including links and and network elements are active and available or operational for the purpose of providing the subscribed or requested services for subscriber S or device and c the provisioned status associated with subscriber S or device is consistent with the state and context of subscriber S or device as well as the network state associated with network infrastructure used to provide services to subscriber S or device e.g. the network is capable of providing GSM and EDGE services to device via backhaul links and the instant messaging server is active and can support the instant messaging service resident on device via backhaul link .

In an embodiment at block the customer service representative may optionally proactively apply or reaffirm provisioned states in network elements OSS BSS servers profile servers directly or via network profile server using engine . In an embodiment at block upon instruction by the customer service representative CSR engine may optionally proactively apply or reaffirm provisioned states for device in profile P to comply with the provisioned state of the mobile network .

To the extent that a subscriber may be associated with multiple devices it should be understood that blocks can be re performed for each device associated with subscriber S.

Upon completion of block method returns to block where method begins anew or alternatively method terminates with the customer service representative CSR and subscriber S achieving consensus that there is no apparent issue that can be resolved by modifying the provisioned state of the subscriber device or mobile network. To the extent that the method is effectively terminated by the termination of the call or message sequence method can be invoked to proactively monitor for and resolve discrepancies between the state and context of the subscriber and device the state of the network and the provisioned state of the subscriber device and network.

As previously noted shows another set of assumptions about system wherein various links that are available to subscriber S or device are NOT consistent with the profile according to Table I that is associated with subscriber S or device . Of note is that in backhaul links and are disabled for whatever reason and therefore base stations and are not connected to core network essentially rendering links and unavailable to subscriber S or device .

Thus when blocks are performed using the assumptions in a No determination is made at block . More specifically in the example in a No determination would be made at block because a the state and context of subscriber S or device including the status of the available network interfaces are not consistent with the disabled backhaul links and device has effectively deregistered with mobile network and previously requested services cannot be provided by mobile network b a subset of the associated network infrastructure including links and are inactive otherwise not operational for the purpose of providing the subscribed or requested services for subscriber S or device and c the provisioned status associated with subscriber S or device is not consistent with the state and context of subscriber S or device as well as the network state associated with network infrastructure used to provide services to subscriber S or device e.g. the network is not capable of providing GSM and EDGE services to device via backhaul links and the instant messaging server is active and cannot support the instant messaging service resident on device via disabled backhaul link . Furthermore at block an update of the network state indicates that while links and are unavailable that link is available and that link is available. Thus at block a determination is made that the state and context of subscriber S or device from block the network state from block and the provisioned status of subscriber S or device from block are NOT consistent and therefore a No determination is made at block .

Block comprises the indication to the customer service representative CSR that the profile associated with the subscriber S or device is not consistent with the provisioned state. Engine will determine and display one or more alternative provisioned states provisioning for subscriber S device or mobile network . In the example of an alternative provisioning for subscriber S or device can be determined so that UMA connectivity is provided to device via link base station and backhaul link as well as any other relevant network elements associated with core network . Specifically at block a modified provisioned state that uses UMA connectivity would be determined as a the requested services associated with subscriber S or device are consistent with capabilities provided with mobile network using UMA connectivity for example voice and instant messaging services can be provided using UMA connectivity b the network infrastructure associated with UMA connectivity including link base station and backhaul link as well as any other relevant network elements associated with core network are active and available or operational for the purpose of providing the subscribed or requested services for subscriber S or device and c the alternative provisioned state for the subscriber S device and mobile network would result in a state and context for subscriber S and device that is relatively consistent with the default state and context for subscriber S and device in the context of the default services and applications which would otherwise be made available to subscriber S or device prior to the transient events that caused one or more disruptions within mobile network for example voice and instant messaging services can be provided using UMA connectivity .

Block comprises the customer service representative selecting the preferred alternative provisioning state and instructing engine to execute the provisioning of the selected alternative state.

Block comprises provisioning the subscriber S device and mobile network according to the alternative provisioning from block . represents this exemplary performance of block wherein device is shown in communication with core network via link base station and backhaul link . At block engine will update the provisioned state associated with subscriber S device and mobile network in network elements OSS BSS servers profile servers directly or via network profile server . In an embodiment at block engine may optionally apply new provisioned states for device in profile P to comply with the provisioned state of the mobile network . For example in the case of UMA connectivity this may include the activation of the associated network interface and configuration of various firewall settings in profile P . In an embodiment engine can access OSS BSS servers to provision a new price plan relating to a new provisioned state in the mobile network for example a reduced tariff may be applied in connection with any potential inconvenience that may be associated with the new provisioned state for the subscriber S device or mobile network . As another example engine can access OSS BSS servers for the purpose of applying a credit value which can be applied to the subscriber s S or device s pre paid or post paid balance or account as the case may be.

Block which is optional comprises sending one or messages indicating the alternative provisioning. One such message can be sent directly to subscriber S or device indicating for example We apologize that your regular GSM EDGE service has been disrupted. We are temporarily routing your communications via a UMA connection until regular GSM EDGE service is restored. An additional message can be sent to subscriber S or device indicating that a credit e.g. air time or other non monetary credit or currency or other monetary credit is being applied to an account associated with subscriber S or device to compensate for the service disruption. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the customer service representative CSR can also convey the outcome to the subscriber verbally.

To the extent that a subscriber may be associated with multiple devices it should be understood that blocks and can be re performed for each device associated with subscriber S. Of note the alternative network provisioning state determined and applied via blocks and can be unique to each device or set to the same provisioned alternative state subject to the subscriber and device state and context received for each device via block .

Method then advances from block to block where the customer service representative CSR can solicit an additional query from the subscriber S or alternatively the customer service representative or subscriber can terminate the call. To the extent that the method is effectively terminated by the termination of the call method can be invoked to proactively monitor for and resolve discrepancies between the state and context of the subscriber and device the state of the network and the provisioned state of the subscriber device and network.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the involvement of the subscriber S and the CSR in the foregoing description is for illustrative purposes to demonstrate how subscribers S and CSR can interact with the novel and inventive technical features of engine and the other components herein.

It is again to be reiterated that the examples above are simplified. Table II shows a more complex example of a profile for subscriber S or device .

Thus an examination of Table II shows more complex criteria regarding the profile for subscriber S or device including roaming privileges rates and data types. Thus when method or method is performed using the profile in Table II a greater number of considerations are required to establish consistency at block block . Further if consistency is not found at block block then various ones of the restrictions in Table II can be ignored so as to permit device to function in a manner that is substantially consistent with the profile in Table II.

Thus for example assume Service Identity 1 from Table II was not available because of for example a temporarily failure of a GSM base station that was reachable by device but that an 3G base station was available to device via interface . Then when engine performs method or method alternative provisioning can be established at block method so that device can during the outage of the GSM base station access the 3G base station for voice telephone calls at the rate 20 cents per minute for voice calls associated with Service Identity 1 from Table II rather than rather than being denied voice call access to 3G base station and charging the account associated with device in accordance with the 10 per month rate normally associated with Service Identity 5 from Table II. Alternatively when engine performs method or method alternative provisioning can be established at block block so that device can during the outage of the GSM base station access the UMA base station for voice telephone calls at the rate 20 cents per minute associated with Service Identity 1 from Table II rather than being denied voice call access to UMA base station altogether in accordance with Service Identity 8 from Table II. Numerous other examples of alternative provisioning according to block block will now occur to those of skill in the art.
