The present invention relates to a toner for electrophotography usable in for example developing latent images formed in electrophotography electrostatic recording method electrostatic printing method or the like and a resin binder for use in such a toner.

In the recent years with the advancement of speeding up of the machines and energy conservation a toner having excellent low temperature fixing ability is required. In view of the above as a resin binder for use in a toner a polycondensation resin in which an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol is used is proposed in place of a conventionally used polycondensation resin obtainable from an aromatic polyhydric alcohol.

Patent Publication 1 discloses a toner for electrostatic image development in which as a resin binder a polyester resin obtainable by reacting an alcohol component containing 1 3 propanediol and a specified other polyhydric alcohol as essential constituents and a polybasic acid component is used the toner having excellent fixing ability and offset resistance showing stable charging behavior even when subjected to continuous printing and having excellent durability so that an excellent high quality image is obtained.

Patent Publication 2 discloses a polyester resin for a toner in which a polyester resin obtainable from a polyol component containing 30 to 100 by mol of an aliphatic diol having 2 to 6 carbon atoms at least a part of the aliphatic diol being 1 2 propylene glycol is used wherein a tetrahydrofuran soluble component has a number average molecular weight of from 1 000 to 9 500 for the purpose of providing a toner having excellent balance between low temperature fixing ability and pulverizability and excellent gloss after fusing.

For example Patent Publication 3 discloses a toner for electrostatic image development wherein the polyester contains a high softening point polyester having a softening point of from 120 to 160 C. and a low softening point polyester having a softening point of from 75 to 120 C. each obtained by polycondensing an alcohol component consisting essentially of an aliphatic alcohol and a carboxylic acid component wherein a difference in the softening points between the high softening point polyester and the low softening point polyester is 10 C. or more.

Patent Publication 4 discloses a method for producing a resin binder having excellent triboelectric charges and environmental stability of the image quality favorable pulverizability and transparency and being fixable at low temperatures characterized by previously mixing a raw material monomer mixtures of two polymerization system each having independent reaction paths in a single reaction vessel b a compound capable of reacting with the raw materials of both the two polymerization systems and c a tricarboxylic or higher polycarboxylic acid or a derivative thereof and concurrently carrying out the two polymerization reactions in the same reaction vessel.

In addition Patent Publication 5 discloses a resin binder for a toner having excellent low temperature fixing ability environmental stability and blocking resistance the resin binder for a toner containing crystalline polyester and amorphous polyester resins wherein the crystalline polyester is obtainable by polycondensing an alcohol component containing 70 by mol or more of an aliphatic diol having 2 to 8 carbon atoms and a carboxylic acid component containing 70 by mol or more of an aromatic dicarboxylic acid compound.

As resin binders for a toner styrene acrylic resins polyesters epoxy resins and the like have been used and polycondensation resins such as polyesters are beginning to be widely used because of their excellent low temperature fixing ability. Patent Publication 6 makes various studies on catalyst usable in the production of a polyester.

Patent Publications 7 and 8 disclose the techniques of adding as a charge control agent a charge control resin CCR having excellent triboelectric property.

Patent Publication 9 discloses a toner for electrophotography containing toner particles and at least two kinds of external additives having specified average particle sizes for the purpose of simultaneous improving transfer efficiency while maintaining high resolution and optical density and stabilizing fluidity of the toner.

Conventionally a styrene acrylic resin or a polyester is known as a resin binder for a toner and a toner containing a polyester is widely used because of its excellent durability and fixing ability. As the toner as described above Patent Publication 10 discloses a polyester containing as a carboxylic acid component an alkylsuccinic acid and or alkenylsuccinic acid having 10 or more carbon atoms especially from the viewpoint of fixing ability and a toner obtained by a melt kneading pulverization method using the polyester as a resin binder. In addition Patent Publication 11 discloses a toner for electrophotography containing a resin binder containing a composite resin having a polycondensation resin unit and an addition polymerization resin unit the toner being obtained by melt pulverization method wherein the polycondensation resin unit has a constituting unit derived from a carboxylic acid component containing at least two kinds of alkylsuccinic acid of which alkyl group is branched and has 9 to 14 carbon atoms.

On the other hand in the recent years with the pursuit of formation of high quality images the development of a toner having a small particle size the toner having excellent fixing ability is desired. However in a case where a toner having a small particle size the toner containing a resin binder containing a polyester as a main component is produced by a melt kneading and pulverization method it is difficult to control the pulverization. In view of the above for example Patent Publication 12 discloses a method for producing a toner according to an emulsification aggregation method which is a wet production method using a resin binder having a carboxyl group.

Patent Publication 13 discloses a polyester having excellent hydrolytic resistance usable in the production of a toner including the step of forming particles from raw material components containing a resin binder containing at least a polyester in an aqueous medium or a solution the polyester being obtainable by polycondensing an alcohol component and a carboxylic acid component containing at least one member selected from alkylsuccinic acids and alkenylsuccinic acids and a polyester for use in a toner for electrophotography having excellent storage property and fixing ability containing the above polyester.

Patent Publication 14 discloses as an objective of providing a toner for electrophotography having excellent storage property and durability a toner for electrophotography obtainable by a method including the step of forming particles from raw materials containing a resin binder and a polyolefin wax and or a paraffin wax wherein the resin binder contains a resin obtainable from at least raw material monomers for a polycondensation resin and raw material monomers for an addition polymerization resin.

The present invention relates to a toner for electrophotography having storage property while satisfying excellent low temperature fixing ability and a resin binder for use in such a toner.

The toner for electrophotography of the present invention also exhibits an effect of showing excellent storage property while satisfying excellent low temperature fixing ability.

The polycondensation resin obtainable from an aliphatic alcohol has excellent low temperature fixing ability but insufficient storage property. Especially the toners are likely to suffer from not only heat generation in the machine but also temperature elevation in the container due to direct sunlight during the transportation so that storage property is an essential property for toners. However an increase in storage property would inevitably lead to the risk of low temperature fixing ability so that the development of a resin binder for use in a toner having excellent low temperature fixing ability and storage property which are counteractive properties.

A major feature of the resin binder for use in a toner for electrophotography of the present invention resides in that the resin binder contains a polycondensation resin obtainable by polycondensing as raw material monomers 

an alcohol component containing at least an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having two or more secondary carbon atoms with a hydroxyl group bound thereto an alcohol A and

The polycondensation resin obtained from the aliphatic polyhydric alcohol is likely to have a higher ester value as compared to the case where the polycondensation resin is obtained from an aromatic polyhydric alcohol such as a generally used alkylene oxide of bisphenol A so that the polycondensation resin is effective in improving low temperature fixing ability from the viewpoint of affinity with paper. On the other hand in a state where a molecular backbone is flexible and the molecular weight is not likely to noticeably increased it is difficult to increase a glass transition temperature whereby leading to the lowering in storage property. In the present invention however it is made possible to improve low temperature fixing ability without impairing storage property by using an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having a specified structure mentioned above. One of the causes therefor is presumably due to the fact that an alkyl group bound to a secondary carbon with a hydroxyl group bound thereto leads to restrain a molecular motion so that the resulting resin binder has a higher glass transition temperature as compared to those resins having softening points of the same level.

The aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having two or more secondary carbon atoms with a hydroxyl group bound thereto an alcohol A includes 2 3 butanediol 2 3 pentanediol 2 4 pentanediol 2 3 hexanediol 3 4 hexanediol 2 4 hexanediol 2 5 hexanediol and the like.

The alcohol A has preferably 4 to 8 carbon atoms more preferably 4 to 5 carbon atoms and even more preferably 4 carbon atoms from the viewpoint of increasing an ester value and also increasing storage property as well as low temperature fixing ability of the toner. In addition an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having one or more sets of secondary carbon atoms the secondary carbon atoms with a hydroxyl group bound thereto being adjacent to each other is more preferred from the viewpoint of making the backbone of the main chain of the resin rigid thereby increasing storage property. From these viewpoints an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having 4 to 8 carbon atoms which has one or more sets of secondary carbon atoms the secondary carbon atoms with a hydroxyl group bound thereto being adjacent to each other such as 2 3 butanediol 2 3 pentanediol 2 3 hexanediol or 3 4 hexanediol is more preferred.

The alcohol A is contained in an amount of from 10 to 100 by mol preferably from 12 to 80 by mol and more preferably from 25 to 75 by mol of the alcohol component from the viewpoint of low temperature fixing ability and storage property of the toner.

In addition the amount of the alcohol A used upon the polycondensation of the alcohol component and the carboxylic acid component is preferably from 6 to 100 parts by weight more preferably from 10 to 90 parts by weight and even more preferably from 15 to 80 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of a total amount of the alcohol component other than the alcohol A and the carboxylic acid component which are the raw material monomers for the polycondensation resin from the viewpoint of low temperature fixing ability storage property and optical density under high temperature high humidity conditions of the toner.

In Embodiment I 1 it is preferable that the alcohol component further contains other than the alcohol A an aliphatic diol having 2 to 8 carbons atoms and preferably 2 to 6 carbons atoms an alcohol B from the viewpoint of low temperature fixing ability of the toner. The alcohol B includes ethylene glycol 1 2 propanediol 1 3 propanediol 1 4 butanediol 1 5 pentanediol 1 6 hexanediol 1 4 butenediol 1 3 butanediol neopentyl glycol and the like. Among them ethylene glycol 1 2 propanediol and 1 3 propanediol are preferred from the viewpoint of storage property of the toner.

The alcohol B is contained in an amount of preferably from 0 to 90 by mol more preferably from 0.5 to 90 by mol even more preferably from 20 to 88 by mol and still even more preferably from 25 to 75 by mol of the alcohol component from the viewpoint of increasing low temperature fixing ability of the toner.

In addition the alcohol B is contained in an amount of preferably 10 mol or less preferably from 0.1 to 5 mol and more preferably from 0.3 to 3 mol per one mol of the alcohol A from the viewpoint of low temperature fixing ability and storage property of the toner.

The alcohol component other than the alcohol A and the alcohol B includes aromatic diols such as an alkylene oxide adduct of bisphenol represented by the formula I 

wherein RO and OR are an oxyalkylene group wherein R is an ethylene group and or a propylene group and each of x and y is a positive number showing an average number of moles of alkylene oxide added wherein an average number of the sum of x and y is preferably from 1 to 16 more preferably from 1 to 8 and even more preferably from 1.5 to 4 such as polyoxypropylene 2 2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane and polyoxyethylene 2 2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane trihydric or higher polyhydric alcohols such as glycerol and the like.

The aromatic diol is contained in an amount of preferably 10 by mol or less and more preferably 5 by mol or less of the alcohol component from the viewpoint of low temperature fixing ability of the toner and it is preferable that substantially no aromatic diol is used. Here substantially no aromatic diol is used refers to an aromatic diol that is contained in an amount of 0 by mol or if any 1 by mol or less of the alcohol component.

In addition it is preferable that the carboxylic acid component contains at least one succinic acid derivative selected from alkyl 9 to 14 carbon atoms succinic acids and alkenyl 9 to 14 carbon atoms succinic acids from the viewpoint of increasing low temperature fixing ability and optical density under high temperature high humidity conditions. Here the succinic acid derivative may be an anhydride or a lower alkyl ester having 1 to 3 carbon atoms of an alkyl 9 to 14 carbon atoms succinic acid or an alkenyl 9 to 14 carbon atoms succinic acid.

Since a polycondensation resin obtained from an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol has high hygroscopicity the polycondensation resin is insufficient in optical density under high temperature high humidity conditions meanwhile by further using a succinic acid derivative having a long chain hydrocarbon group the succinic acid derivative having high hydrophobicity together therewith as the carboxylic acid component the lowering of optical density under high temperature high humidity conditions is also improved while maintaining low temperature fixing ability and storage property. The reason why the lowering of optical density under high temperature high humidity conditions is improved is presumably due to the fact that an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having a specified mentioned structure above has an alkyl group at a terminal so that hydrophilicity near the ester groups is suppressed and that at the same time a succinic acid derivative having a long chain hydrocarbon group the succinic acid derivative having high hydrophobicity is used so that hygroscopicity is lowered.

The number of carbon atoms in the alkyl group or the alkenyl group in the alkylsuccinic acid and the alkenylsuccinic acid is from 9 to 14 and preferably from 10 to 12 from the viewpoint of increasing low temperature fixing ability storage property and optical density under high temperature high humidity conditions of the toner.

Further it is preferable that the succinic acid derivative is one comprising two or more members selected from the group consisting of alkylsuccinic acids having a branched alkyl group of 9 to 14 carbon atoms and alkenylsuccinic acids having a branched alkenyl group of 9 to 14 carbon atoms from the viewpoint of increasing low temperature fixing ability and optical density under high temperature high humidity conditions of the toner. Therefore the succinic acid derivative is preferably one comprising two or more alkylsuccinic acids having a branched alkyl group of 9 to 14 carbon atoms or one comprising two or more alkenylsuccinic acids having a branched alkenyl group of 9 to 14 carbon atoms or one comprising one or more of each of the above mentioned alkylsuccinic acids and the above mentioned alkenylsuccinic acids.

By using succinic acid derivatives having branched alkyl groups and or alkenyl groups with different numbers of carbon atoms in combination the resulting resins have a broad endothermic peak near a glass transition temperature in accordance with the differential scanning calorimetry DSC so that the resins have very wide fixing temperature regions as a resin binder for use in a toner.

In the present invention it is preferable that the alcohol component containing an alcohol A and the carboxylic acid component are polycondensed in the presence of an esterification catalyst and a pyrogallol compound having a benzene ring of which three hydrogen atoms adjacent to each other are substituted by hydroxyl groups. The polycondensation resin obtained from the alcohol A is more likely to cause deposition of the toner on a developer roller thereby lowering durability. The reasons therefor are considered to be as follows a resin binder obtained from the aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having two or more secondary carbon atoms has low reactivity as compared to those resin binders obtained from the other aliphatic polyhydric alcohols or aromatic polyhydric alcohols so that the resin binder contains a large amount of low molecular weight components which is likely to deposit on the developer roller. However in the present invention the polycondensation reaction of the alcohol component and the carboxylic acid component is carried out in the presence of an esterification catalyst and a pyrogallol compound so that the reactivity of the raw material monomers is improved and the low molecular weight components in the resulting resin are reduced thereby improving the durability.

is preferable from the viewpoint of durability of the resin obtained. In the formula the hydrocarbon group of Rhas preferably 1 to 8 carbon atoms and more preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms from the viewpoint of reaction activity. Among the compounds represented by the formula II a compound where each of Rand Ris a hydrogen atom and Ris a hydrogen atom or COORis more preferable.

It is considered that the pyrogallol compound acts as a promoter for the esterification catalyst.

Among the metal catalysts mentioned above the tin compounds are preferred from the viewpoint of having high reactivity thereby producing a resin having excellent durability.

The esterification catalyst is present in an amount of preferably from 0.01 to 2.0 parts by weight more preferably from 0.1 to 1.5 parts by weight and even more preferably from 0.2 to 1.0 part by weight based on 100 parts by weight of a total amount of the alcohol component and the carboxylic acid component. Here the amount of the esterification catalyst present as referred to herein means an entire formulation amount of the catalysts used in the polycondensation reaction.

The weight ratio of the pyrogallol compound to the esterification catalyst pyrogallol compound esterification catalyst is preferably from 0.01 to 0.5 more preferably from 0.03 to 0.3 and even more preferably from 0.05 to 0.2 from the viewpoint of durability of the resin.

It is preferable that the polycondensation reaction of the alcohol component and the carboxylic acid component using the pyrogallol compound is carried out at a temperature of from 180 to 250 C. in an inert gas atmosphere in the presence of an esterification catalyst and a pyrogallol compound and as occasion demands a polymerization inhibitor or the like. The esterification catalyst and the pyrogallol compound may be previously mixed and added to a reaction system or they may be separately added. Alternatively the esterification catalyst and the pyrogallol compound may be added by previously mixing with a carboxylic acid component or an alcohol component. The timing of adding the esterification catalyst and the pyrogallol compound to a reaction system may be either before the initiation of reaction or during the course of the reaction. It is preferable that the esterification catalyst and the pyrogallol compound are added at a time point before the reaction temperature is reached from the viewpoint of obtaining an even more enhanced effect in the promotion of the polycondensation reaction and it is more preferable that these components are added before the initiation of the reaction. In the present invention before the initiation of the reaction as referred to herein means a state in which water accompanying the polycondensation reaction is not yet generated.

The polycondensation resin of Embodiment I 1 includes polyesters polyester polyamides and the like. Among them the polyesters are preferred from the viewpoint of durability and triboelectric chargeability of the toner.

Here the polyester may contain a polyester modified to an extent that the properties are substantially not impaired.

The raw material monomers for forming an amide component include various polyamines aminocarboxylic acids amino alcohols and the like that are known in the art.

Since the polycondensation resin obtained from an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol has a high ester value the polycondensation resin is more likely to absorb water under high temperature high humidity conditions which in turn lead to insufficient triboelectric stability under high temperature high humidity conditions. In Embodiment I 2 however it is presumed that the aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having a specified structure mentioned above has an alkyl group at a terminal so that hydrophilicity near the ester group is suppressed and at the same time a hydrophobic styrenic resin is contained so that hygroscopicity is lowered thereby maintaining excellent triboelectric stability.

As the raw material monomers for the polycondensation resin at least an alcohol component containing an alcohol A and a carboxylic acid component are used.

The alcohol A is contained in an amount of preferably from 10 to 100 by mol more preferably from 12 to 80 by mol and even more preferably from 25 to 75 by mol of the alcohol component of the polycondensation resin from the viewpoint of low temperature fixing ability and storage property of the toner.

Other acids includes rosins rosins modified with fumaric acid maleic acid or acrylic acid and the like.

It is desirable that the carboxylic acid component contains a tricarboxylic or higher polycarboxylic acid compound preferably a trimellitic acid compound and more preferably trimellitic anhydride from the viewpoint of elevating molecular weight of the resin and increasing low temperature fixing ability and storage property of the toner.

The polycondensation resin includes polyesters polyester polyamides and the like in the same manner as in Embodiment I 1 from the viewpoint of low temperature fixing ability of the toner. Among them polyesters are preferred from the viewpoint of the durability and triboelectric chargeability. The polyester may be a polyester modified to an extent that the properties are substantially not impaired.

Meanwhile as the raw material monomers for a styrenic resin a styrenic derivative such as styrene methylstyrene or vinyltoluene is used.

The styrenic derivative is contained in an amount of preferably 50 by weight or more more preferably 70 by weight or more and even more preferably 80 by weight or more of the raw material monomers for a styrenic resin.

The raw material monomers for a styrenic resin that are usable other than the styrenic derivative include alkyl meth acrylate esters ethylenically unsaturated monoolefins such as ethylene and propylene diolefins such as butadiene halovinyls such as vinyl chloride vinyl esters such as vinyl acetate and vinyl propionate ethylenically monocarboxylate esters such as dimethylaminoethyl meth acrylate vinyl ethers such as vinyl methyl ether vinylidene halides such as vinylidene chloride N vinyl compounds such as N vinylpyrrolidone and the like. The term meth acrylic acid as used herein means acrylic acid and or methacrylic acid.

Among them the alkyl meth acrylate ester is preferred from the viewpoint of low temperature fixing ability and triboelectric stability of the toner. The alkyl group in the alkyl meth acrylate ester has preferably 1 to 22 carbon atoms and more preferably 8 to 18 carbon atoms from the viewpoint mentioned above. Here the number of carbon atoms of the alkyl ester refers to the number of carbon atoms derived from the alcohol component moiety constituting the ester.

The expression iso or tert or iso embrace both a case where these groups are present and a case where the groups are absent and the case where the groups are absent means normal. Also the expression meth acrylate means that both cases of acrylate and methacrylate are included.

The alkyl meth acrylate ester is contained in an amount of preferably 50 by weight or less more preferably 30 by weight or less and even more preferably 20 by weight or less of the raw material monomers for a styrenic resin from the viewpoint of low temperature fixing ability storage property and triboelectric stability of the toner.

Here a resin obtained by addition polymerization of raw material monomers containing a styrenic derivative and an alkyl meth acrylate ester is also referred to as a styrene meth acrylate resin.

The addition polymerization reaction of the raw material monomers for a styrenic resin can be carried out by a conventional method for example in the presence of a polymerization initiator a crosslinking agent and the like in an organic solvent or without any solvents. The temperature conditions are preferably from 110 to 200 C. and more preferably from 140 to 170 C.

The organic solvent that is usable in the addition polymerization reaction includes xylene toluene methyl ethyl ketone acetone and the like. It is preferable that the organic solvent is used in an amount of from 10 to 50 parts by weight or so based on 100 parts by weight of the raw material monomers for a styrenic resin.

The composite resin may be any resin that contains a polycondensation resin and a styrenic resin which may be a mixture of a polycondensation resin and a styrenic resin. It is preferable that a composite resin is a resin obtainable by polymerizing raw material monomers for a polycondensation resin and raw material monomers for a styrenic resin. The composite resin can be obtained for example by concurrently or sequentially carrying out a polycondensation reaction of raw material monomers for a polycondensation resin and an addition polymerization reaction of raw material monomers for a styrenic resin in the same reaction vessel. The progress and the termination of the polycondensation reaction and the addition polymerization reaction are not necessarily concurrent with respect to time and the reaction temperature and time may be appropriately selected depending upon each of the reaction mechanisms for progressing and terminating the reaction.

Further it is preferable that the composite resin is a hybrid resin obtainable by using in addition to the raw material monomers for a polycondensation resin and the raw material monomers for a styrenic resin a compound capable of reacting with both of the raw material monomers dually reactive monomer from the viewpoint of improving low temperature fixing ability and triboelectric stability of the toner. Therefore when a composite resin is obtained by polymerizing the raw material monomers for a polycondensation resin and the raw material monomers for a styrenic resin it is preferable that the polycondensation reaction and the addition polymerization reaction are carried out in the presence of a dually reactive monomer whereby the composite resin would be a hybrid resin in which the polycondensation resin and the styrenic resin are partly bonded via the dually reactive monomer thereby allowing the styrenic resin component to be more finely and homogeneously dispersed in the polycondensation resin component.

It is preferable that the dually reactive monomer is a compound having in its molecule an ethylenically unsaturated bond and at least one functional group selected from the group consisting of a hydroxyl group a carboxyl group an epoxy group a primary amino group and a secondary amino group preferably a hydroxyl group and or a carboxyl group and more preferably a carboxyl group. By using the dually reactive monomer as described above dispersibility of the resin forming a dispersed phase can be even more improved. It is preferable that the dually reactive monomer is at least one member selected from the group consisting of acrylic acid methacrylic acid fumaric acid maleic acid and maleic anhydride and acrylic acid methacrylic acid and fumaric acid are more preferred from the viewpoint of the reactivity.

The dually reactive monomer is contained in an amount of preferably from 1 to 20 by mol and more preferably from 2 to 15 by mol of a total amount of the alcohol component and the carboxylic acid component of the polycondensation resin.

 i a method including the steps of A carrying out of a polycondensation reaction and thereafter B carrying out an addition polymerization reaction 

 ii a method including the steps of A carrying out of a polycondensation reaction thereafter B carrying out an addition polymerization reaction again raising a reaction temperature after the step B and as occasion demands adding to the polymerization systems a trivalent or higher polyvalent raw material monomer for a polycondensation resin which serves as a crosslinking agent to further progress with the polycondensation reaction of the step A iii a method including the steps of carrying out concurrently the steps of A carrying out a polycondensation reaction and B carrying out an addition polymerization reaction under the temperature conditions appropriate for the addition polymerization reaction keeping a reaction temperature under the conditions mentioned above to complete the step B raising the reaction temperature and as occasion demands adding to the polymerization system a trivalent or higher polyvalent raw material monomer for the polycondensation resin which serves as a crosslinking agent to further progress with the polycondensation reaction of the step A and the like. In the methods i and ii a polycondensation resin that is previously polymerized may be used in place of carrying out the step of A carrying out a polycondensation reaction. In the method of iii when the step A and the step B are concurrently carried out the reaction can be also carried out by adding a mixture containing raw material monomers for a styrenic resin dropwise to a mixture containing raw material monomers for a polycondensation resin.

In addition in a case where a composite resin is a hybrid resin obtainable from a dually reactive monomer it is preferable that the dually reactive monomer is used together with raw material monomers for a styrenic resin.

The weight ratio of the polycondensation resin to the styrenic resin in other words a weight ratio of the raw material monomers for a polycondensation resin to the raw material monomers for a styrenic resin i.e. raw material monomers for a polycondensation resin raw material monomers for a styrenic resin is preferably from 55 45 to 95 5 more preferably from 60 40 to 95 5 and even more preferably from 70 30 to 90 10 because it is preferable that a continuous phase comprises the polycondensation resin and a dispersed phase comprises the styrenic resin.

In both of Embodiment I 1 and Embodiment I 2 the resin binder has a softening point of preferably from 90 to 160 C. more preferably from 95 to 155 C. and even more preferably from 115 to 150 C. from the viewpoint of low temperature fixing ability storage property and durability of the toner.

In general a softening point and a glass transition temperature of a resin are correlated. However the resin binder in Embodiment I 1 and Embodiment I 2 can have a higher glass transition temperature as compared to resins having the same level of softening points so that even a single kind of a resin can satisfy low temperature fixing ability storage property and the like of the toner. By using a resin having a higher softening point and a resin having a lower softening point in combination the resulting toner has more excellent properties from the viewpoint mentioned above. Specifically from the viewpoint mentioned above it is preferable that the resin binder comprises a high softening point resin and a low softening point resin the softening points of which have a difference of preferably 10 C. or more and more preferably from 20 to 60 C. The high softening point resin has a softening point of preferably from 125 to 160 C. and more preferably from 130 to 150 C. and the low softening point resin has a softening point of preferably from 90 to 120 C. and more preferably from 90 to 110 C. The weight ratio of the high softening point resin to the low softening point resin i.e. high softening point resin low softening point resin is preferably from 1 3 to 3 1 and more preferably from 1 2 to 2 1.

In addition the resin binder in Embodiment I 1 and Embodiment I 2 has a glass transition temperature of preferably from 45 to 85 C. more preferably from 50 to 80 C. and even more preferably from 58 to 75 C. from the viewpoint of low temperature fixing ability storage property and durability of the toner. The resin binder has an acid value of preferably from 1 to 90 mgKOH g more preferably from 5 to 90 mgKOH g and even more preferably from 5 to 88 mgKOH g from the viewpoint of triboelectric chargeability and environmental stability of the toner.

A feature of the resin binder of Embodiment I 3 is that the resin binder contains an amorphous resin and a crystalline resin and that an alcohol A is used as an alcohol component at least in either one of the resins. In general a crystalline resin is effective for improving low temperature fixing ability meanwhile when a crystalline resin is used together with an amorphous resin storage property is likely to be lowered due to the compatibility therebetween. In Embodiment I 3 however excellent low temperature fixing ability is exhibited without impairing storage property of the toner. One of the factors therefor is presumably due to the fact that an alkyl group bound to the secondary carbon with a hydroxyl group bound thereto constrains molecular motion so that excessive compatibility between the crystalline resin and the amorphous resin is controlled.

The crystallinity of the resin is expressed by a ratio of a softening point to a temperature of the maximum endothermic peak determined with a differential scanning calorimeter i.e. a ratio expressed by softening point temperature of the maximum endothermic peak. Generally when this value exceeds 1.4 the resin is amorphous and when the value is less than 0.6 the resin is low in crystallinity and mostly amorphous. The crystallinity of the resin can be adjusted by the kinds of the raw material monomers and a ratio thereof production conditions for example reaction temperature reaction time and cooling rate and the like. In the present invention the term crystalline resin refers to a resin having a value of softening point temperature of the maximum endothermic peak temperature of the maximum endothermic peak of from 0.6 to 1.4 and preferably from 0.8 to 1.2 and the term amorphous resin refers to a resin having a value of softening point temperature of the maximum endothermic peak of more than 1.4 or less than 0.6 and preferably more than 1.4. Here the temperature of the maximum endothermic peak refers to a temperature of the peak on the higher temperature side among endothermic peaks observed. When a difference between the temperature of the maximum endothermic peak and the softening point is within 20 C. the temperature of the maximum endothermic peak is defined as a melting point. When the difference between the temperature of the maximum endothermic peak and the softening point exceeds 20 C. the peak is ascribed to a glass transition. Here in Embodiment I 3 when simply referred to as a resin it is intended to mean both the crystalline resin and the amorphous resin. Similarly in Embodiment I 3 when simply referred to as a polycondensation resin it is intended to mean both the crystalline polycondensation resin and the amorphous polycondensation resin.

In Embodiment I 3 as mentioned above at least either one of the amorphous resin and the crystalline resin is a resin obtained from the alcohol A. It is preferable that both of the crystalline resin and the amorphous resin are a resin that contains a polycondensation resin obtained from the alcohol A from the viewpoint of storage property of the toner. Here the amorphous resin may be a composite resin containing a polycondensation resin and an addition polymerization resin as described later.

The alcohol A may be used at least in either one of the amorphous resin and the crystalline resin as mentioned above. It is preferable that the alcohol A is used in the amorphous resin from the viewpoint of storage property of the toner and it is more preferable that the alcohol A is used in both of the amorphous resin and the crystalline resin from the viewpoint of storage property and low temperature fixing ability of the toner.

A resin obtained from an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol has a high ester value so that the resin is likely to absorb water under high temperature high humidity conditions which in turn leads to insufficient triboelectric stability under high temperature high humidity conditions. Therefore it is preferable that the amorphous resin is one or more resins selected from the group consisting of

 a a polycondensation resin obtainable by polycondensing a carboxylic acid component containing at least one succinic acid derivative selected from alkyl 9 to 14 carbon atoms succinic acids and alkenyl 9 to 14 carbon atoms succinic acids and an alcohol component and b a composite resin containing a polycondensation resin and a styrenic resin from the viewpoint of also having excellent triboelectric stability under high temperature high humidity conditions. This is presumably due to the fact that the aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having a specified structure mentioned above has an alkyl group at a terminal hydrophilicity near the ester groups is suppressed and that at the same time the resin binder contains at least either one of a polycondensation resin obtained from a succinic acid derivative having hydrophobicity or a composite resin containing the polycondensation resin and a styrenic resin having high hydrophobicity so that the toner does not become hygroscopic even under high temperature high humidity conditions whereby excellent triboelectric stability can be maintained.

In Embodiment I 3 it is preferable that the crystalline resin is a polycondensation resin and it is more preferable that the crystalline resin is a polycondensation resin obtainable by polycondensing an alcohol component containing an alcohol A and a carboxylic acid component. In addition the amorphous resin is preferably one or more members selected from the group consisting of

 a a polycondensation resin obtainable by polycondensing an alcohol component containing an alcohol A and a carboxylic acid component containing at least one succinic acid derivative selected from alkyl 9 to 14 carbon atoms succinic acids and alkenyl 9 to 14 carbon atoms succinic acids and b a composite resin containing a polycondensation resin obtainable by polycondensing an alcohol component containing an alcohol A and a carboxylic acid component and a styrenic resin.

In addition in Embodiment I 3 the amorphous resin is one or more members selected from the group consisting of

 a a polycondensation resin obtainable by polycondensing a carboxylic acid component containing at least one succinic acid derivative selected from alkyl 9 to 14 carbon atoms succinic acids and alkenyl 9 to 14 carbon atoms succinic acids and an alcohol component and b a composite resin containing a polycondensation resin and a styrenic resin. Here as raw material monomers for a polycondensation resin usable in the composite resin a carboxylic acid component containing at least one succinic acid derivative selected from alkylsuccinic acids and alkenylsuccinic acids may be used.

In addition the amorphous resin may comprise two kinds a and b mentioned above. Here the succinic acid derivative may be an anhydride or a lower alkyl ester having 1 to 3 carbon atoms of an alkyl 9 to 14 carbon atoms succinic acid and an alkenyl 9 to 14 carbon atoms succinic acid.

In addition it is preferable that the alcohol component of the crystalline resin contains an linear alkanediol from the viewpoint of crystallinity of the resin.

It is preferable that a succinic acid derivative is used as a carboxylic acid component.

The raw material monomers for the styrenic resin and addition polymerization conditions therefor and the method for producing a composite resin are the same as those in Embodiment I 2.

The composite resin may be in the same manner as in Embodiment I 2 a mixture of a polycondensation resin and a styrenic resin and it is preferable that the composite resin is a hybrid resin obtainable from a dually reactive monomer in addition to the raw material monomers for a polycondensation resin and the raw material monomers for a styrenic resin from the viewpoint of improving low temperature fixing ability and triboelectric stability under high temperature high humidity conditions.

The amorphous resin has an acid value of preferably from 1 to 90 mgKOH g more preferably from 5 to 90 mgKOH g and even more preferably from 5 to 88 mgKOH g from the viewpoint of triboelectric chargeability and environmental stability of the toner.

In the resin binder of Embodiment I 3 the weight ratio of the crystalline resin to the amorphous resin i.e. crystalline resin amorphous resin is preferably from 10 90 to 40 60 and more preferably from 20 80 to 30 70.

By using the resin binder of the present invention as represented by Embodiments I 1 to I 3 the toner for electrophotography of the present invention excellent in both low temperature fixing ability and storage property which are counteractive properties is obtained.

In the toner a known resin binder other than the resin binder of the present invention for example a resin including a polyester a vinyl resin such as styrene acrylic resin an epoxy resin a polycarbonate or a polyurethane may be used together within the range that would not impair the effects of the present invention. The resin binder of the present invention is contained in an amount of preferably 30 by weight or more more preferably 50 by weight or more even more preferably 70 by weight or more even more preferably 80 by weight or more even more preferably 90 by weight or more and even more preferably essentially 100 by weight of the entire resin binder.

Here when a toner contains a charge control resin comprising a styrenic resin triboelectric chargeability of the toner is further increased. In general a styrenic resin is mainly used as a charge control resin. When used together with a polycondensation resin the styrenic resin has poor compatibility with a polycondensation resin such as a polyester so that triboelectric chargeability of the toner is likely to be worsened due to dispersion failure. This is presumably due to the fact that since the alcohol A has an alkyl group adjacent to secondary carbon atoms with a hydroxyl group bound thereto hydrophilicity near the ester groups is suppressed thereby resulting in high hydrophobicity so that compatibility between a polycondensation resin and with a charge control resin comprising a styrenic resin is improved thereby sufficiently exhibiting triboelectric chargeability of the charge control resin.

In the present invention a styrenic resin to be contained as a charge control resin is preferably a quaternary ammonium salt group containing styrenic resin from the viewpoint of exhibiting positive chargeability of the toner or a styrenic resin is preferably a sulfonic acid group containing styrenic resin from the viewpoint of exhibiting negative chargeability of the toner.

The quaternary ammonium salt group containing styrenic resin is more preferably a quaternary ammonium salt group containing styrene acrylic resin obtained by the polymerization of a monomer mixture containing a monomer represented by the formula IIIa 

wherein Ris a hydrogen atom or a methyl group and each of Rand Ris an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms

A quaternary compound forming agent includes alkyl halides such as methyl chloride and methyl iodide diethyl sulfate di n propyl sulfate and the like.

The monomer represented by the formula IIIa is preferably a styrene in which Ris a hydrogen atom and the monomer represented by the formula IIIb is a monomer in which Ris preferably a hydrogen atom and Ris an alkyl group having preferably from 1 to 6 carbon atoms and more preferably from 1 to 4 carbon atoms.

The monomer represented by the formula IIIc is preferably a monomer in which Ris a methyl group and Rand Rare a methyl group or an ethyl group and the monomer is more preferably dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate in which R Rand Rare a methyl group each being desirable.

In the quaternary ammonium salt group containing styrenic resin it is desirable that the monomer represented by the formula IIIa is contained in an amount of preferably from 60 to 97 by weight and more preferably from 70 to 90 by weight of the monomer mixture the monomer represented by the formula IIIb is contained in an amount of preferably from 1 to 33 by weight and more preferably from 5 to 20 by weight of the monomer mixture and the monomer represented by the formula IIIc or a quaternary compound thereof is contained in an amount of preferably from 2 to 35 by weight and more preferably from 5 to 20 by weight of the monomer mixture.

Specific examples of the quaternary ammonium salt group containing styrenic resin obtained from the monomers represented by the formulae IIIa to IIIc include butyl acrylate N N diethyl N methyl 2 methacryloyloxy ethyl ammonium styrene copolymers and the like.

It is preferable that the sulfonic acid group containing styrenic resin is a sulfonic acid group containing styrenic resin obtained by polymerizing a monomer mixture containing a monomer represented by the formula IIIa a monomer represented by the formula IIIb and a sulfonic acid group containing monomer as mentioned above.

The sulfonic acid group containing monomer includes meth allylsulfonic acid 2 meth acrylamide 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid and styrenesulfonic acid. Specific examples of the sulfonic acid group containing monomer include 2 ethylhexyl acrylate 2 acrylamide 2 methyl 1 propanesulfonic acid styrene copolymers and the like.

In the sulfonic acid group containing styrenic resin it is desirable that the monomer represented by the formula IIIc is contained in an amount of preferably from 60 to 97 by weight and more preferably from 70 to 90 by weight that the monomer represented by the formula IIIb is contained in an amount of preferably from 1 to 33 by weight and more preferably from 5 to 20 by weight and that the sulfonic acid group containing monomer is contained in an amount of preferably from 2 to 35 by weight and more preferably from 5 to 20 by weight of the monomer mixture.

In both of the quaternary ammonium salt group containing styrenic resin and the sulfonic acid group containing styrenic resin the polymerization of the monomer mixture can be carried out by for example heating a monomer mixture to 50 to 100 C. in an inert gas atmosphere in the presence of a polymerization initiator such as azobisdimethylvaleronitrile. Here the polymerization method may be any of solution polymerization suspension polymerization or bulk polymerization and preferably solution polymerization.

The styrenic resin is contained in an amount of preferably 70 by weight or more more preferably 80 by weight or more even more preferably 90 by weight or more and still even more preferably substantially 100 by weight of the charge control agent.

In addition since a polyester obtained from an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol has a high ester value the polyester has high hygroscopicity which leads to an insufficient initial rise in triboelectric charging. By including a resin obtained by polycondensation of an alcohol component containing an alcohol A and a carboxylic acid component and at least one charge control agent selected from a metal compound of salicylic acid compound and a metal compound of benzilic acid compound as a charge control agent an initial rise in triboelectric charging can be improved. The improvement is presumably due to the fact that an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having a specified structure mentioned above has an alkyl group at a terminal so that hydrophilicity near the ester group is suppressed thereby resulting in an increase in hydrophobicity and improvement in dispersibility of a charge control agent which is a metal compound of a salicylic acid compound and a benzilic acid compound.

Therefore it is preferable that the charge control agent contains at least one of a metal compound of a salicylic acid compound represented by the formula IV 

wherein each of R R and Ris independently a hydrogen atom a linear or branched alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms or alkenyl group having 2 to 10 carbon atoms A is chromium zinc calcium zirconium or aluminum p is an integer of 2 or more and q is an integer of 1 or more and

The metal compound of a salicylic acid compound represented by the formula IV may be either a metal salt or a metal complex.

Ltd. and the like.

Commercially available products of the metal compound of a benzilic acid compound represented by the formula V include LR 147 B boron manufactured by Japan Carlit LR 297 B aluminum manufactured by Japan Carlit and the like.

The metal compound of a salicylic acid compound represented by the formula IV or the metal compound of a benzilic acid compound represented by the formula V is contained in an amount or these compounds when used together are contained in a total amount of preferably from 0.01 to 10 parts by weight more preferably from 0.01 to 5 parts by weight even more preferably from 0.3 to 3 parts by weight still even more preferably from 0.5 to 3 parts by weight and still even more preferably from 1 to 2 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the resin binder from the viewpoint of an initial rise in triboelectric charging of the toner.

The releasing agent has a melting point of preferably from 60 to 160 C. and more preferably from 60 to 150 C. from the viewpoint of low temperature fixing ability and offset resistance of the toner.

The releasing agent is contained in an amount of preferably from 0.5 to 10 parts by weight more preferably from 1 to 8 parts by weight and even more preferably from 1.5 to 7 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the resin binder from the viewpoint of dispersibility of the releasing agent in the resin binder.

The toner may be a toner obtained by any of conventionally known methods such as a melt kneading method an emulsion phase inversion method and a polymerization method and a pulverized toner produced by the melt kneading method is preferable from the viewpoint of productivity and dispersibility of a colorant. In the case of a pulverized toner produced by a melt kneading method for example a toner can be produced by homogeneously mixing raw materials such as a resin binder a colorant a charge control agent and a releasing agent with a mixer such as a Henschel mixer thereafter melt kneading the mixture with a closed kneader a single screw or twin screw extruder an open roller type kneader or the like cooling pulverizing and classifying the product. On the other hand a toner produced by the polymerization method is preferable from the viewpoint of forming a toner having a small particle size. An external additive such as hydrophobic silica may be added to the surface of the toner.

The toner of the present invention has a volume median particle size D of preferably from 3 to 15 m and more preferably from 3 to 10 m. Here the volume median particle size D as used herein means a particle size at 50 counting from smaller particle sizes in a cumulative volume frequency calculated in volume percentage.

It is preferable that an external additive is added to the surface of the toner of the present invention. The external additive includes fine inorganic particles of silica alumina titanium oxide zirconia tin oxide zinc oxide and the like fine organic particles such as fine resin particles and the like. The surface of these fine particles may be subjected to a hydrophobic treatment.

In general a polycondensation resin obtained from an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol has insufficient transferability however in the present invention an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having a specified structure mentioned above and a specified external additive are used whereby transferability can be improved. One of the reasons is presumably due to the fact that the resin obtained from an alcohol A has a higher glass transition temperature as compared to resins having similar softening points. Specifically it is presumed that the embodiment of an external additive in the resin caused by a mechanical stress is reduced because of a high glass transition temperature owned by the resin thereby improving transferability. Further an external additive having an average particle size of 20 to 250 nm is used so that transferability is markedly improved. It is considered that this is because a suitable spacer effect is exhibited between the toner and the machine.

The external additive has an average particle size of preferably from 20 to 250 nm more preferably from 30 to 200 nm and even more preferably from 35 to 90 nm from the viewpoint of triboelectric chargeability flowability and transferability of the toner.

The external additive is preferably silica and more preferably one which contains silica having a small specific gravity from the viewpoint of preventing embedment.

The silica is preferably a hydrophobic silica that is hydrophobically treated from the viewpoint of transferability of the toner.

It is preferable that the method of subjecting silica to a hydrophobic treatment includes the step of modifying of a silanol group on the surface of the silica particles with a hydrophobic group such as an alkylsilyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms for example a methylsilyl group a hexylsilyl group or the like or coating the surface with a hydrophobic resin.

The hydrophobically treating agent for hydrophobically treating the surface of silica particles is exemplified by organochlorosilane organoalkoxysilane organodisilazane cyclic organopolysilazane linear organopolysiloxane and the like and specifically include hexamethyldisilazane HMDS dimethyldichlorosilane DMDS a silicone oil octyltriethoxysilane OTES methyltriethoxysilane and the like. Among them hexamethyldisilazane is preferred.

A method of substituting a silanol group on the surface of silica particles with a hydrophobic group such as an alkylsilyl group includes for example a method of reacting a water dispersed silica colloid with an alkali metal salt of an alkylsilanol see JP B Hei 7 33250 or the like a method of adding an organic solvent a cationic surfactant and an alkyltrialkoxysilane to a water dispersed silica colloid thereafter subjecting the mixture to an azeotropic dehydration and then further heating the residue under reflux see JP A Hei 6 73389 a method of treating a wet silica or dry silica with an alkyltrialkoxysilane an organohalogenated silicon compound or the like see JP A Hei 6 206720 JP A Hei 7 187647 or the like and the like.

In the silica that is hydrophobically treated at least a part of silanol groups on the surface of silica particles of which is substituted with a hydrophobic group it is desirable that the silanol groups on the surface of silica particles are substituted with hydrophobic groups in a ratio of preferably 5 by mol or more more preferably 10 by mol or more and even more preferably 20 by mol or more.

Here since the silanol group on the surface of silica particles is capable of ionically adsorbing an amino group or imino group the percentage of the silanol groups modified by the above mentioned hydrophobic groups can be known by for example measuring amounts of di n butylamine adsorbed to the silica before and after the modification reaction respectively. It is preferable that the treatment amount of the hydrophobically treating agent is from 1 to 7 mg mper surface area of the silica.

The external additive is contained in an amount of preferably from 0.05 to 5 parts by weight more preferably from 0.1 to 3 parts by weight and even more preferably from 0.3 to 3 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the toner particles before the treatment with the external additive.

Further the present invention provides the following Embodiments II 1 and II 2 as embodiments for toners obtainable from an alcohol A mentioned above of the present invention 

Embodiment II 1 a toner for electrophotography obtainable by a method including the step of forming raw materials containing a resin binder into fine particles in an aqueous medium wherein the resin binder containing a polycondensation resin obtainable by polycondensing an alcohol component containing an alcohol A and a carboxylic acid component and Embodiment II 2 a toner for electrophotography obtainable by a method including the step of forming raw materials containing a resin binder into fine particles in an aqueous medium wherein the resin binder contains a composite resin containing a polycondensation resin and a styrenic resin obtainable by polymerizing raw material monomers for a polycondensation resin and raw material monomers for a styrenic resin wherein the polycondensation resin is a resin obtainable by polycondensing an alcohol component containing an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having two or more secondary carbon atoms with a hydroxyl group bound thereto an alcohol A and a carboxylic acid component.

In a case where a toner is produced by forming raw materials containing a polycondensation resin obtained from an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol into fine particles in an aqueous medium hydrolysis is likely to take place thereby making it likely to lower storage property and hot offset resistance. However in the present invention since an alcohol A is used even when toner particles are formed in an aqueous medium the lowering in molecular weights is suppressed so that excellent storage property and hot offset resistance can be maintained. This is presumably due to the fact that an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having a specified structure mentioned above has an alkyl group at a terminal so that the ester groups are protected thereby improving hydrolytic resistance of the polycondensation resin and suppressing the lowering of molecular weights.

In Embodiment II 1 the resin binder contains a polycondensation resin obtainable by polycondensing an alcohol component containing an alcohol A and a carboxylic acid component.

The alcohol A is contained in an amount of preferably from 10 to 100 by mol more preferably from 12 to 80 by mol and even more preferably from 25 to 75 by mol of the alcohol component from the viewpoint of low temperature fixing ability and storage property of the toner.

In addition the amount of the alcohol A used upon the polycondensation of the alcohol component and the carboxylic acid component is preferably from 6 to 100 parts by weight more preferably from 10 to 90 parts by weight and even more preferably from 15 to 80 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of a total amount of the alcohol component other than the alcohol A and the carboxylic acid component which are the raw material monomers for the polycondensation resin from the viewpoint of low temperature fixing ability storage property and optical density under high temperature high humidity conditions of the toner.

It is preferable that the alcohol component contains an alcohol B mentioned above from the viewpoint of low temperature fixing ability of the toner in the same manner as in Embodiment I 1 for the resin binder mentioned above.

In addition the alcohol B is contained in an amount of preferably 10 mol or less preferably from 0.1 to 5 mol and more preferably from 0.3 to 3 mol per one mol of the alcohol A from the viewpoint of storage property and low temperature fixing ability of the toner.

The aromatic diol is contained in an amount of preferably 10 by mol or less and more preferably 5 by mol or less of the alcohol component from the viewpoint of low temperature fixing ability of the toner and it is preferable that substantially no aromatic diol is used. Here substantially no aromatic diol is used refers to an aromatic diol that is contained in an amount of 0 by mol or if any 1 by mol or less of the alcohol component.

It is preferable that the carboxylic acid component contains at least one succinic acid derivative selected from alkyl 9 to 14 carbon atoms succinic acids and alkenyl 9 to 14 carbon atoms succinic acids. An aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having a specified structure mentioned above has an alkyl group at a terminal and at the same time a succinic acid derivative having a long chain hydrocarbon group having high hydrophobicity is used together so that the ester groups are protected whereby hydrolytic resistance of the resulting polycondensation resin is even further improved and that the generation of background fogging under high temperature high humidity conditions is suppressed while maintaining low temperature fixing ability and storage property. The reason why the generation of background fogging is suppressed under high temperature high humidity conditions is presumably due to the fact that an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having a specified structure mentioned above has an alkyl group at a terminal so that hydrophilicity near the ester groups is suppressed and that at the same time a succinic acid derivative having a long chain hydrocarbon group having high hydrophobicity is used as a carboxylic acid component so that hygroscopicity is lowered.

The number of carbon atoms in the alkyl group or the alkenyl group in the alkylsuccinic acid and the alkenylsuccinic acid is from 9 to 14 and preferably from 10 to 12 from the viewpoint of increasing low temperature fixing ability storage property and suppression of background fogging under high temperature high humidity conditions of the toner.

Further it is preferable that the succinic acid derivative is one comprising two or more members selected from the group consisting of alkylsuccinic acids having a branched alkyl group of 9 to 14 carbon atoms and alkenylsuccinic acids having a branched alkenyl group of 9 to 14 carbon atoms from the viewpoint of increasing low temperature fixing ability and suppression of background fogging under high temperature high humidity conditions of the toner.

By using succinic acid derivatives having branched alkyl groups and or alkenyl groups with different numbers of carbon atoms in combination the resulting resins have a broad endothermic peak near a glass transition temperature in accordance with the differential scanning calorimetry DSC so that the resins have very wide fixing temperature regions as a resin binder for use in a toner.

The polycondensation resin includes polyesters polyester polyamides and the like. Among them polyesters are preferred from the viewpoint of durability and triboelectric chargeability.

Here the polyester may contain a polyester modified to an extent that the properties are substantially not impaired.

The toner for electrophotography of Embodiment II 1 is not particularly limited in its production method so long as the toner is obtained by a method including the step of forming raw materials containing a resin binder into fine particles in an aqueous medium and the method includes for example 

 A a method including the steps of previously forming primary particles containing a resin binder in an aqueous medium and aggregating unifying the primary particles 

 B a method including the steps of previously forming primary particles containing a resin binder in an aqueous medium and fusing the primary particles 

 C a method including the steps of dispersing raw materials containing a resin binder in an aqueous medium and forming the dispersion into fine particles and the like.

 1 introducing an aqueous medium to a mixed solution prepared by dissolving or dispersing raw materials containing a resin binder in an organic solvent and thereafter removing the organic solvent from the mixture to provide an aqueous dispersion of primary particles containing a resin binder and 2 aggregating or unifying the primary particles is preferred. Here another specific example of the method A is a method including the steps of 1 forming primary particles containing a resin binder in an aqueous medium in the presence of a nonionic surfactant and 2 aggregating or unifying the primary particles. A specific method of the method B includes a method including the steps of subjecting a radical polymerizable monomer solution in which a resin binder is dissolved to an emulsion polymerization to give fine resin particles and fusing the resulting fine resin particles in an aqueous medium see JP A 2001 42568 . A specific example of the method C includes a method including the steps of thermally melting raw materials containing a resin binder dispersing the raw materials in an aqueous medium without containing an organic solvent while maintaining a molten state of the resin binder and thereafter drying the dispersion see JP A 2001 235904 and the like.

The step 1 is a step of introducing an aqueous medium to a mixed solution prepared by dissolving or dispersing raw materials containing a resin binder in an organic solvent and thereafter removing the organic solvent from the mixture to provide an aqueous dispersion of primary particles containing a resin binder.

It is preferable that the organic solvent is used in an amount of from 100 to 1 000 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the resin binder. Water and further a neutralizing agent as occasion demands are mixed with the mixed solution while stirring and thereafter the organic solvent is removed from the resulting dispersion whereby an aqueous dispersion of primary particles of a self dispersible resin can be obtained.

The aqueous medium is used in an amount of preferably from 100 to 1 000 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the organic solvent. Here the aqueous medium usable in the process 1 and a step 1 described later may contain a solvent such as an organic solvent and contains water in an amount of preferably 50 by weight or more preferably 70 by weight or more more preferably from 90 by weight or more and even more preferably 99 by weight or more.

Upon stirring the mixture a generally employed mixing agitator such as an anchor blade can be used. The neutralizing agent includes an alkali metal of lithium hydroxide sodium hydroxide potassium hydroxide or the like organic bases such as ammonia trimethylamine ethylamine diethylamine triethylamine triethanolamine and tributylamine.

In addition the dispersion of primary particles containing a resin binder can be made into a dispersion without using an organic solvent as in the step 1 .

The step 1 is a step of forming primary particles containing a resin binder in an aqueous medium in the presence of a nonionic surfactant.

According to the process of the step 1 a resin binder can be formed into fine particles even when water is used alone without using substantially any organic solvents.

In the step 1 a resin binder containing a polycondensation resin and a nonionic surfactant are mixed whereby a dispersion can also be prepared without using an organic solvent. In this step a viscosity of the mixture is lowered so that a resin binder can be formed into fine particles. This is due to the fact that a nonionic surfactant is compatible to a resin binder and a viscosity of the mixture is lowered which results in an apparent lowering of a softening point of the resin. Utilizing this phenomenon an apparent softening point of a resin binder that is compatible with a nonionic surfactant can be lowered to a temperature of a boiling point of water or lower so that a dispersion prepared by dispersing a resin binder can be obtained by adding water dropwise under a normal pressure even with a resin binder having a melting point or softening point of 100 C. or more for the resin alone. In this method at least water and a nonionic surfactant would be needed so that the method can be applied to a resin insoluble to an organic solvent and that loads on the facilities for collecting an organic solvent and maintaining operating environments are unnecessary and a specialized apparatus that is to be needed when utilizing a mechanical means is also unnecessary thereby having an advantage that a resin dispersion can be produced economically.

The nonionic surfactant usable in the step 1 includes for example polyoxyethylene alkylaryl ethers or polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers such as polyoxyethylene nonylphenyl ether polyoxyethylene oleyl ether and polyoxyethylene lauryl ether polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate polyoxyethylene fatty esters such as polyethylene glycol monolaurate polyethylene glycol monostearate polyethylene glycol monooleate oxyethylene oxypropylene block copolymers and the like. In addition the nonionic surfactant may be used together with an anionic surfactant or a cationic surfactant.

It is preferable to select a nonionic surfactant which has excellent compatibility with a resin binder. In order to obtain a stable dispersion of a resin binder the nonionic surfactant has an HLB of preferably from 12 to 20 and it is more preferable to use two or more members of nonionic surfactants having different HLB depending on the members of the resin binders. For example in a case where a resin has a high hydrophilicity at least one member of a nonionic surfactant having an HLB of from 12 to 18 may be used. In a case of a resin having high hydrophobicity it is preferable that a nonionic surfactant having a low HLB for example one having an HLB of 7 to 10 or so and a nonionic surfactant having a high HLB for example one having an HLB of 14 to 20 are used together thereby adjusting a weighted average of HLB of both the nonionic surfactants to 12 to 20. In this case it is presumed that primarily a nonionic surfactant having an HLB of 7 to 10 or so can be made compatible with the resin and that a nonionic surfactant having a high HLB can serve to stabilize the dispersion of the resin in water.

In addition in a case where a colorant is used it is preferable that a nonionic surfactant is adsorbed to the colorant. By adjusting the HLB of the nonionic surfactant to the range mentioned above the nonionic surfactant is likely to adsorb to the surface of the colorant whereby the nonionic surfactant can be stably present in the resin binder.

When a resin binder is formed into fine particles in water under a normal pressure the nonionic surfactant has a cloud point of preferably from 70 to 105 C. and more preferably from 80 to 105 C.

The nonionic surfactant is used in an amount of preferably 5 parts by weight or more based on 100 parts by weight of the resin binder from the viewpoint of lowering a melting point of the resin binder and the nonionic surfactant is used in an amount of preferably 80 parts by weight or less from the viewpoint of controlling the nonionic surfactant remaining in the toner. Therefore the nonionic surfactant is used in an amount of preferably from 5 to 80 parts by weight more preferably from 10 to 70 parts by weight and even more preferably from 20 to 60 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the resin binder from the viewpoint of satisfying both of these.

In the step 1 upon the formation of primary particles containing a resin binder in an aqueous medium in the presence of a nonionic surfactant it is desirable that the temperature inside the system is kept within a temperature calculated from a cloud point of the nonionic surfactant plus or minus 10 C. preferably plus or minus 8 C. more preferably plus or minus 5 C. from the viewpoint of dispersibility of the nonionic surfactant and prevention of the lowering of dispersion efficiency.

In the step 1 for example it is preferable that an aqueous medium preferably deionized water or distilled water is added dropwise to a system in a state where a mixture of a resin binder and a nonionic surfactant is stirred and homogeneously mixed. In a case where a colorant is used it is preferable that a resin binder containing a colorant being made compatible with a nonionic surfactant does not separate from water.

The aqueous medium in the step 1 is used in an amount of preferably from 100 to 3 000 parts by weight more preferably from 400 to 3 000 parts by weight and even more preferably from 800 to 3 000 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the resin binder from the viewpoint of obtaining homogeneous aggregated particles in the subsequent steps.

The particle size of the primary particles containing a resin binder containing a polycondensation resin can be controlled by an amount of the nonionic surfactant an extent of stirring a rate of adding water or the like. In the step 1 the rate of adding an aqueous medium to a mixture containing at least a resin binder and a nonionic surfactant is preferably from 0.1 to 50 g min more preferably from 0.5 to 40 g min and even more preferably from 1 to 30 g min per 100 g of the mixture from the viewpoint of obtaining homogenous primary particles.

In a case where a resin binder has an acidic group such as a carboxyl group or a sulfonate group water may be added after a part or all of the resin binder is neutralized or while neutralizing. In a case where a resin binder having an acidic group is used in addition to the factors of the nonionic surfactant self emulsifiability would be a controlling factor for the particle size of the primary particles.

A dispersant can be used for the purposes of lowering a melt viscosity and a melting point of the resin binder and improving dispersibility of the formed primary particles. The dispersant includes for example water soluble polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol methyl cellulose ethyl cellulose hydroxyethyl cellulose carboxymethyl cellulose sodium polyacrylate and sodium polymethacrylate anionic surfactants such as sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate sodium octadecyl sulfate sodium oleate sodium laurate and potassium stearate cationic surfactants such as laurylamine acetate stearylamine acetate and lauryl trimethylammonium chloride amphoteric surfactants such as lauryl dimethylamine oxide and inorganic salts such as tricalcium phosphate aluminum hydroxide calcium sulfate calcium carbonate and barium carbonate. The dispersant is used in an amount of preferably 20 parts by weight or less more preferably 15 parts by weight or less and even more preferably 10 parts by weight or less based on 100 parts by weight of the resin binder from the viewpoint of emulsion stability and detergency.

The solid content of the dispersion of the primary particles containing a resin binder obtained in the step 1 or the step 1 hereinafter also simply referred to as primary particles is preferably from 7 to 50 by weight and more preferably from 7 to 40 by weight from the viewpoint of stability of the dispersion and handling property of the dispersion in the aggregating step. The solid content includes non volatile components such as a resin and a nonionic surfactant.

The primary particles have an average particle size of preferably from 0.05 to 3 m more preferably from 0.05 to 1 m and even more preferably from 0.05 to 0.8 m from the viewpoint of homogeneously aggregating the primary particles in the subsequent steps. In the present invention the average particle size of the primary particles refers to a volume median particle size D which can be measured with a laser diffraction particle size analyzer or the like.

Subsequently the step of aggregating and unifying the primary particles obtained in the step 1 or the step 1 step 2 will be explained.

In the step 2 the solid content of the system in the aggregating step of aggregating the primary particles obtained in the step 1 or the step 1 can be adjusted by adding water to a dispersion of a resin binder and the solid content is preferably from 5 to 50 by weight more preferably from 5 to 30 by weight and even more preferably from 5 to 20 by weight in order to cause homogeneous aggregation.

The pH inside the system in the aggregating step is preferably from 2 to 10 more preferably from 2 to 9 and even more preferably from 3 to 8 from the viewpoint of satisfying both dispersion stability of a mixed solution and aggregating property of the fine particles made of a resin binder or the like.

It is preferable that the temperature inside the system in the aggregating step is a temperature equal to or higher than a temperature calculated from a softening point of a resin binder minus 70 C. or more and equal to or lower than a softening point from the same viewpoint.

In addition an additive such as a colorant or a charge control agent may be previously mixed with a resin binder upon the preparation of primary particles or each additive may be separately dispersed in a dispersion medium such as water to prepare a dispersion and the dispersion is mixed with primary particle s and subjected to the aggregating step. In a case where an additive is previously mixed with a resin binder upon the preparation of primary particles it is preferable that the resin binder and the additive are previously melt kneaded. In the melt kneading it is preferable to use an open roller type twin screw kneader. The open roller twin screw kneader is a kneader containing two rollers arranged in parallel closely to each other wherein a heating function or a cooling function can be provided by passing a heating medium through each roller. Therefore the open roller type twin screw kneader contains a melt kneading part that is open and also is equipped with a heat roller and a cooling roller so that the open roller type twin screw kneader can easily dissipate the kneading heat generated during the melt kneading which is different from twin screw extruders conventionally used.

In the aggregating step in order to effectively carry out the aggregation an aggregating agent can be added. As the aggregating agent a cationic surfactant in the form of a quaternary salt polyethyleneimine or the like may be used as an organic aggregating agent and an inorganic metal salt a divalent or higher polyvalent metal complex or the like may be used as an inorganic aggregating agent. The inorganic metal salt includes for example metal salts such as sodium sulfate sodium chloride calcium chloride calcium nitrate barium chloride magnesium chloride zinc chloride aluminum chloride and aluminum sulfate and inorganic metal salt polymers such as poly aluminum chloride poly aluminum hydroxide and poly calcium sulfide .

The amount of the aggregating agent used is preferably 30 parts by weight or less more preferably 20 parts by weight or less and even more preferably 10 parts by weight or less based on 100 parts by weight of the resin binder from the viewpoint of the environmental resistance of the toner.

Subsequently the aggregated particles containing at least a resin binder obtained in the above mentioned aggregating step are heated to unify unifying step .

The temperature inside the system in the unifying step is preferably equal to or higher than a temperature calculated from the softening point of the resin binder minus 50 C. and equal to or lower than a temperature calculated from the softening point of the resin binder plus 10 C. more preferably equal to or higher than the softening point of the resin binder minus 45 C. and equal to or lower than a temperature calculated from the softening point plus 10 C. and even more preferably equal to or higher than the softening point of the resin binder minus 40 C. and equal to or lower than a temperature calculated from the softening point of the resin binder plus 10 C. from the viewpoint of controlling particle sizes particle size distribution and shapes of the intended toner and fusibility of the aggregate particles. In addition it is preferable that the stirring rate is a rate at which the aggregate particles are not precipitated. In the present invention in a case where two or more kinds of resins are used as a resin binder a softening point of a mixed resin is regarded as a softening point of the resin binder.

The unified particles obtained in the step 2 are subjected through the steps such as liquid solid separation step such as filtration washing step and drying step whereby a toner can be obtained.

In the washing step it is preferable that an acid is used for removing metal ions on the toner surface in order to secure satisfactory triboelectric charging properties and reliability as a toner. Also it is preferable that the added nonionic surfactant is completely removed by washing and it is preferable that the washing is carried out with an aqueous solution at a temperature equal to or lower than the cloud point of the nonionic surfactant. The washing is carried out preferably plural times.

In addition in the drying step any methods such as vibration type fluidizing drying method spray drying method freeze drying method or flash jet method can be employed.

The toner has a volume median particle size D preferably from 1 to 10 m more preferably from 2 to 8 m and even more preferably from 3 to 7 m. Here the volume median particle size D as used herein means a particle size at 50 counting from smaller particle sizes in a cumulative volume frequency calculated in volume percentage.

An external additive may be added to the surface of the toner. The external additive includes fine inorganic particles of silica alumina titanium oxide zirconia tin oxide zinc oxide and the like fine organic particles such as fine resin particles and the like. The surface of these fine particles may be subjected to a hydrophobic treatment. It is preferable that the external additive is added in an amount of from 0.05 to 5 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of toner particles before subjection to a treatment with the external additive.

In Embodiment II 2 the resin binder contains a composite resin containing a polycondensation resin and a styrenic resin obtainable from the polymerization of raw material monomers for a polycondensation resin and raw material monomers for a styrenic resin.

An alcohol component containing an alcohol A and a carboxylic acid component are used as the raw material monomers for a polycondensation resin and raw material monomers for a styrenic resin are used as the above mentioned raw material monomers for the styrenic resin whereby hydrolytic resistance of the polycondensation resin is even further improved. This is presumably due to the fact that an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol having a specified structure has an alkyl group at a terminal and at the same time the styrenic resin has a high hydrophobicity so the ester groups are protected thereby improving hydrolytic resistance of the polycondensation resin and suppressing the lowering of molecular weight.

In addition in a chemical toner for which an additive cannot be dispersed by applying a shearing force as in a kneading pulverization method durability is likely to be worsened due to dispersion failure of a releasing agent or the like but on the other hand durability is also improved. The reason why durability is improved is presumably due to the fact that alkyl groups are adjoined to the secondary carbon atoms with a hydroxyl group bound thereto so that hydrophilicity near the ester group is suppressed and that at the same time a hydrophobic styrenic resin is contained so that dispersibility of an additive such as a releasing agent is improved.

The alcohol A is contained in an amount of preferably from 10 to 100 by mol more preferably from 12 to 80 by mol and even more preferably from 25 to 75 by mol of the alcohol component of the polycondensation resin from the viewpoint of low temperature fixing ability and storage property of the toner.

The composite resin may be a mixture of a polycondensation resin and a styrenic resin preferably a resin obtainable by the polymerization raw materials for a polycondensation resin and raw materials for a styrenic resin and it is more preferable that the composite resin is a hybrid resin obtainable from a dually reactive monomer in addition to the raw material monomers for a polycondensation resin and the raw material monomers for a styrenic resin in the same manner as in Embodiment I 1 from the viewpoint of improving storage property hot offset resistance and durability of the toner.

The composite resin may be a resin obtainable by polymerizing raw material monomers in the presence of a wax.

The weight ratio of the polycondensation resin to the styrenic resin in other words a weight ratio of the raw material monomers for a polycondensation resin to the raw material monomers for a styrenic resin i.e. raw material monomers for a polycondensation resin raw material monomers for a styrenic resin is preferably from 55 45 to 95 5 more preferably from 60 40 to 95 5 and even more preferably from 70 30 to 90 10 because it is preferable that a continuous phase comprises the polycondensation resin and a dispersed phase comprises the styrenic resin.

The composite resin has a softening point of preferably from 90 to 160 C. more preferably from 95 to 155 C. and even more preferably from 115 to 150 C. from the viewpoint of low temperature fixing ability storage property and durability of the toner. The composite resin has a glass transition temperature of preferably from 45 to 85 C. more preferably from 50 to 80 C. and even more preferably from 58 to 75 C. from the viewpoint of low temperature fixing ability storage property and durability of the toner. The composite resin has an acid value of preferably from 1 to 90 mg KOH g more preferably from 5 to 90 mg KOH g and even more preferably from 5 to 88 mg KOH g from the viewpoint of triboelectric chargeability and environmental stability of the toner.

The toner for electrophotography of Embodiment II 2 is not particularly limited in its production method so long as the toner is obtained by a method including the step of forming raw materials containing a resin binder in an aqueous medium into fine particles and a specific production method thereof is the same as those in Embodiment II 1.

The toner has a volume median particle size D preferably from 1 to 10 m more preferably from 2 to 8 m and even more preferably from 3 to 7 m. Here the volume median particle size D as used herein means a particle size at 50 counting from smaller particle sizes in a cumulative volume frequency calculated in volume percentage.

An external additive may be added to the surface of the toner.
