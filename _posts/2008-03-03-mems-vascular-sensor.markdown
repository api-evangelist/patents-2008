This invention was made with government support under Grant No. HL068689 01 awarded by the National Institutes for Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.

Coronary artery disease may be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the industrialized nations. Vascular parameters in particular shear stress acting on blood vessel walls may play an important role in regulating the development of atherosclerosis because shear stress may intimately modulate the biological activities of vascular endothelial cells ECs which line the inner lumen of blood vessels. Shear stress has been directly correlated with the distribution of focal atherosclerotic lesions in the arterial wall. Also there is growing evidence that disturbed blood flow or decreased wall shear stress associated with flow separation favors the formation of arteriosclerosis.

Measurement of shear stress is thus important for the pathogenesis of coronary artery diseases. In addition shear stress measurement may be important in order to study the durability of prosthetic valves as well as to monitor platelet aggregation in cardiopulmonary bypass machines and in artificial heart and left ventricular assist devices LVADs . Diagnostically luminal shear stress measurement may predict the development of atherosclerotic plaque in patients at risk for acute coronary syndrome. Further luminal shear stress measurement may provide clinical information that can predict recurrent plaque formations in patients who have undergone intravascular stent deployment or bypass graft.

Measurement of wall shear stress in particular near wall shear stress remains an engineering challenge however. The wall shear stress as obtained from a laser Doppler velocimeter or a particle image velocimeter may have an increased noise level due to the reflection from the wall. Another challenge is the application of in situ devices such as heated wires which have to be employed close to the vessel wall to measure shear stress. Typically the vessel wall may act as a potential heat sink diverting the direction of convective heat transfer from the hot wires so that heat is conveyed to the vessel wall instead of to the working fluid or blood. This causes a decrease in the sensitivity of the measurements.

Measuring temporal and spatial variations in shear stress both of which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is especially challenging. Micromachined MEMS micro electro mechanical sensors may provide possibilities for in situ shear stress measurement and for overcoming difficulties in measuring temporal and spatial variations in shear stress. Operating the MEMS sensors in a liquid environment as may be necessary in many biomedical applications may affect the sensitivity of the MEMS sensors. For example MEMS sensors that are driven by front side wire bonding may require insulation using sealants which however may undergo expansion after prolonged exposure to the fluidic environment. Also in MEMS sensors for which wire bonding is established on the front side the elevation of microcircuitry on the same side of sensing element may disturb the local flow milieu thus negatively affecting the precision of the shear stress measurement.

For these reasons there is a need for improved methods and systems for precisely measuring real time shear stress in microfluidic channels and microcirculation as well as in large scale arterial circulation.

A micromachined sensor for measuring fluid shear stress may include a substrate having a front side surface and a backside surface opposite the front side surface. The sensor may include a diaphragm overlying a cavity etched within the substrate. The sensor may include a heat sensing element disposed on the front side surface of the substrate and on top of the cavity and the diaphragm. The heat sensing element may be electrically couplable to electrode leads formed on the backside surface of the substrate. The sensor may include an electronic system connected to the backside surface and configured to measure a change in heat convection from the sensing element to surrounding fluid when the sensing element is heated by applying an electric current thereto and further configured to derive from the change in heat convection a shear stress of the surrounding fluid that flows past the sensing element.

A method of fabricating a micromachined shear stress sensor may include depositing a layer of silicon nitride on a substrate having a front side surface and a backside surface. The method may include etching the substrate to form a cavity having an overlying diaphragm and performing reactive ion etching on the diaphragm to create a plurality of access slits on the diaphragm.

The method may include conformally depositing a layer of polysilicon on the substrate then doping the polysilicon layer with phosphorus. The method may include sputtering a layer of aluminum onto the backside surface of the substrate and patterning the aluminum layer to form a plurality of electrode leads. The method may further include patterning the polysilicon layer on the front side surface of the substrate to form a strip heat sensing element. The method may further include connecting a plurality of wire bonds between the sensing element on the front side surface and the electrode leads on the backside surface by passing the wire bonds through the access slits on the diaphragm.

A method of measuring shear stress on a blood vessel wall may include introducing a backside wire bonded MEMS sensor into a desired location in a flow field of blood flowing though a blood vessel. The MEMS sensor may include a heat sensing element disposed on a front side surface of a substrate the heat sensing element interfacing the flowing blood and coupled to electrode leads formed on a backside surface of the substrate opposite the front side surface. The method may include applying an electrical current to the sensing element from a driving circuit coupled to the backside surface. The method may further include measuring a change in heat convection from the sensing element to surrounding blood fluid by measuring a voltage that needs to be applied across the heat sensing element in order to maintain the sensing element at a substantially constant temperature. The method may further include deriving the shear stress at the desired location from the measured change in heat convection.

An apparatus for measuring shear stress from arterial circulation may include a flexible catheter and a MEMS sensor attached to the distal end of the flexible catheter. The MEMS sensor may include a heat sensing element disposed on a front side surface of a substrate and interfacing a flow of blood through a vessel. The heat sensing element may be thermally insulated from the substrate through a cavity etched in the substrate. The heat sensing element may be electrically coupled to a backside surface of the substrate by bond wires.

A driving circuit may be electrically coupled to the backside surface of the substrate and configured to drive the MEMS sensor. The driving circuit may be configured to apply an electric current through the sensing element to resistively heat the sensing element. The driving circuit may be further configured to apply a voltage across the sensing element necessary to maintain the sensing element at a substantially constant temperature. The apparatus may further include a processing system configured to determine from the voltage applied by the driving circuit a change in heat convection from the sensing element to blood surrounding the sensing element and deriving from the change in heat convection a shear stress of blood flowing through the vessel past the sensing element.

A micromachined sensor for measuring one or more vascular parameters may include a substrate having a front side surface and a backside surface opposite the front side surface. The sensor may include a diaphragm overlying a cavity etched within the substrate. The sensor may include a heat sensing element disposed on the front side surface of the substrate and on top of the cavity and the diaphragm. The heat sensing element may be electrically couplable to electrode leads formed on the backside surface of the substrate. The sensor may include an electronic system connected to the backside surface and configured to measure a change in heat convection from the sensing element to surrounding fluid when the sensing element is heated by applying an electric current thereto and further configured to derive the vascular parameters from the measured change in heat convection.

A system and method are disclosed for measuring fluid shear stress with a MEMS shear stress sensor and for fabricating the MEMS sensor. The MEMS sensor may be backside wire bonded and may operate based on basic heat transfer principles. The backside wire bonding may insulate the micro circuitry in the MEMS sensor from the fluid. The MEMS sensor may include an etched cavity that may improve the sensitivity of the sensor by minimizing heat conductance loss from the heat sensing component of the sensor.

After an electric current is applied through the sensing element a change in heat convection from the resistively heated sensing element to the flowing fluid is measured from which a value for shear stress is inferred using basic heat transfer equations described in further detail below. The electronic system may thus be configured to measure a change in heat convection from the sensing element to the surrounding fluid when the sensing element is heated by applying an electric current thereto. The electronic system may thus be further configured to derive from the measured change in heat convection a shear stress of the fluid that interfaces and flows past the sensing element .

Changes in heat convection may be measured by determining the changes in voltage across the sensing element. The changes in voltage may be calibrated to the shear stress as described further below and illustrated in . Further these changes in voltage may be calibrated to measurements of vascular parameters other than shear stress including but not limited to pressure flow rate and temperature.

The heat sensing element may be disposed on the front side surface of the substrate and on top of the cavity and the diaphragm . A number of electrode leads may be formed on the backside surface of the substrate . The heat sensing element on the front side surface may be configured to be electrically coupled by bond wires to the electrode leads on the backside surface of the substrate which in turn is coupled to the electronic micro circuitry in the electronic system . In this way the sensor is backside wire bonded and only the heat sensing element but not the micro circuitry is exposed to the flowing blood fluid.

In one embodiment the sensing element may be a polysilicon strip uniformly doped with phosphorus and may have a length of about 80 m a width of about 2 m and a depth of about 0.5 m. The resistance of the sensing element may be adjusted by changing the doping concentration. In one embodiment the doping may be performed at a concentration of about 10cm which may result in a sheet resistance of 32 cm and a resistance value of 2.5 k at room temperature. In general the resistance of the sensing element made of polysilicon doped with phosphorus may range from about 1 k to 5 k which is much higher than the resistances typically found in conventional metal sensors about 5 to about 50 . This may greatly increase the sensitivity of MEMS sensors.

As seen in the sensing element may be disposed on the diaphragm above the cavity . The cavity may be a formed by anisotropic wet etching by KOH. The cavity provides effective thermal isolation between the sensing element and the substrate by minimizing the heat conduction from the diaphragm to the substrate and thus optimizing unidirectional convective heat transfer from the sensing element to the flowing fluid. The KOH etched cavity eliminates the need for additional masks and fabrication steps which were needed in order to obtain thermal isolation in front side wire bonded MEMS sensors in which the sensing elements are deposited on a surface micromachining created vacuum cavity on the front side.

The diaphragm resulting from the KOH etched cavity may improve the sensitivity of the sensor by directing the convective heat transfer from the phosphorous doped sensing element to the biological fluids and minimizing heat transfer to the silicon substrate by conductive heat loss. The diaphragm may be formed by a layer of silicon nitride deposited on the substrate for example using low pressure chemical vapor deposition LPCVD then etching the cavity . This may be followed by thermal oxidation which may create a layer of silicon oxide as described in further detail in conjunction with .

The diaphragm may include a pair of access slits which may be formed by reactive ion etching RIE and which may permit passage of bond wires therethrough so that the heat sensing element can be connected to the electrode leads on the backside surface of the substrate through the bond wires. The diaphragm thus enables backside wire bonding for the MEMS sensor by establishing electric contact between the aluminum metallization on the backside surface and the sensing element through the RIE etched slits . The electrode leads on the backside surface which allow bond wires to connect to the phosphorous doped polysilicon sensing element on the front side surface may be formed by thermal evaporation of a layer of aluminum .

The MEMS sensor may be placed at a desired location along the blood vessel for example near an arterial bifurcation. For this purpose a flexible catheter not shown may be used for example and the MEMS sensor may be attached to a distal end of the flexible catheter. Heart disease i.e. atherosclerosis preferentially develops at arterial branching points or bifurcations. illustrates an exemplary 3 D model of an arterial bifurcation showing the relation between the inlet branch and two symmetric outlet branches and . illustrates a backside wire bonded MEMS sensor mounted on an inlet branch of an arterial bifurcation. As illustrated in backside wire bonding may shield the sensor electronic circuitry connected to the electrode leads on the backside surface of the sensor from being exposed to biological fluids. This may allow for precise shear stress measurement without causing flow disturbance from the wire bonding.

To establish electrical connectivity using backside wire bonding reactive ion etching may be performed on the silicon nitride diaphragm as illustrated in to generate a pair of access slits. The reactive ion etching may be performed at about 100 m Torr and at about 150 W. In the illustrated embodiment the spacing of the slits may be about 6 micrometers in width to allow for conformal deposition of polysilicon. As illustrated in a layer of polysilicon which may have a thickness of about 3 m is conformally deposited by LPCVD then the polysilicon layer is doped with phosphorus. As explained earlier the doping concentration may be adjusted to adjust the resistance. In the illustrated embodiment the doping may be performed at a concentration of about 10 cmat 40 KeV. The doping may be followed by annealing at about 1000 C.

The doping and annealing may be followed by aluminum metallization. sputtering of a thin film of aluminum. In the polysilicon strip on the backside of length about 40 m may be etched and patterned at the center using RIE. A thin film of aluminum may then be sputtered as shown in . The aluminum layer may have a thickness of about 0.4 m. On the backside aluminum metallization may be patterned at three locations as shown in . On the front side the poly silicon layer may be patterned to form the sensing element at 2 m in width and 80 m in length as shown in .

The MEMS sensor operates based on heat transfer principles. The wall shear stress is linearly proportionally to the stream wise pressure gradient. From Newtonian fluid equations the steady shear stress is given as follows 2 8 1 where denotes the shear stress rdenotes the radius of channel denotes the dynamic viscosity of fluid and Q denotes the volume flow rate cross section area of the channel times velocity . In a fully developed laminar flow the boundary layer velocity profile determines the rate of heat transfer from a heated resistive element to the surrounding fluid field. The input ohmic power P delivered to the sensing element when a voltage V is applied across the sensing element is defined as

In equation 2 above Ais an empirical coefficient determined by a combination of effective area of the sensing element the stream wise length of the sensing element heat capacity thermal conductivity and viscosity of fluid. Bdenotes the conductance heat loss to the surface and R is the resistance of the sensing element at room temperature.

where Ris the resistance at room temperature T and alpha is the temperature coefficient of resistance TCR .

where R denotes the resistance at experimental temperature and Ris the resistance at ambient temperature. The higher the resistance over heat ratio Dis the higher the sensitivity will be. In one embodiment the resistance over heat ratio may be set at about 0.06.

From equations 1 and 2 above it can be seen that the desired shear stress can be obtained by measuring the change in heat convection related to the velocity of the flowing fluid which in turn is related to the volume flow rate Q in equation 1 . As explained earlier the change in heat convection may be determined by measuring a change in voltage across the sensing element.

The electronic system may thus be configured in one embodiment to measure the change in heat convection from the sensing element to the surrounding fluid by determining a change in voltage across the sensing element that is required in order to maintain the sensing element at a substantially constant temperature. The electronic system may be configured to determine the shear stress from the measured change in heat convection by finding a value of the shear stress that satisfies equation 2 above.

The operation and fabrication MEMS sensor has been described above in conjunction with the measurement of fluid shear stress. It should be noted that the same techniques principles and equations described above can be used to measure vascular parameters other than shear stress including but not limited to pressure flow rate and temperature.

Calibration may be conducted for the MEMS sensor to establish a linear relation between Vand . By plotting voltage vs. flow rates as shown in a relation can be obtained between voltage and shear stress using equation 2 . illustrates a linear relationship between the average output voltage signals and the steady flow rates ranging from 1.0 to 5.0 ml min. Individual steady flow rates Qmay be generated and the voltage signals Vn may be obtained as the average output signals from the MEMS sensor corresponding to these individual flow rates at 26 0.15 C. As shown in the voltage decreases as the temperature rises reflecting the negative TCR of the phosphorous doped polysilicon.

In sum improved methods and systems have been designed to obtain real time vascular parameters in geometrically complicated arterial circulation. These parameters include but are not limited to shear stress pressure flow rate and temperature. A number of design features are implemented with MEMS sensors for biomedical applications. Backside wire bonding is implemented and insulation of external wire contacts are made on the backside of the device. This approach allows for precise wall shear stress measurement without flow disturbance as a result of wire bonding. The micro circuitry is established on the backside of the sensor through the electric connection between the aluminum metallization on the backside and the phosphorous doped polysilicon on the front side.

In addition a KOH etched cavity minimizes heat transfer from the sensing element to the substrate thereby optimizing heat transfer to the fluid and simplifying sensor fabrication steps. Thermal isolation also optimizes the sensitivity of the MEMS sensors. Further the polysilicon sensing element is uniformly doped with phosphorous to generate a sheet resistance at 32 cmand a resistance value of 2.5 k at room temperature. For comparison MEMS sensor resistances typically lie in the range of 1 to 5 k and traditional metal sensors typically have resistances ranging from 5 50 . This high resistance results in an increase in the sensor s sensitivity.
