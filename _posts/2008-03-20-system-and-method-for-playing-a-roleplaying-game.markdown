Prior to a game session a game player may need to pay for playing. For example a game player may pay using money or loyalty points. In particular a game player may pay using money by debit card credit card check cash or from an account credit either with the gaming operator or an affiliated organization. Alternatively a game player may pay using loyalty points from an account held either by the gaming operator or by an affiliated organization. Loyalty points may be obtained from any type of organization but are generally associated with loyalty programs such as frequent flier programs for airlines frequent stay programs for hotels or frequent visitor programs for casinos. The game player may pay in person e.g. by using a cashier or through other remote methods including a telephone a cell phone a handheld device e.g. a PDA a kiosk a computer Internet coupled through the Internet or other network a set top box mail or other method. Payment may be in any form that is legal in the particular jurisdiction. Most preferably the game player pays to play at a casino through a lottery agent or over the Internet.

In one embodiment of the invention players may subscribe to play multiple preferably consecutive game sessions. That is a player may pay at one time to play many game sessions. According to one embodiment such a player may subscribe to multiple games using any payment method described above. These subscribed games may be automatically played e.g. by a computer system . In another embodiment a player may also choose to have his or her subscription automatically renewed.

According to one embodiment of the invention players may also enter to play this or any other wagering game of chance using an alternative method of entry AMOE . AMOE is a required available method of entry that does not require a purchase to enter a sweepstake sweepstakes are usually used as a promotional or marketing tool. An individual entering a sweepstakes by AMOE is required by law to have the same odds of winning each of the available prizes.

A common AMOE method includes sending by an individual interested in entering the sweepstakes a post card with his or her name address or other contact information to a sweepstakes offerer. Another AMOE method includes signing on by the individual to an Internet website and submitting the required information for free. Numerous other methods may be used for performing AMOE. Most sweepstakes limit the number of times one individual or family may enter a sweepstakes by AMOE.

According to one embodiment of the invention it is realized that an AMOE alternative method of entry may be used to enter a game of skill or chance. More particularly it is possible to develop implement and run wagering games of skill or chance including the inventive games described herein with an AMOE method of entry. AMOE methods are conventionally used to enter a player in a sweepstakes which is not considered wagering or gambling. Thus according to one embodiment of the invention an individual may enter the wagering game of skill or chance by AMOE using for example the post card or the online method outlined above. The wagering game of skill or chance player entering by AMOE may also have the same odds to win the payout associated with the game in which they are entered. The wagering game of skill or chance player entering by AMOE may also be limited to a small number of games within a given period of time for example a player entering by AMOE may be limited to entering one game in one year or two games in one month. Other numbers of games and given periods may be any number and the invention is not limited to any particular implementation.

According to one embodiment the game that the game player entering by AMOE is entered into may be determined by the game player on the AMOE entry form. For example the post card AMOE may be required to state the date and the time of the game that the game player wants to enter. Alternatively the game entered may be the next starting game after the AMOE is received and logged. As another alternative AMOE entries may be assigned to a specific game s each hour day week or other time interval.

A gaming operator may collect revenue for operating the game by one or more methods. In one example the gaming operator collects and retains a portion of an entry fee from each player the portion being an amount over that which is retained by the gaming operator to pay out for prizes. The entry fee may be for example a fee paid for a single game a fee for entry in a series of games e.g. a subscription or an entry fee associated with a tournament.

Further the gaming operator may generate revenue by accepting bets waged by a player or other person e.g. a person viewing the game on an outcome of the game. For instance a player may bet on whether another player will have a winning combination in a game session a certain number of winning combinations in a certain number of game sessions or another outcome. The gaming operator may calculate odds of a particular outcome and determine a payment on that basis the pay out may also not be directly related to the odds for a particular outcome.

System includes an interface that interacts with a user e.g. a player to play the keno type game place wagers or communicate information relating to a game session. Interface may be for example an interface of a computer system e.g. an interface presented by a browser program operating in a memory of a computer system or any type of interface. System may also include a game processor that performs functions relating to conducting the game and any other functions related to the game. Game processor may be for example one or more computer processes executing in a memory of system . Processor may receive and process bets placed by users through interface conduct game sessions and rules of the game and determine wins and payouts to players.

Information relating to game sessions may be stored in one or more storage entities e.g. a device such as a disk associated with system . Storage may for example store information directly relating to game play e.g. current card setup predetermined winning combination current state of game play or other information relating to game play or payment. System may include a payment component that receives payment information from a user through interface to pay for example subscription fees to play one or more game sessions. Payments may include for example wagers placed by players or any additional bets e.g. tournament entry fees paid by a player in association with playing a game. Payment component may communicate with one or more payment systems for the purpose of obtaining payment for playing the game.

According to one embodiment a game has predetermined prize levels associated with it. The prize levels may also have adjustments for a player s subscription. For instance the prize levels may increase if the player has a multiple game subscription of high payment per game. The prize levels may also be adjusted for numerous other criterion including frequent player credits. Of course all prize level adjustments must meet any legal requirements for the gaming jurisdiction in which the game is played.

The prize levels for each game may also be supplemented by a jackpot that transfers from game session to game session. These types of jackpots are commonly referred to as rolling or progressive jackpots. A rolling jackpot may be for example the same amount that transfers from game to game until the jackpot is paid out. A progressive jackpot is a rolling jackpot that increases as more games game cards or other criterion are played.

The final prize level may also be affected by bonus play which is well known in the gaming industry. Bonus play works to increase some payouts by offering the chance to multiply a payout.

One or more games may proceed concurrently. Parameters of concurrent games may be the same similar or different. Additionally games may run continually i.e. one after another. When one game ends another game may begin immediately or in a short period of time. Game sessions may follow a precise time schedule so that players know when game will begin. If game play in a game requires four and a half 4.5 minutes to complete then the next game may start immediately or in thirty seconds to keep to a schedule of games every five minutes at 00 05 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 of each hour. Because game sessions may run continually it may be possible that a particular game session will have no game player playing in it within the particular game session.

In one embodiment the computer system may display the game s or the identity of the game player s closest to a winning combination during the game session. The computer system may also choose to display only one or a subset of all the game sessions or identities of such players to a particular game player playing or observing the game session.

If the game is played using a computer system advertisements sponsorships public service announcements or any visual or auditory content may be inserted into these periods. Advertisements and any other content may also be inserted into the game display during a game session.

In one embodiment of the present invention game sessions and game play are partially or fully automated and monitored using one or more computer systems. A computer system may be a single computer that may be a supercomputer minicomputer or a mainframe or personal computer. A computer system used to run a game and its associated sessions may include a combination of one or more computer systems of one or more computer system types that cooperate to accomplish system level tasks. The computer system also may include input or output devices displays or storage units. It should be appreciated that any computer system or systems may be used and the invention is not limited to any number type or configuration of computer systems.

A computer system to run the described game may have three component systems see . One system may handle payment subscription and or AMOE by players to enter the game. Another system may handle playing and viewing the game and the third system may handle payouts. The game system may also be connected by direct line or network to other computer systems including systems for handling casino or hotel loyalty programs reservations in room television viewing or gambling floor kiosks. Connections to other computer systems may be performed using one or more of the system components described below.

A payment component may be one or many of a number of well known systems see . For example a player may be able to pay to play one or more games using a telephone and speaking with a call center representative or who inputs player payment and subscription information into a computer using a user interface. A player may also pay to play using a cashier at a casino that also can enter the above information into a computer. In the computer data may manually be stored in a data structure that is stored in a memory of the computer system. As used herein a data structure is an arrangement of data defined by computer readable signals. These signals may be read by a computer system stored on a medium associated with a computer system e.g. in a memory on a disk etc. and may be transmitted to one or more other computer systems over a communications medium such as for example a network. Also as used herein a user interface or UI is an interface between a human user and a computer that enables communication between a user and a computer. Types of UIs include a graphical user interface GUI a display screen a mouse a keyboard a keypad a track ball a microphone e.g. to be used in conjunction with a voice recognition system a speaker a touch screen a game controller e.g. a joystick etc and any combinations thereof.

Player information may also be entered into a payment system component. Player information that may be input includes name address telephone number and age. Payment information associated with the player may include credit or debit card number or loyalty account information. Subscription information for games to which the player subscribes may include first game date and time number of games to play and bet per game. Based upon the payment and subscription information the call center representative may then verify that the payment information is valid and enough credit or funds is available for the player s desired subscription.

A similar system may exist for players entering using the mail or a post card AMOE except the call center may be replaced by a mail center with representatives entering information into a computer via a user interface. For example a cashier that works at a casino directly with players that pay cash or credit to play may also have the ability to input player account and subscription information using a user interface.

Computer systems or pay engines for handling electronic or online payment and subscriptions may also be used. Such systems are well known and include such systems as Pay Pal iKobo Verisign and other systems. Using such a system a player interacts directly with a user interface to input information into a payment data structure that may be transferred to one or more payment systems e.g. PayPal .

Various pay systems and one or more user interfaces may be located on one or more computer systems coupled by a network with the computer system s containing the player account and subscription database s . As used herein a network or a communications network is a group of two or more devices interconnected by one or more segments of transmission media on which communications may be exchanged between the devices.

The above are merely an illustrative embodiment of a pay system component. It should be appreciated that such an illustrative embodiment is not intended to limit the scope of the invention as any of numerous other implementations of a pay system component for example variations of online payment are possible and are intended to fall within the scope of the invention. For example the payment system component may include using pay per view systems associated with interactive television or the pay engine may additionally deliver a receipt to the player by either e mail or mail. None of the claims set forth below are intended to be limited to any particular implementation of the pay system unless such claim includes a limitation explicitly reciting a particular implementation.

Payout systems are also well known see . Any of a number of standard systems or payout engines for making payouts for winning may be used. For example a standard application programming interface such as Quicken Intuit Inc. Mountain View Calif. USA may be used to write and mail checks or credit a debit card credit card if legal in the jurisdiction of play or loyalty account. Quicken may obtain the payout information by accessing a payout data structure across a network. As used herein an application programming interface or API is a set of one or more computer readable instructions that provide access to one or more other sets of computer readable instructions that define functions so that such functions can be configured to be executed on a computer in conjunction with an application program.

 Quicken is merely an illustrative embodiment of the payout system. Such an illustrative embodiment is not intended to limit the scope of the invention as any of numerous other implementations of the payout system for example variations of online payout are possible and are intended to fall within the scope of the invention. Additionally a cashier e.g. at a casino may also have access to payout information using a user interface to the payout data structure through a network the cashier then makes a payment to the winning player based upon the accessed information. None of the claims set forth below are intended to be limited to any particular implementation of the pay system unless such claim includes a limitation explicitly reciting a particular implementation.

A game playing and viewing system may comprise of a number of components for performing specific functions e.g. see . These components may include for example storage components that store data structures that include information relating to storing game variations present game information game history and win history. A game playing and viewing system may also include components used to access payment and payout data structures.

A game playing and viewing system according to one embodiment may also include a game engine. A game engine may perform functions relating to conducting a game session of a keno type game. In one example a game engine may perform functions associated with a process as shown in . A player may play one or more game sessions in an associated interface of a computer system with the computer presenting in the associated interface a role keno type game to the player.

As shown in a process for conducting a keno type game may be performed. At block process begins. One or more systems that conduct the role playing game may permit a player to subscribe to one or more games at block . This may be performed for example through a cashier at a casino or through at lottery agent. The cashier may be capable of providing subscription and payment information to the payment system and game engine described above. However it should be appreciated that a player may subscribe and or pay using any number of methods and the invention is not limited to any particular subscription or payment method. The player may be permitted to subscribe to one or more sessions of a keno type game. These sessions may be played at some point in the future and may or may not be played within a legal gambling jurisdiction. Preferably a player may subscribe to multiple games during a day. In one embodiment of the invention the game provided is a keno type game and therefore the player may be assigned specific game times when paying to play.

At block the computer randomly chooses the numbers the player will try to match for each keno type game to which the player is subscribed and assigns the information to the payment ticket given to the player at block . The computer maintains this information for example in the storage associated with the game engine.

At block the player plays the game at a computer terminal and in one embodiment enters a website associated with the keno type game. In one example the computer terminal is located outside of a casino or other legal gambling jurisdiction. To play solitaire the player enters the ticket information at block . When the ticket information has been verified by the computer the computer recalls the numbers picked for the player for the game in progress at block and also recalls the previously chosen winning numbers for the game in progress at block .

The computer or player may choose display to the player any game session that has already been completed i.e. any game for which the winning numbers have already been chosen. Thus upon first sign on a player may enter for example the first game paid for the last game for which winning numbers have been chosen or any game in between.

At block the computer generates and displays a solitaire game to the player. depicts an example of what the computer screen may look like according to one embodiment of the invention. Elements include those associated with solitaire including for example card stacks foundation blocks and stock pile . The example arrangement shown corresponds to that of Klondike solitaire as described above.

A prize card may be identified by suit flashing symbols glowing aura or any other indicator and may be revealed at block . As the prize card is revealed one of the spinning reels may indicate either a match or no match between the associated player s number and a winning number for the game at block . For example a match may be indicated by a suit symbol spade diamond club or heart or any other symbol and a non match may be indicated by no symbol or any other symbol.

If the player is not finished playing solitaire at block the player may continue to reveal more prize cards and the computer continues to reveal whether each prize card represents a match or no match to the winning numbers.

When the player is finished playing solitaire is stuck or does not want to continue playing solitaire at block the computer reveals the rest of the prize cards and any further matches. The player can inform the computer to reveal all the matches by selecting Autofinish button or by any other method provided by the website. The player may decide not to play solitaire at all and can proceed straight to revealing the matches and receiving the pay out by selecting Autofinish button for example.

If the player is determined to be a winner at block then the computer may proceed to notify the player that he or she is a winner. Further the computer may determine any payout e.g. by following a pay out table as depicted by and notify the player of any payout. Winnings for this keno type game may according to one embodiment be completely determined by the number of matches and not by the speed quality nor any aspect of play associated with solitaire.

The computer may display the winning game and or player information to all the game players. Winning player information that may be displayed includes for example name city state and country. If multiple winners occur simultaneously all winners or winning games may be displayed at one time or sequentially. It may also be possible that winners or winning games may be selectively displayed to game players. For instance if numerous winners occur at one time a player in Bismarck N. Dak. may be shown only the winning player information or game that occurred closest to him or her say in Pierre S. Dak. versus some other location e.g. Boston Mass. . If the player has any winnings the player may then return to the casino to obtain them at block .

A player may also decide not to even enter the website.
