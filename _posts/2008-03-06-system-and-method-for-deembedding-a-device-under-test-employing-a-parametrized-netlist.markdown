The present invention relates to a system and methods for de embedding a device under test DUT by employing a parameterized netlist having a parameterized lumped element.

High frequency semiconductor devices are employed to form high frequency semiconductor circuits for communication and or logic operations. The high frequency semiconductor devices may be a metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor MOSFET a bipolar junction transistor BJT a passive device such as a capacitor or an inductor or any other semiconductor device that requires operation at a high frequency which is typically greater than 1 GHz.

To characterize the high frequency semiconductor devices high frequency measurements are required. High frequency measurement on a semiconductor device requires a pad set to allow access of a probe which may be a vector network analyzer VNA to the semiconductor device due to microscopic dimensions of the semiconductor device and macroscopic dimensions of the components of the probe. Thus the probe tests the semiconductor device by transmitting signals to and receiving signals from the semiconductor device through the pad set. An inherent consequence of the use of the pad set is that a device test structure DTS or the structure tested by the probe is not an isolated semiconductor device which is herein referred to as an intrinsic device or device under test DUT but a combination of the intrinsic device and the pad set. In other words any test data from the DUT invariably involves effects of parasitic components of the pad set that are external to the DUT. The DUT is embedded in the device test structure in the sense that any measurement on the intrinsic device must be performed through the entirety of the device test structure which contains the DUT and the pad set.

Test result obtained from the device test structure includes parasitic effects of the pad set. To extract device characteristics of the DUT the device characteristics of the inherent device need to be de embedded from the measured data of the DTS since the device characteristics of the inherent device are embedded within the measured data by virtue of the embedding of the inherent device within the DTS. In general the pad set introduces significant parasitic effects at high measurement frequencies.

Referring to a DTS containing a DUT and a pad set is shown. If each of the DTS and the DUT is treated as a 2 port network respectively the pad set that generates the parasitic effect on the intrinsic device is a 4 port network. The electrical effect of the pad set is herein referred to as the pad set parasitics. The first port of the 4 port network comprises a port of the DTS. The second port of the 4 port network comprises another port of the DTS. The third port of the 4 port network comprises a connection point to the DUT. The fourth port of the 4 port network comprises another connection point to the DUT.

Unfortunately the 4 port network and the DUT are unknown. All measurement data is based on measurement on the DTS as a whole. To facilitate de embedding of the measurement data calibration standards are used to estimate and subtract the effects of the pad set parasitics of the 4 port network. Exemplary calibration standards include an open dummy or an open network a short dummy or a short network a thru dummy or a thru network the structures and netlist representations of which are described in Table 1.

Traditionally de embedding is performed in two steps. Commonly used prior art de embedding method is open short O S de embedding which requires two additional calibration standards of an open dummy and a short dummy. The open short de embedding simplifies the 4 port network by assuming that dominant parasitics are either near the probe pad or near the DUT and are not distributed.

Referring to an equivalent circuit for the 4 port network according to the O S de embedding method is shown. The equivalent circuit according to the O S de embedding comprises a first open parasitics component A a second open parasitics component B and a third open parasitics component C. The first open parasitics component A is connected directly between the two nodes of the first port of the 4 port network which is a first port of the DTS. The second open parasitics component B is connected directly between the two nodes of the second port of the 4 port network which is a second port of the DTS. The third open parasitics component C is connected between a signal node marked with a sign as opposed to a ground node that is marked with a sign of the first port of the 4 port network and a signal node of the second port of the 4 port network.

The equivalent circuit according to the O S de embedding further comprises a first short parasitics component A a second short parasitics component B and a third short parasitics component C. The first short parasitics component A is connected directly between the signal node of the first port of the 4 port network and a signal node of the third node of the 4 port network which is a first port of the DUT. The second short parasitics component B is connected directly between the signal node of the second port of the 4 port network and a signal node of the fourth node of the 4 port network which is a second port of the DUT. The third short parasitics component C is connected directly between the combined ground nodes between which no parasitic components are assumed to be present in the O S de embedding method of the third and fourth ports of the 4 port network and the combined ground nodes between which no parasitic components are assumed to be present in the O S de embedding method of the first and second ports of the 4 port network.

Referring to a prior art open short O S de embedding method is shown in a flow chart. Referring to step scattering parameter S parameter data is measured on the embedded device test structure containing the device under test DUT and the pad set. Scattering parameters are parameters that describe electrical behavior of a linear electrical network subjected to steady state stimuli by small electrical signals. In general various electrical properties of the linear electrical network such as signal gain return loss voltage standing wave ratio refection coefficient and amplifier stability may be described with S parameters. The idea behind the S parameters is that the response of the linear electrical network may be considered as scattering of an input signal within the linear electrical network. Of particular concern for estimating the pad set parasitics with the prior art O S de embedding method are Y parameters that represent admittance of the 4 port network and Z parameters that represent impedance of the 4 port network.

Referring to step the measured S parameters are converted to Y parameters. Methods of converting S parameters to Y parameters in a 2 port network are known in the art. Specifically U.S. Pat. No. 7 075 312 to Fabry et al. U.S. Pat. Nos. 7 026 829 and 7 071 707 to Tiemeijer U.S. Pat. No. 6 961 669 to Brunsman U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 832 170 and 6 665 628 to Martens U.S. Pat. No. 6 815 964 to Di Gregorio et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6 211 541 to Carroll et al. are incorporated herein. It is noted that the S parameters Y parameters and Z parameters of a 2 port network are given by 2 2 matrices.

Referring to step calculations for subtracting open parasitics i.e. the collective parasitics of the first open parasitics component A the second open parasitics component B and the third open parasitics component C are performed at a predetermined frequency. The first operation calculates an open de embedded DTS admittance Y which is the admittance of the set of the DUT and the short parasitics i.e. the collective parasitics of the first short parasitics component A the second short parasitics component B and the third short parasitics component C. The open de embedded DTS admittance Yis given by Equation 1 wherein Yis the calculated admittance of the DTS that contains the DUT the open parasitics and the short parasitics and wherein Yis the calculated admittance of an open dummy that is supposed to contain only the open parasitics. The calculated admittance of the DTS Yand the calculated admittance of the open dummy Yare based on the S parameters of the DTS and the open dummy that are measured at the predetermined frequency.

The second operation calculated a short de embedded DTS admittance Y which is the admittance of the short parasitics that contains the collective parasitics of the first short parasitics component A the second short parasitics component B and the third short parasitics component C. The short de embedded DTS admittance Yis given by Equation 2 wherein Yis the calculated admittance of a short dummy that is supposed to contain the open parasitics and the short parasitics. The calculated admittance of the short dummy Yis based on the S parameters of the short dummy that are measured at the predetermined frequency.

Referring to step a DUT Z parameter which is the Z parameter of the DUT is calculated. The DUT Z parameter Zis given by Equation 3 wherein Yis the inverse matrix of the open de embedded DTS admittance Yand Yis the inverse matrix of the short de embedded DTS admittance Y.

Referring to step the DUT Z parameter Zis converted back to an S parameter. It is noted that the manipulation of measured S parameters is done for the preset frequency and that there is no fitting or any variable parameter in the prior art O S de embedding method. Thus execution of one round of the calculation process provides DUT Z parameter Zat one frequency. To generate a frequency dependent profile for DUT Z parameter Z the calculation process is repeated at multiple frequencies one frequency at a time.

While the open short O S de embedding method provides a simple scheme for estimating the pad set parametrics the assumption on dominant parametrics and nature of distribution of the pad set parametrics is not true in many cases and introduces significant errors especially at high frequency e.g. in GHz frequency ranges and above. This problem becomes more profound in noise de embedding particularly in bulk complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS technology which employs a bulk substrate that induces a large signal loss.

Some other de embedding techniques have been proposed in the prior art to enhance accuracy of estimation of the 4 port network representing the pad set parasitics. For example a three step de embedding method employing 3 calibration standards and assuming a 9 element network for the 4 port network is known in the art. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006 0114004 A1 to Tiemeijer that discloses the three step de embedding method is herein incorporated by reference. A 4 port de embedding method employing 4 to 6 calibration standards and assuming a 15 element network for the 4 port network is also known in the art. Q. Liang et al. A Simple Four Port Parasitic Deembedding Methodology for High Frequency Scattering Parameter and Noise Characterization of SiGe HBTs IEEE Trans. Microwave Theory and Techniques v. 51 n. 11 pp. 2165 2174 2003 that discloses the complete de embedding method is herein incorporated by reference. However use of additional calibration standards to enhance accuracy of the de embedding increases device characterization cost both by increasing a total test structure area on a semiconductor chip and by increasing the complexity of testing and data analysis. While benefits of use of increased number of calibration standards are known the prior art methods also incur significant increase in cost oftentimes rendering the characterization methods uneconomical.

In view of the above there exists a need for an improved system and methods for representing the 4 port network of the pad set with an enhanced accuracy in the estimation of the of the pad set parasitics.

Further there exists a need for an improved system and methods for de embedding a device test structure in which a device under test DUT is embedded to extract device characteristics of the DUT with an enhanced accuracy.

Thus the fitting method is a multi frequency fitting for the at least one parameterized lumped element. A 4 port Y parameter admittance parameter is obtained from the fitted parameterized netlist.

As stated above the present invention relates to a system and methods for de embedding a device under test DUT by employing a parameterized netlist having a parameterized lumped element which are now described in detail with accompanying figures. It is noted that like and corresponding elements mentioned herein and illustrated in the drawings are referred to by like reference numerals.

Referring to an exemplary equivalent circuit for pad set parasitics according to the present invention comprises at least one parameterized lumped element each of which may be a resistor a capacitor an inductor a current source a voltage source a transmission line and any other lumped element. In general a lumped element model employs lumped elements and perfectly conducting connections between the lumped elements to generate a lumped element network that approximates an electronic circuit. This is in contrast with a distributed element model or a transmission line model which employs distributed elements that are infinitesimal in size and connected by wires that have a finite impedance to generate a distributed element network that approximates an electronic circuit or a transmission line. For the purposes of the present invention the exemplary equivalent circuit is a parameterized lumped element network for the pad set parasitics.

At least one of the lumped elements in the exemplary equivalent circuit is a parameterized lumped element i.e. a lumped element that is parameterized and having a variable value that may be changed and or fitted. The exemplary equivalent circuit may also contain some constant lumped elements i.e. lumped elements that are not parameterized and have a constant value. The at least one parameterized lumped element may comprise a resistor having a parameterized frequency independent dependent resistance value a capacitor having a parameterized frequency independent dependent capacitance value and or an inductor having a parameterized frequency independent dependent inductance value. A constant lumped element if present may comprise a resistor having a constant frequency independent dependent resistance value a capacitor having a constant frequency independent dependent capacitance value and or an inductor having a constant frequency independent dependent inductance value.

Specifically the exemplary equivalent circuit in comprises 12 resistors 10 capacitors and 5 inductors between a first signal node of a first port a second signal node of a second port a gate node of a transistor not shown a drain node of the transistor and a source node of the transistor. In this case the transistor is a device under test DUT . The exemplary equivalent circuit contains gate pad parasitics which are parasitic components of a physical gate pad structure and drain pad parasitics which are parasitic components of a physical drain pad structure. The exemplary equivalent circuit also contains wiring parasitics which are parasitic components of the device test structure DTS due to wiring components of the pad set excluding the physical gate pad structure and the physical drain pad structure. For example the wiring components include all back end of line wiring structures beneath the physical gate pad structure and the physical drain pad structure. The DTS comprises the pad set and the DUT. The present invention is not limited by the exemplary equivalent circuit and may be practiced with any model for the pad set parasitics that contains at least one parameterized lumped element.

Any subset of the 12 resistors 10 capacitors and 5 inductors in the exemplary equivalent circuit may be the at least one parameterized lumped element. Thus the number of the at least one parameterized lumped element may be 1 or any number up to the total number of the parameterized lumped elements and the constant lumped elements in the exemplary equivalent circuit. Each of the parameterized lumped element has a frequency independent resistance variable a frequency independent inductance variable or a frequency independent capacitance variable.

Referring to a flow chart illustrating a method for extracting pad set parasitics from a device test structure DTS according to a first embodiment of the present invention is shown. The DTS embeds a device under test DUT and contains a pad set having pad set parasitics that may be modeled with a lumped element model having at least one parameterized lumped element as described above.

Referring to step scattering parameter S parameter data is measured on the DTS that embeds the DUT. Further scattering parameter data is also measured on at least one calibration standard which includes at least one of an open dummy a short dummy and a thru dummy. Preferably the at least one calibration standard includes the open dummy and the short dummy. The S parameter measurements on the DTS and the at least one calibration standard are performed at multiple frequencies employing a test equipment such as a vector network analyzer VNA . The measurement frequencies may be at or above 1 GHz.

Referring to step a parameterized netlist containing a lumped element network for the pad set parasitics of the DTS and representing the pad set parasitics of the DTS is generated. For example the parameterized netlist may represent the exemplary equivalent circuit of which is a parameterized lumped element network for the pad set parasitics of a DTS. The lumped element network is a parameterized lumped element network since at least one of the lumped elements in the lumped element network is parameterized i.e. is a variable that may be changed and or fitted.

Preferably an initial value a lower bound and an upper bound are provided for each of the at least one parameterized lumped element in the parameterized netlist for future fitting purposes. For example in the first exemplary parameterized netlist described above the parameterized lumped element C18 shown in the first line of code after BEGIN COMMON line contains an initial value of 1.98438e 14 a lower bound of 10e 15 and an upper bound of 100e 15. The presence of a lower bound and an upper bound for each of the at least one parameterized lumped element helps facilitate convergence of fitting of S parameter data in subsequent steps.

The parameterized netlist may contain some constant lumped elements i.e. lumped elements having a constant value for resistance capacitance or inductance. As described above the at least one parameterized lumped element may comprise a resistor having a parameterized frequency independent resistance value a capacitor having a parameterized frequency independent capacitance value and or an inductor having a parameterized frequency independent inductance value. A constant lumped element if present may comprise a resistor having a constant frequency independent resistance value a capacitor having a constant frequency independent capacitance value and or an inductor having a constant frequency independent inductance value.

Referring to step the measured S parameter data from the DTS and the at least one calibration standard is fitted with the parameterized netlist employing the at least one parameterized lumped element as a set of at least one fitting parameter. A genetic algorithm for fitting data may be employed. A genetic algorithm performs iterative calculations to induce convergence of a total fitting error to a minimum value.

According to the present invention the fitting is performed across all measurement frequencies. Thus the collective set of the S parameter data on the DTS and the at least one calibration standard across all measurement frequencies is fitted with the parameterized netlist. In principle as long as the total number of independent measurement data points in the collective set of the S parameter data exceeds the total number of the at least one parameterized lumped element a complete set of values may be obtained for all of the at least one parameterized lumped element. Since the number of measurement frequencies may be increased without limit a parameterized netlist having any positive integer for the number of the at least one parameterized lumped element may be fitted by increasing the number of measurement frequencies for the collective set of the S parameter data on the DTS and the at least one calibration standard. In practice the number of the at least one parameterized lumped element is optimized to facilitate fitting of the collective set of the S parameter data on the DTS and the at least one calibration standard with a high confidence level.

The collective set of the S parameter data on the DTS and the at least one calibration standard across all measurement frequencies is employed simultaneously for fitting of the at least one parameterized lumped element. Each of the at least one parameterized lumped element is simultaneously fitted with the rest of the at least one parameterized lumped element as the generic algorithm simultaneously fits the collective set of the S parameter data. In other words an optimization criteria for the set of the at least one parameterized lumped element is to fit all measured S parameter data across all measured frequency. A computer program may be employed to obtain an optimal fitted value or a fitted parameterized lumped element value for each of the at least one parameterized lumped element.

Referring to step a 4 port Y parameter for the lumped element network of the pad set parasitics is calculated from the parameterized netlist and the set of at least one optimal fitted value. The lumped element network has a fixed value which is the optimal fitted value for each of the lumped components within the lumped element network. Each of the constant lumped elements if any is present in the lumped element network has a constant value for the resistance capacitance or inductance of the constant lumped element. Each of the at least one parameterized lumped element in the lumped element network has the optimal fitted value for the resistance capacitance or inductance of the parameterized lumped element.

Thus the values of all lumped components are known for the parameterized lumped element network that is represented by the parameterized netlist after the fitting of the collective set of the S parameter data. The pad set parasitics may be represented by a frequency dependent formula for each component of the 4 port Y parameter of the parameterized netlist which is now provided with a fitted value for each of the parameterized lumped element. Thus each component of the 4 port Y parameter for the pad set parasitics according to the present invention is given by an analytic function having frequency dependence that may be interpolated and extrapolated by an analytic function outside the range of measurement frequencies. An analytic function is a function that is locally given by a convergent power series. The analytic function may be a power series of frequency.

Referring to step a parameterized netlist containing a lumped element network for the pad set parasitics of the DTS and representing the pad set parasitics of the DTS is generated as in step of i.e. the parameterized netlist is the same as in the first embodiment of the present invention described above. The parameterized netlist contains a first lumped element network that models the pad set parasitics of the DTS with at least one first parameterized lumped element. The first lumped element network of the second embodiment is the same as the lumped element network of the first embodiment. The at least one first parameterized lumped element of the second embodiment is the same as the at least one parameterized lumped element of the first embodiment.

Preferably an initial value a lower bound and an upper bound are provided for each of the at least one first parameterized lumped element in the parameterized netlist for future fitting purposes. The parameterized netlist may contain constant lumped elements i.e. lumped elements having a constant value for resistance capacitance or inductance. The at least one first parameterized lumped element may comprise a resistor having a parameterized frequency independent resistance value a capacitor having a parameterized frequency independent capacitance value and or an inductor having a parameterized frequency independent inductance value. A constant lumped element if present may comprise a resistor having a constant frequency independent resistance value a capacitor having a constant frequency independent capacitance value and or an inductor having a constant frequency independent inductance value.

Referring to step a second lumped element network representing the DUT is added to the parameterized netlist. The second lumped element network contains at least one second parameterized lumped element. Thus the parameterized netlist now contains the first lumped element network that models the pad set parasitics of the DTS and the second lumped element network that models the DUT. The added portion of the parameterized netlist may be a module that contains the second lumped element network. An exemplary module for the second lumped element network is shown below.

Preferably an initial value a lower bound and an upper bound are provided for each of the at least one second parameterized lumped element in the parameterized netlist for future fitting purposes. The second lumped element network portion of the parameterized netlist may contain some constant lumped elements i.e. lumped elements having a constant value for resistance capacitance or inductance.

Referring to step the measured S parameter data from the DTS and the at least one calibration standard is fitted with the parameterized netlist employing the at least one first parameterized lumped element and the at least one second parameterized lumped element as fitting parameters. A generic algorithm for fitting data may be employed as in the first embodiment.

According to the present invention the fitting is performed across all measurement frequencies. Thus the collective set of the S parameter data on the DTS and the at least one calibration standard across all measurement frequencies is fitted with the parameterized netlist. In principle as long as the total number of independent measurement data points in the collective set of the S parameter data exceeds the total number of the at least one first parameterized lumped element and the at least one second parameterized lumped element a complete set of values may be obtained for all of the at least one first parameterized lumped element and the at least one second parameterized lumped element. Since the number of measurement frequencies may be increased without limit a parameterized netlist having any positive integer for the total number of the at least one first parameterized lumped element and the at least one second parameterized lumped element may be fitted by increasing the number of measurement frequencies for the collective set of the S parameter data on the DTS and the at least one calibration standard. In practice the total number of the at least one first parameterized lumped element and the at least one second parameterized lumped element is optimized to facilitate fitting of the collective set of the S parameter data on the DTS and the at least one calibration standard with a high confidence level.

The collective set of the S parameter data on the DTS and the at least one calibration standard across all measurement frequencies is employed simultaneously for fitting of the at least one parameterized lumped element. Each of the at least one first parameterized lumped element and the at least one second parameterized lumped element is simultaneously fitted with the rest of the at least one first parameterized lumped element and the at least one second parameterized lumped element as the generic algorithm simultaneously fits the collective set of the S parameter data. In other words optimization criteria for the set of the at least one first parameterized lumped element and the at least one second parameterized lumped element is to fit all measured S parameter data across all measured frequency. A computer program may be employed to obtain an optimal fitted value or a fitted parameterized lumped element value for each of the at least one parameterized lumped element the at least one first parameterized lumped element and the at least one second parameterized lumped element.

Referring to step a 4 port Y parameter for the first lumped element network of the pad set parasitics is calculated from the first lumped element network portion of the parameterized netlist and the set of at least one optimal fitted value for each of the at least one first parameterized lumped element. The first lumped element network has a fixed value which is one of the optimal fitted values for each of the first lumped components within the first lumped element network. Each of the constant lumped elements if any is present in the first lumped element network has a constant value for the resistance capacitance or inductance of the constant lumped element. Each of the at least one first parameterized lumped element in the first lumped element network has the optimal fitted value for the resistance capacitance or inductance of the parameterized first lumped element.

Thus the values of all lumped components are known for the pad set parasitics that is represented by the first lumped element network portion of the parameterized netlist after the fitting of the collective set of the S parameter data. The pad set parasitics may be represented by a frequency dependent formula for each component of the 4 port Y parameter of the first lumped element network portion of the parameterized netlist which is now provided with a fitted value for each of the first parameterized lumped element. Thus each component of the 4 port Y parameter for the pad set parasitics according to the present invention is given by an analytic function having frequency dependence that may be interpolated and extrapolated by an analytic function outside the range of measurement frequencies.
