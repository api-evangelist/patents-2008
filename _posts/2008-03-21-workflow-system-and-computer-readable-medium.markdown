This application is based on and claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 from Japanese Patent Application No. 2007 255249 filed Sep. 28 2007.

Generally there has been a workflow system for managing various business processes such as a circulation a request for decision and a consensual decision. As exemplarily shown in a workflow is made by connecting tasks to each other such as purchase request entry purchase request approval and purchase acceptance in a process of purchasing articles in accordance with business flow and is established in accordance with business contents. In addition in the tasks constituting the workflow at least one person in charge is assigned and when a task is accomplished an instruction for starting the next task is notified to a person in charge of the next task in the current workflow. As described above the workflow system is configured to be able to effectively manage business progress in accordance with the established workflow.

According to an aspect of the present invention a workflow system includes a workflow storage that stores workflows built by connecting a plurality of tasks assigned to persons in charge respectively a task extracting unit that extracts at least one task from each of two or more of the workflows stored in the workflow storage a site creation unit that creates a conference site of which an access authority is given to the persons in charge of the tasks extracted by the task extracting unit and in which electronic information is shared and an access controller that controls access to the conference site created by the site creation unit in accordance with the authority.

The user information storage section includes at least one of a storage device such as a hard disk device and a memory element such as a RAM or a ROM and the user information storage section stores various information about a user of the information managing system . Specifically in association with a user ID for identifying a user the user information storage section stores a user name a login password used in a user certification at the time when the user logs in to the information managing system and a group including the user.

The workflow system is a server computer that is known to all and has a data communication section such as a LAN card and a storage section such as a hard disk and manages workflows see built by connecting a plurality of tasks assigned to at least one person in charge according to business flow. The workflow system can manages not only a workflow in which a plurality of tasks is connected in one direction but also a complex workflow including condition divergence at which a task of a transition destination is changed depending on a condition and a re execution process of re executing an executed task.

The bulletin board system is a server computer that is known to all and has a data communication section such as a LAN card and a storage section such as a hard disk and in view of function includes a bulletin board control section and a bulletin board information storage section .

The bulletin board control section is formed as a program for controlling CPU and an operation of CPU and controls the respective sections of the bulletin board system . For example according to request of a user or an instruction of the workflow system an electronic bulletin board hereinafter it is referred to as simply bulletin board is created and the created bulletin board is provided to a user terminal. In the bulletin board a plurality of users can post and read information such as a message and an electronic file. Access to the bulletin board is controlled by a bulletin board access authority a conference authority a read authority and a null authority that belongs to the respective users.

The bulletin board information storage section stores various information on a bulletin board created by the bulletin board control section . For example in association with a bulletin board ID for identifying a bulletin board the bulletin board information storage section stores a user ID belonging to a user who participates in the bulletin board a title of the bulletin board and a document and an electronic file posted on the bulletin board.

In the information managing system having the configuration when an event satisfying a predetermined condition occurs at least one task related to the condition is extracted from each of two or more workflows managed by the workflow system and the bulletin board for conferring between persons in charge of the extracted tasks is created by the bulletin board system . Specifically the persons in charge of the tasks extracted from the two or more workflows can confer with each other by using the information managing system .

A user terminal not shown in the drawings is a computer terminal known to all for example a personal computer having a display section such as a display an input section such as a keyboard and a mouse and a data communication section such as a LAN card. In the user terminal there is stored a program a web browser an exclusive application and the like for building a workflow in the workflow system executing tasks included in the workflow reading the bulletin board provided by the bulletin board system and posting information on the bulletin board.

As shown in the workflow system in view of function includes a workflow control section a condition storage section and a workflow information storage section .

The workflow information storage section stores various information related to a workflow managed by the workflow system . Specifically the workflow information storage section stores a workflow ID for identifying a workflow an case name which is a name of the workflow information a task ID for identifying a task a task name a task content person in charge information such as a person in charge ID a task access authority representing whether access to the task is allowable or not and time limit of the task related to tasks constituting the workflow information representing a task connection order progress control information for controlling progress of the workflow the other attribute information and the like.

As for the workflows managed by the workflow system there are a workflow built when a user connects random tasks to each other in random order and a workflow built based on workflow definition in which tasks constituting the business and a connection order of the tasks are previously defined for every representative business process. For example in workflow definition of purchase request there is previously defined a form a template of a workflow in which tasks such as purchase request entry purchase request approval and purchase acceptance are connected in order. The workflow definition including a definition name is also stored in the workflow information storage section .

The workflow control section is formed of a program for controlling a CPU and an operation of the CPU and controls the respective sections of the workflow system . Particularly the workflow control section includes a condition registration section a condition monitoring section a task extracting section a bulletin board creation instruction section a workflow progress control section a change instruction receiving section a task access authority changing section . The workflow control section executes various processes for managing the workflow. The CPU executes the program stored in a storage section such as a hard disk device and thus these functions are embodied. The program may be provided through a communication network such as an internet and may be also provided by being stored in various computer readable recording mediums such as a flexible disk a CD ROM and a DVD ROM.

The condition registration section registers bulletin board creation condition which is a condition for creating bulletin board in the bulletin board system on the condition storage section to be described later on the basis of condition registration instruction received from the user terminal. In addition in association with the bulletin board creation condition the condition registration section registers task extracting condition which is a condition for extracting a task and conference attribute information which represents an attribute related to a conference in the created bulletin board on the condition storage section . Here the condition registration instruction received form the user terminal will be described in detail.

In the screen there are provided conference message and conference time limit for designating conference attribute information. To the space of conference message a user can designate a message displayed on the bulletin board created when the bulletin board creation condition is satisfied or included in the notification to the effect that a bulletin board is created . To the space of conference time limit the user can also designate time limit in which the conference in the created bulletin board should be concluded for example a period during one week or an absolute date until Mar. 31 2007 a combination of information time limit of a workflow including tasks time limit of the tasks the total number of the persons in charge of tasks degree of persons in charge skill and the like related to the tasks satisfying a task extracting condition to be described later and the like.

The task extracting condition is designated in association with the bulletin board creation condition. Hence the screen is configured to be displayed in association with the screen shown in . For example the screen shown in may be displayed after decision button is pressed on the screen shown in and may be displayed with the screen shown in .

The bulletin board creation condition the conference attribute information and the task extracting condition designated in the manner as described above are transmitted as a condition registration instruction from the user terminal to the workflow system . In this case the condition registration section registers on the condition storage section these information included in the condition registration instruction. is a diagram illustrating exemplary information registered in a condition storage section by a condition registration section . As described in the drawing the condition storage section stores the bulletin board creation condition the task extracting condition and the conference attribute information in association with condition ID for identifying the bulletin board creation condition.

The condition monitoring section monitors whether the bulletin board creation condition stored in the condition storage section is established or not. In addition when an event causing the bulletin board creation condition to be established occurs the condition ID representing the current bulletin board creation condition is notified to the task extracting section . The condition monitoring section may check whether the bulletin board creation condition is established or not in a predetermined cycle and may check whether the bulletin board creation condition is established or not whenever progress situation of the workflow stored in the workflow information storage section is changed.

The task extracting section extracts at lest one task from each of the two or more workflows stored in the workflow information storage section on the basis of a monitoring result from the condition monitoring section . Specifically from the condition storage section the task extracting section acquires the conference attribute information and the task extracting condition stored in association with the condition ID notified by the condition monitoring section . In addition from the workflow information storage section the task extracting section extracts a task satisfying the acquired task extracting condition and acquires information of a person in charge of the task. In this case when the number of workflows including the extracted tasks is two or more the task extracting section outputs to the bulletin board creation instruction section a conference attribute information and a person in charge ID a user ID of a person in charge included in the acquired person in charge information. Conversely when the number of workflows including the extracted tasks is not more than one the task extracting section does not give an output to the bulletin board creation instruction section .

The bulletin board creation instruction section creates on the bulletin board system a bulletin board for conferring between persons in charge of tasks extracted by the task extracting section . Specifically to the bulletin board system the bulletin board creation instruction section transmits a bulletin board creation instruction including the conference attribute information and the person in charge ID inputted from the task extracting section .

When the bulletin board creation instruction transmitted from the workflow system the bulletin board creation instruction section is received the bulletin board system creates the bulletin board based on the bulletin board creation instruction. Specifically the bulletin board control section creates a bulletin board based on the conference attribute information a conference message a conference time limit or the like included in the bulletin board creation instruction. In addition conference authority for conferring on the bulletin board is given to the persons in charge so that the persons in charge identified by the person in charge ID included in the bulletin board creation instruction become participants. In addition the bulletin board control section stores the various information described above about the created bulletin board in the bulletin board information storage section and replies the bulletin board ID for identifying the bulletin board to the workflow system .

In the bulletin board created in the manner as described above for example conference message included in the conference attribute information is posted as initial information. In addition the bulletin board control section may end the conference in the created bulletin board according to elapse of conference time limit included in the conference attribute information.

When the workflow system receives the bulletin board ID replied from the bulletin board system the bulletin board creation instruction section as shown in stores the task IDs of the tasks extracted by the task extracting section in association with the received bulletin board ID. The bulletin board creation instruction section may store these information in the storage section.

In the same manner as described above when the bulletin board is created in the bulletin board system an object of creating the bulletin board is notified to the person in charge who is a participant of the bulletin board by a predetermined notification method a notice of a top page of the information managing system an electronic mail and the like . The person in charge receiving the notification participates in the bulletin board created by using the user terminal and can confer with the other participant through the bulletin board.

The workflow progress control section restricts progress of the two or more workflows including the tasks associating with the current bulletin board until the bulletin board is created by the bulletin board system and the conference is ended in the bulletin board. Specifically when the bulletin board ID is replied from the bulletin board system the workflow progress control section acquires the task ID managed in association with the bulletin board ID from the bulletin board creation instruction section . In addition the workflow progress control section changes the progress control information stored in the workflow information storage section so as to restrict the progress of the workflow including the tasks identified by the acquired task ID.

When the workflow progress is restricted in the manner as described above any person in charge belonging to the current workflow can not execute the task until the progress restriction is released. Hence until the conference in the bulletin board is ended it is possible to suppress error progression of the workflow subjected to the conference.

When the conference in the bulletin board is ended for example when a predetermined message representing conference end is posted on the bulletin board when conference end button provided on a predetermined position in the bulletin board is pressed or when conference time limit set in the bulletin board is elapsed the bulletin board system sends to the workflow system a notification to the effect that the conference in the current bulletin board is ended. In addition the workflow progress control section changes the progress control information stored in the workflow information storage section so as to release the progress restriction of the workflow subjected to the conference.

From persons in charge of tasks extracted at least by the task extracting section the change instruction receiving section receives a change instruction of an authority a task access authority of access to the tasks see to be described later . The change instruction of the task access authority includes the task ID of the task changing the task access authority the person in charge ID of the person in charge capable of giving or revoking the task access authority and a type an access authority or an execution authority of the task access authority given or revoked. To a specific person in charge of the persons in charge participating in the conference it is allowed to give an authority for changing an access authority to a task other than the task of the specific person in charge.

The task access authority changing section changes the task access authority of the task related to the change instruction stored in the workflow information storage section in accordance with the change instruction received by the change instruction receiving section .

Hereinafter a process related to change of the task access authority will be described in detail with reference to a case where three workflows of purchase request PC A001 purchase request mouse purchase request and CD R purchase request shown in is managed by the workflow system . The condition storage section stores the bulletin board creation condition see where sum of a workflow attribute request amount based on a workflow definition purchase request exceeds attribute estimated amount the task extracting condition see where workflow definition is purchase request and a task name is purchase request approval and the conference attribute information see including conference message or conference time limit in association with each other.

When the event causing the bulletin board creation condition to be established occurs the task three tasks of purchase request approval surrounded by a dashed line in satisfying the task extracting condition associating with the bulletin board creation condition is extracted the bulletin board in which the persons in charge D E and F of the extracted task is participated is created in the bulletin board system . In this case notification for example a message including conference message or conference time limit included in the conference attribute information associating with the bulletin board creation condition to the effect that the bulletin board is created in order to confer on the purchase request approval tasks is sent to the persons in charge D E and F. The person in charge D E and F who received the notification participate in a bulletin board provided by the bulletin board system and confer with the other participant through the bulletin board by using the user terminals respectively.

Next the bulletin board creation instruction section transmits to the bulletin board system the bulletin board creation instruction including the conference attribute information acquired from the step S and the person in charge ID acquired from the step S so as to create the bulletin board in which the person in charge identified by the person in charge ID acquired from the step S participates S .

When the bulletin board is created by the bulletin board system the bulletin board creation instruction section stores the task IDs of the tasks extracted from the step S in association with the bulletin board ID replied from the bulletin board system S . Next the workflow progress control section restricts the progress of the two or more workflows including the tasks associating with the created bulletin board until the conference in the created bulletin board is ended S S N . Meanwhile when the change instruction receiving section waits the change instruction of the access authority to the tasks extracted from the step S S S N and there is a change instruction of the access authority to any one of the tasks S Y the task access authority changing section changes the access authority to the task related to the instruction in accordance with the change instruction S . In addition when the conference in the created bulletin board is ended S Y the workflow progress control section releases the progress restriction of the workflows in the step S S .

The workflow system may store in log a change history of the task access authority or the conference content in the bulletin board in association with the tasks extracted from the step S.

As described above in the information managing system according to the embodiment when an event causing the previously registered bulletin board creation condition to be established occurs at least one task related to the condition is extracted from each of the two or more workflows managed by the workflow system . In addition the bulletin board for conferring between the persons in charge of the extracted tasks is created in the bulletin board system . That is it is possible to create a site for conferring between the persons in charge of the tasks extracted from the two or more workflows.

For example in the information managing system the following elements are registered respectively. When sum of request amount which is an attribute of the workflow built on the basis of purchase request which is the workflow definition exceeds estimated amount which is an attribute thereof is registered as the bulletin board creation condition. Purchase expected amount exceeds estimated amount is registered as the conference message. Recent due date of due dates of the workflow built on the basis of purchase request which is a workflow definition is registered as the conference time limit. All tasks being executed of the tasks included in the workflow built on the basis of purchase request which is a workflow definition is registered as the task extracting condition. With such a configuration the bulletin board for determining which purchase request is accepted is automatically created when the bulletin board creation condition is established. In addition the conference time limit in the bulletin board is set so as to end the conference before time limit of any one of the workflows arrives. When the conference time limit is determined on the basis of the number of the persons in charge of the tasks satisfying the task extracting condition the conference time limit is appropriately set in accordance with the number of persons participating in the conference.

In addition it is possible to automatically create the bulletin board for conferring between the persons in charge of the workflow which has high abnormal end rate the workflow considered that the workflow definition itself has a problem on the correspondence thereof when the following elements are registered respectively. When the abnormal end rate of the workflow built on the basis of purchase request which is a workflow definition is 50 or more is registered as the bulletin board creation condition. The case where the workflow of purchase request is abnormally ended is increasing is registered as the conference message. All tasks included in the workflow built on the basis of purchase request which is a workflow definition is registered as the task extracting condition.

In addition for example it is possible to automatically create on Apr. 1 2007 the bulletin board for adjusting in one month a task related to a project to be ended on Mar. 31 2007 when the following elements are set respectively. When Apr. 1 2007 arrives is set as the bulletin board creation condition. Due date of a corporation case project arrives is set as the conference message. One month is set as the conference time limit. All tasks being executed of the tasks included in the workflow of which an attribute project name is a corporation case project is set as the task extracting condition.

The invention is not limited to the embodiment mentioned above and may be modified to various forms of the embodiment. For example in the description mentioned above the invention is applied to the information managing system including the workflow system and the bulletin board system but the invention is applicable to a single bodied workflow system having a function of creating a conference site. In addition the conference site is not limited to the bulletin board but may be a site capable of exchanging information by using a chatting an electronic mail or the like.
