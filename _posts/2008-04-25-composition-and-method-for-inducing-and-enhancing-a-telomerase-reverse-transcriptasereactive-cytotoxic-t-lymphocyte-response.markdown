This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 09 788 110 filed Feb. 15 2001 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 388 071 which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 182 685 filed Feb. 15 2000.

The present invention concerns vaccines effective for treating cancer. This invention particularly concerns a universal cancer vaccine involving telomerase reverse transcriptase as a specific tumor antigen a method for its use for targeting cytotoxic T lymphocytes to tumor cells and a method for induction and or augmentation of a cancer patient s immune response against his tumor.

Various publications are referenced within this application. The disclosures within these publications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties into this application so that the state of art to which this invention pertains is more fully described.

The prevalent cancer treatments of choice heretofore are surgery radiation chemotherapy or a combination thereof. With the exception of a very few cancers prognosis has not been very satisfactory resulting in death of the patient after sometimes horrendous suffering from the treatments themselves.

Many medical research laboratories throughout the world are doing research directed towards developing effective non invasive treatments for arresting the growth and destroying both benign and malignant tumors. However treatments employed both in clinical trials or general practice have not demonstrated appreciable levels of tumor cell necrosis thus far.

One method for treating tumors brachytherapy involves injecting microscopic clumps of the protein albumin directly into the tumor. A suitable amount of radioactive phosphorous is then added through the same needle. The albumin clogs capillaries within the tumor thereby preventing the release of radioactive phosphorous to tissues outside the tumor. Tumor cells take up and use the phosphorous rapidly selectively killing them with radioactivity without damaging normal cells in other parts of the body. By the time the capillaries become unclogged all or most of the radioactive phosphorous has been absorbed by the cells comprising the tumor leaving little to escape into adjacent tissue. This therapy however is difficult to implement and always carries the danger of radioactive material escaping into healthy parts of the body causing serious damage.

Robert T. Gordon in U.S. Pat. No. 4 622 952 disclosed a different method for treating tumors. This method attempts to take advantage of the observed different heat sensitivity between tumor and normal cells. It is well known that tumor cells are killed at lower temperatures than normal cells. Thus Gordon proposed a method using electromagnetic energy to elevate the temperature of tumor cells or tissues to kill the tumor cells without seriously affecting normal cells.

Many attempts have been made to kill tumor cells with polyclonal or monoclonal isoantibodies or autologous antibodies elicited against tumor specific antigens. Generally this method is not successful especially when dealing with solid tumors.

Unfortunately these approaches for the prevention and or treatment of cancer have not been successful or completely satisfactory because of a number of problems such as the absence in the vaccine of tumor antigens expressed by the tumor to be treated poor characterization of the antigens in tumor vaccines the contamination of vaccines by immunogenic but undesirable material such as fetal calf serum FCS protein or transplantation antigens and additionally due to the antigenic heterogenicity of the cancer cells. Moreover such tumor vaccines were often prepared from fresh tumor cells the supply of which is limited so that the properties of the vaccines are not reproducible.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 658 234 issued to Dunlavy in 1997 describes a method for treating a tumor comprising the steps of selecting a target substance which has at least one component with an atomic or molecular resonance frequency or frequencies different from the atomic molecular or cellular resonant frequencies of normal cells locating or depositing the target substance within the tumor and irradiating the target substance with electromagnetic wave energy at a frequency or frequencies corresponding to the atomic or molecular resonance of the component such that the component absorbs energy from the electromagnetic wave resulting in the release of heat sufficient to destroy terminate or slow the growth of the tumor without adversely affecting the viability of normal cells.

Melanosomal antigens can be recognized by the immune system. This has been demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of a gp75 antigen from autologous melanoma cells by serum IgG antibodies of a patient with metastatic melanoma Mattes J. M. T. M. Thomson L. J. Old and K. O. Lloyd. 1983 A pigmentation associated differentiation antigen of human melanoma defined by a precipitating antibody in human serum Int. J. Cancer. 32 717 . The gp75 antigen is a melanosomal polypeptide that is the most abundant glycoprotein synthesized by pigmented melanocytes and melanomas. Tai T. M. Eisinger S. Ogata and K. O. Lloyd. 1983 Glycoproteins as differentiation markers in human malignant melanoma and melanocytes Cancer Res. 43 2773 . Epidermal melanocytes benign pigmented lesions and primary and metastatic melanomas express gp75 but other cell types do not Thomson T. M. F. X. Real S. Murakami C. Cardon Cardo L. J. Old and A. N. Houghton. 1988 Differentiation antigens of melanocytes and melanoma Analysis of melanosome and cell surface markers of human pigmented cells with monoclonal antibodies J. Invest. Dermatol. 90 459 . In the present invention it is demonstrated that gp75 cDNA had approximately 90 identity with the derived amino acid and nucleotide sequences of a mouse gene that maps to the b brown locus. The brown locus is a site that determines coat color and influences the type of melanin synthesized suggesting that gp75 may regulate or influence the type of melanin synthesized.

The fact that IgG antibodies in sera of a patient with metastatic melanoma have been shown to immunoprecipitate gp75 demonstrates that immunological tolerance against gp75 can be broken. This invention therefore provides expression vectors comprising gp75 cDNA for use as a vaccine against melanoma whereby the amino acid sequences of peptides were determined from gp75 polypeptide which was isolated and purified by the mouse monoclonal antibody TA99 and whereby cDNA clones were isolated by screening with oligonucleotides based on the peptide sequences.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 106 829 issued to He et al. uses a human prostatic specific reductase polypeptide as a diagnostic marker for prostate cancer and as an agent to determine if the prostate cancer has metastasized. The patent also discloses antibodies specific to the prostatic specific reductase polypeptide that may be used to target prostate cancer cells and be used as part of a prostate cancer vaccine.

Another method for treating tumors currently being evaluated by medical researchers makes use of a substance called telomerase an enzyme that tumor cells produce and require to remain alive but which normal body cells except for sperm and hematopoietic system neither produce nor require. This unique property of telomerase has prompted attempts to develop a drug that will block the action of the enzyme sufficiently to either inhibit the growth of new tumor cells or cause the death of older ones. Telomerase is an example of a class of substances that are often referred to as being tumor specific because they are needed and or used by tumor cells in differentially larger amounts than by normal healthy cells of the body.

Telomeres the protein DNA structures physically located on the ends of the eukaryotic organisms are required for chromosome stability and are involved in chromosomal organization within the nucleus See e.g. Zakian Science 270 1601 1995 Blackburn and Gall J. Mol. Biol. 120 33 1978 Oka et al. Gene 10 301 1980 and Klobutcher et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 78 3015 1981 . Telomeres are believed to be essential in such organisms as yeasts and probably most other eukaryotes as they allow cells to distinguish intact from broken chromosomes protect chromosomes from degradation and act as substrates for novel replication mechanisms. Telomeres are generally replicated in a complex cell cycle and developmentally regulated manner by telomerase a telomere specific DNA polymerase. However telomerase independent means for telomere maintenance have been described. In recent years much attention has been focused on telomeres as telomere loss has been associated with chromosomal changes such as those that occur in cancer and aging.

Importantly telomere replication is regulated both by developmental and cell cycle factors. It has been hypothesized that aspects of telomere replication may act as signals in the cell cycle. For example certain DNA structures of DNA protein complex formations may act as a checkpoint to indicate that chromosomal replication has been completed See e.g. Wellinger et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 13 4057 1993 . In addition it has been observed that in humans telomerase activity is not detectable in most somatic tissues although it is detected in many tumors Wellinger supra . This telomere length may serve as a mitotic clock which serves to limit the replication potential of cells in vivo and or in vitro. What remains needed in the art is a method 25 to study the role of telomeres and their replication in normal as well as abnormal cells i.e. cancerous cells . An understanding of telomerase and its function is needed in order to develop means for use of telomerase as a target for cancer therapy or anti aging processes.

Despite the wide ranging and expensive efforts expended in researching developing and evaluating new treatments and cures for tumors and cancers no truly significant advances or completely satisfactory treatments have thus far been achieved.

It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a novel and effective treatment modality for both benign and malignant tumors. The treatment must avoid the disadvantages and dangers of the prior treatments discussed above especially with respect to the use of radioactive substances and chemotherapy.

Another object of the present invention contemplates the ability to construct a vaccine that is universally effective against any proliferating tumor.

To achieve these objectives a most preferred embodiment of this invention is a universal vaccine for treating tumors of any origin having at least one telomerase reverse transcriptase hTRT peptide in an amount effective for initiating and enhancing a cytotoxic T lymphocyte CTL response against mammalian cancer cells in a physiologically acceptable carrier. Preferably the telomerase peptide is modified to enhance binding to a major histocompatibility complex MHC molecule.

The MHC molecule may advantageously be a Class I human leucocyte antigen HLA for example HLA A2. Preferably the hTRT peptide is a synthetic human telomerase reverse transcriptase peptide but it may also be an effective synthetic homologue. Preferably the peptide is from about 7 to about 15 amino acid residues in length and most preferably a 9mer. It may be effective either alone or in combination with other peptides.

The vaccine preparation described hereinabove may also comprise an adjuvant or facilitator. One highly preferred facilitator is an interleukin molecule. Also contemplated by this invention is a synthetic hTRT peptide advantageously restricted by a Class I major histocompatibility complex MHC molecule.

Another object of the invention is a method for inducing and enhancing a CTL response against cancer cells. This method comprises harvesting mammalian blood leucocytes pulsing the leucocytes with an effective amount of hTRT and contacting cancer cells with an effective amount of pulsed leucocytes. This contacting may be accomplished in vitro or in vivo. The method in its simplest form can be used in vitro for determining whether a cancer patient has potential immunity against his tumor and is a likely candidate for treatment.

Yet another object of this invention contemplates a method for targeting cytotoxic lymphocytes CTL to tumor cells by administering an effective amount of telomerase reverse transcriptase TRT peptide to a mammalian recipient which amount is effective to attract CTL to the tumor cells. The recipient preferably is a cancer patient.

These objects and other aspects and attributes of the present invention will become increasingly clear upon reference to the following drawings and accompanying specification.

As used herein the terms telomerase and telomerase complex refer to functional telomerase enzymes. It is intended that the terms encompass the complex of proteins found in telomerases. For example the terms encompass the 123 kDa and 43 kDa telomerase protein subunits.

Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme which has been linked to malignant transformation in human cells. Telomerase activity is increased in the vast majority of human tumors making its gene product the first molecule common to all human tumors. The generation of endogenously processed telomerase peptides bound to Class I major histocompatibility complex MHC molecules could therefore target cytotoxic T lymphocytes CTL to tumors of different origins. This could advance vaccine therapy against cancer provided that precursor CTL recognizing telomerase peptides in normal adults and cancer patients can be expanded through immunization. Applicant demonstrates here that the majority of normal individuals and patients with prostate cancer immunized in vitro against two HLA A2.1 restricted peptides from telomerase reverse transcriptase hTRT develop hTRT specific CTL. This suggests the existence of precursor CTL for hTRT in the repertoire of normal individuals and in cancer patients. Most importantly cancer patients CTL specifically lysed a variety of HLA A2 cancer cell lines demonstrating immunological recognition of endogenously processed hTRT peptides. Moreover in vivo immunization of HLA A2.1 transgenic mice generated a specific CTL response against both hTRT peptides. Based on the induction of CTL responses in vitro and in vivo and the susceptibility to lysis of tumor cells of various origins by hTRT CTL Applicant suggests that hTRT could serve as a universal cancer vaccine for humans.

Telomerase is a unique ribonucleoprotein that mediates RNA dependent synthesis of telomeric DNA 1 the distal ends of eukaryotic chromosomes that stabilize the chromosomes during replication 2 3 . When activated telomerase synthesizes telomeric DNA and compensates for its loss with each cell division 4 . Since telomeres shorten progressively with successive cell divisions telomere length is considered to mirror the replicative history of cell lineage 5 and cell population dynamics 6 7 . In mice telomerase appears to play an essential role in the long term viability of high renewal organ systems such as the reproductive and haemopoietic systems 8 .

Maintenance of a constant telomere length ensures chromosomal stability prevents cells from aging and confers immortality 9 11 . Mice lacking telomerase RNA show that telomerase activation is a key event in malignant cell transformation 8 12 13 . In humans in vitro studies show that the long term ectopic expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase hTRT in normal fibroblasts is sufficient for immortalization but not malignant transformation 14 . However the expression of hTRT in combination with two oncogenes SV40 T antigen and Ras promotes tumor transformation in normal human epithelial and fibroblast cell lines 15 . These transformed cells form tumors in nude mice. Thus although telomerase per se is not tumorigenic it plays a direct role in oncogenesis by allowing pre cancerous cells to proliferate continuously and become immortal. The PCR based TRAP assay 16 reveals a striking correlation 80 between high telomerase activity and tumors of different histological origins and types 17 18 . In contrast normal tissues display little or no telomerase activity 18 19 . Therefore telomerase expression in tumors is much greater than HER2 neu and mutated P53 which range between 30 and 50 respectively 20 21 . From the foregoing it is reasonable that expression of hTRT in cancer cells is a likely source of peptides that upon association with major histocompatibility complex MHC Class I molecules could target cytotoxic T lymphocytes CTL to cancer cells. An interesting analogy exists with HIV 1 reverse transcriptase an enzyme similar to hTRT which gives origin to peptide MHC Class I complexes that target CTL responses to virus infected cells 22 . Thus since high telomerase activity is widespread among human tumors hTRT could serve as a universal tumor antigen for immunotherapy and vaccine approaches.

hTRT is encoded in the genome and is in all respects a self antigen. Consequently CD8 T lymphocytes with a receptor for MHC hTRT peptide complexes are expected to be eliminated during thymic negative selection reducing the potential precursor T cell repertoire and imposing limitations on their expansion upon encounter with tumor cells in adult life. Additionally stimulation by antigen in the absence of a second signal induces clonal anergy 23 further hampering the potential repertoire. The extent to which these events affect the normal adult repertoire and whether or not exposure to hTRT during cancer formation has any adverse effect on the ability of cancer patients to respond is not known. Because answering these questions is relevant to future strategies of immune intervention targeted at hTRT the ability of normal individuals and cancer patients to mount a CTL response in vitro against two hTRT peptides restricted by the HLA A2 allele was analyzed.

hTRT synthetic peptides p540 540ILAKFLHWL548 SEQ ID NO 1 p865 865RLVDDFLLV873 SEQ ID NO 2 and MART 1 27AAGIGILTV35 SEQ ID NO 3 were purchased from the Biopolymer Synthesis Center CalTech Pasadena Calif. . Synthetic peptides 128TPPAYRPPNAPIL140 SEQ ID NO 4 of the hepatitis B core antigen HBVc 571YLSGANLNL579 SEQ ID NO 5 of carcinoembryonic antigen CEA 476VLYRYGSFSV486 SEQ ID NO 6 of melanoma antigen gp100 476ILKEPVHGV484 SEQ ID NO 7 of HIV 1 reverse transcriptase were purchased from Neosystem Strasburg France .

Buffy coats from normal donors were purchased from the San Diego Blood Bank. HLA A2 individuals were selected by FACS screening using monoclonal antibody BB7.2. Prostate cancer patients were recruited through the Division of Urology University of California San Diego . Blood from these patients was obtained by venipuncture. HLA A2 individuals were selected by FACS screening using monoclonal antibody BB7.2. Blood collection and experiments were performed in accordance with an approved IRB.

T2 cells were a kind gift of Dr. Peter Creswell Yale University . Melanoma cell lines 624 and 1351 were the kind gift of Dr. John Wunderlich National Cancer Institute Bethesda Md. . Prostate cancer cell lines LnCap and PC 3 were the kind gift from Dr. Antonella Vitiello PRI Johnson La Jolla Calif. . Breast colon and lung tumor cell lines were obtained from ATCC Rockville Md.

PBMC were separated by centrifugation on Ficoll Hypaque gradients and plated in 24 well plates at 5 10cells ml well in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 human AB serum L glutamine and antibiotics CM . Autologous PBMC stimulators were pulsed with hTRT synthetic peptides p540 or p865 10 g ml for 3 hours at 37 C. Cells were then irradiated at 5000 rads washed once and added to the responder cells at a responder stimulator ratio ranging between 1 1 and 1 4. The next day 12 IU ml IL 2 Chiron Co. Emeryville Calif. and 30 IU ml IL 7 R D Systems Minneapolis Minn. were added to the cultures. Lymphocytes were re stimulated weekly with peptide pulsed autologous adherent cells as follows. First autologous PBMC were incubated with hTRT peptide 10 g ml for 3 hours at 37 C. Non adherent cells were then removed by a gentle wash and the adherent cells were incubated with fresh medium containing the hTRT peptide 10 g m for an additional 3 hours at 37 C. Second responder cells from a previous stimulation cycle were harvested washed and added to the peptide pulsed adherent cells at a concentration of 5 10cells ml 2 ml well in medium without peptide. Recombinant IL 2 and IL 7 were added to the cultures on the next day.

HHD mice were immunized subcutaneously at the base of the tail with 100 g of individual hTRT peptide emulsified in incomplete Freunds adjuvant IFA . Half of the mice were immunized with the hTRT peptide and 140 g of the helper peptide TPPAYRPPNAPIL SEQ ID NO 4 which corresponds to residues 128 140 of the hepatitis B core antigen HBVc 25 .

The relative avidity was measured as previously described 25 . Briefly T2 cells were incubated overnight at 37 C. in RPMI supplemented with human 2 microglobulin 100 ng ml Sigma St. Louis Mo. in the absence negative control or presence of the test peptide or the reference peptide 476ILKEPVHGV484 SEQ ID NO 7 of HIV 1 reverse transcriptase at various final peptide concentrations 0.1 100 M . Cells were incubated with Brefeldin A 0.5 g ml for one hour and subsequently stained with a saturating concentration of monoclonal antibody BB7.2 for 30 minutes at 4 C. followed by washing and a second incubation with a goat antibody to mouse Ig Fab 2 conjugated to FITC Caltag South San Francisco . Cells were then washed fixed with 1 paraformaldehyde and analyzed in a FACs Calibur cytofluorimeter Becton Dickinson San Jose Calif. . The mean fluorescence intensity of each concentration minus that of cells without peptide was used as an estimate of peptide binding. Results are expressed as values of RA which is the ratio of the concentration of test peptide necessary to reach 20 of the maximal binding by the reference peptide over that of the reference peptide so that the lower the value the stronger the binding. Dissociation of the test peptide from the HLA A2.1 molecule reflects the half life of fluorescence intensity of the peptide MHC complex over time. The half life of the complex DC50 refers to the time hours required for a 50 reduction of the TO mean fluorescence intensity 25 . Synthetic peptides 571YLSGANLNL579 SEQ ID NO 5 of carcinoembryonic antigen CEA and 476VLYRYGSFSV486 SEQ ID NO 6 of melanoma antigen gp100 were used as internal controls to account for inter tests variability and for consistency with previously reported RA and DC50 measures 25 .

 a The induction of CTL in human PBMC was monitored in a conventional Cr release assay. Briefly peptide pulsed TAP HLA A2.1 human T2 cells were incubated with 10 g of hTRT peptides or with the MART 1 control peptide for 90 minutes during labeling with Cr. After washing the target cells were added to serially diluted effectors in 96 well microplates. After a 6 hour incubation period at 37 C. supernatants were harvested and counted in a Trilux Betaplate counter Wallac Turku Finland . Results are expressed as the percentage of specific lysis and determined as follows experimental cpm spontaneous cpm maximum cpm spontaneous cpm 100. b The induction of CTL in HHD mice was assessed as follows. Spleen cells were harvested 7 days after immunization and were restimulated in vitro with the corresponding hTRT peptide and LPS 25 g ml stimulated irradiated 5000 rads syngeneic spleen cells. After six days of culture the cells were harvested and tested for their ability to lyse HHD transfected TAP RMA cells in a 4 hour Cr release assay 25 . Specific lysis was calculated as indicated in the legend of . Values refer to maximal cytotoxicity measured for individual responder mice at an effector to target ratio of 60 1.

The amino acid sequence of hTRT locus AF015950 19 was analyzed for 9mer peptide sequences containing known binding motifs for the HLA A2.1 molecule 52 35 60 a subtype encompassing 95 of HLA A2 allele which is expressed in about 50 of the Caucasian population 26 28 . Peptides were identified by reverse genetics based on canonical anchor residues for HLA A2.1 29 and by using the software of the Bioinformatics Molecular Analysis Section NIH website bimas.dcrt.nih.gov molbio hla bind index.html which ranks 9mer peptides on a predicted half time dissociation coefficient from HLA Class I molecules 30 . From an initial panel of 30 candidate peptides Applicant retained two sequences 540ILAKFLHWL548 SEQ ID NO 1 and 865RLVDDFLLV873 SEQ ID NO 2 denoted hereunder as p540 and p865.

Since the immunogenicity of MHC Class I restricted peptides reflects to some degree their binding and stabilizing capacity for MHC Class I molecules 31 33 Applicant sought direct proof of the strength of interaction between the two hTRT peptides and the HLA A2.1 molecule in a conventional binding stabilization assay that uses the antigen transporting deficient TAP HLA A2.1 human T2 cells. The relative avidity RA calculated in reference to 476ILKEPVHGV484 SEQ ID NO 7 of HIV 1 reverse transcriptase a canonical high binder peptide 25 was 2.9 and 2.5 for p540 and p865 respectively Table I . The stability of each peptide bound to HLA A2.1 was measured as the half life of the complex

The presence of precursor T cells for both hTRT peptides and their expansion upon antigen stimulation were tested using peripheral blood lymphocytes PBMC of 10 HLA A2 normal blood donors in an in vitro immunization assay. Nine out of 10 individuals responded to immunization generating T cells that lysed peptide pulsed T2 cells as targets starting from the third round of peptide stimulation. All nine responders generated CTL specific for p540 and seven responded against p865 A and B . The values of maximal lysis varied from individual to individual and ranged between 28 68 and 20 68 respectively. In two instances donor 975 and 980 there was a lower but measurable non specific lysis possibly due to contaminant NK cells. Thus by random testing of normal HLA A2 individuals it was clearly established that both hTRT peptides are immunogenic implying that precursor CTL for hTRT are present in the peripheral adult repertoire.

Whether or not CTL against hTRT could also be induced in cancer patients was studied in four HLA A2.1 individuals with clinical and histological diagnosis of prostate cancer. All four patients were refractory to hormonal therapy three had metastases and none had prostatectomy. In prostate cancer the most common cause of cancer in men high hTRT expression has been documented in 84 of cases 34 . Marked lysis of peptide pulsed T2 cells was observed in 3 out of 4 individuals after three rounds of in vitro stimulation A and B . Both peptides yielded comparable CTL responses in all three individuals with maximal lysis ranging between 27 49 and 48 52 respectively. CTL against both peptides lysed LnCap a HLA A2.1 prostate cancer cell line with maximal lysis ranging between 24 36 for p540 and 12 40 for p865. Prostate cancer cell line PC 3 which is HLA A2.1 was used as control and was not lysed C . Both prostate cancer cell lines tested positive for hTRT by the TRAPeze telomerase detection assay INTERGEN not shown suggesting that the CTL generated against the synthetic peptides might lyse cancer cells by recognizing hTRTpeptide MHC Class I complex at the surface of cancer cells.

Cold target competition experiments were performed in an attempt to understand if lysis of the LnCap tumor cell line was specific for endogenously processed hTRT peptides. In these experiments the lysis of LnCap cells by CTL from a prostate cancer patient was competed for by T2 cells pulsed in vitro with p540 or p865 10 g ml . Peptide loaded T2 cells caused a dose dependent inhibition of lysis of LnCap cells in both peptide combinations A . Applicant further assessed the specificity of the CTL generated against each one of the two hTRT peptides by testing them on T2 targets pulsed with irrelevant HLA A2 binding peptides. Neither T2 cells pulsed with peptide 27AAGIGILTV35 SEQ ID NO 3 from the melanoma antigen MART 1 nor T2 cells pulsed with a non homologous hTRT peptide were lysed B . Collectively these studies show that 1 patients CTL are specific for the hTRT peptide used to induce them and 2 lysis of prostate cancer cells is mediated by and is specific for endogenously processed hTRT peptides complexed with HLA A2.1 molecules suggesting chemical identity between naturally processed peptides on tumor cells and the synthetic peptides used for immunization. Formal validation will require elution of peptides from tumor cells and their analysis by tandem mass spectrometry 35 . Studies on MHC restriction were performed using blocking antibodies. Lysis of peptide pulsed T2 cells by CTL lines generated from a prostate cancer patient was inhibited by the anti MHC Class I monoclonal antibody BB7.2 in both peptide combinations but not by the anti MHC Class II monoclonal antibody Q5 13 36 nor by transfectoma antibody 1RGD3 that blocks NK cells 37 . By two color FACS analysis the phenotype of T cells proliferating after three rounds of in vitro stimulation with hTRT peptide was CD3 78 CD8 37 CD4 36 and CD16 56 6 . Collectively these experiments confirm that effector T cells generated by in vitro immunization are MHC Class I restricted CD8 T cells which do not possess NK activity.

hTRT is expressed in normal cells such as circulating B and T cells germinal center B cells thymocytes and CD34 progenitor hemopoietic cells 6 7 38 . This implies that CTL generated against hTRT peptides could engender an autoimmune attack on normal cells. To this end Applicant verified whether cancer patients CTL would lyse HLA A2 CD34 cells. Neither CTL against p540 nor those against p865 induced any lysis over a wide range of effector to target E T ratios not shown . Thus at least with respect to hemopoietic stem cells an autoimmune attack appears unlikely. This is consistent with the fact that activated T cells were not lysed by hTRT CTL in culture.

Whether peptides can serve as immunogens in vivo and elicit a CTL response depends on a variety of factors such as the mode of immunization suitable activation of antigen presenting cells the frequency of precursor cells and binding and stabilization of MHC Class I molecules by peptide. In this study Applicant demonstrated Table I that both peptides bind to HLA A2.1 with a RA

Both p540 and p865 were able to induce specific CTL responses Table II although differences were noted. In fact p540 induced CTL whether alone or in combination with a helper peptide 66 vs. 80 responders . In contrast a high 70 response against p865 was obtained only when its immunogenicity was increased by association with the helper peptide. The different immunogenicity of the two hTRT peptides was also reflected by the magnitude of individual responses 55.8 9.4 vs. 20 11.5 lysis against p540 and p865 with helper peptide respectively. This is consistent with the observation that two normal blood donors responded to immunization against p540 but failed to respond against p865 . Thus there is an overall correlation between the results of binding stabilization of the HLA A2.1 molecule the results of immunogenicity in vitro of human PBMC and the response in vivo in HHD mice. Finally to exclude the development of untoward autoimmunity HHD mice immunized against hTRT peptides were monitored with respect to the number of circulating B lymphocytes. Using a dual stain B220 and anti Ig FACS analysis Applicant found no decrease in circulating B cells in immunized mice when compared to normal HHD mice not shown . Furthermore no enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes nor cellular infiltrates in the liver were noticed after immunization not shown .

Because CTL generated against p540 and p865 recognize naturally processed hTRT peptides on LnCap prostate cancer cells and hTRT activity is expressed at high levels in the

The antigen recognition activity of T cells is intimately linked with recognition of MHC HLA in humans molecules. This complex is located on chromosome 6 and encompasses nearly 200 genes encoding for MHC class I and class II among others. The initial discovery is in relation to the HLA A2 allele which is expressed in about 50 of the Caucasian population 56 . About 95 of HLA A2 white individuals express the HLA A2.1 subtype 53 .

The majority of peptides bound to MHC class I molecules have a restricted size of 9 1 amino acids and require free N and C terminal ends 52 59 61 . In addition to a specific size different class I molecules appear to require a specific combination of usually two main anchor residues within their peptide ligands 52 59 . In the case of the human allele HLA A2.1 these anchor residues have been described as leucine L at position 2 and L or valine V at the C terminal end 52 . More recently Ruppert et al. found that a canonical A2.1 motif could be defined as L or M methionine at position 2 and L V or I isoleucine at position 9 60 .

The peptide selection was confirmed using the application available online at the web site of the Bioinformatics Molecular Analysis Section of NIH bimas.dcrt.nih.gov molbio hla bind index.html that ranks potential 9mer peptides based on a predicted half time dissociation from HLA class I molecules deduced from 58 . In our pilot studies one of the peptides identified using the manual approach P865 ranked among the top HLA A2 binding peptides identified through the software guided analysis. Another peptide P540 ranked at the top in the software guided analysis.

Applicant used two such peptides 540ILAKFLHWL549 SEQ ID NO 1 and 865RLVDDFLLV873 SEQ ID NO 2 denoted as p540 and p865. Both peptides are able to induce a CTL response in vitro in normal blood donors and in patients with prostate cancer. Applicant has demonstrated that the same peptides are also able to induce a CTL response in vitro in patients with melanoma. A synopsis of these studies is shown in Table V.

Collectively it appears that p540 induced a CTL response in 3 out of 4 HLA A2 patients. P865 induced a response in two patients only. It should be noted that patient 00 was concomitantly being immunized with dendritic cells melanoma peptides peptides other than hTRT peptides and had a high background making it difficult to decided whether a specific response to hTRT had been induced.

Additional new findings came from exploring the immunogenicity of other hTRT peptides. In particular three peptides were tested whose sequence in the native hTRT molecules is shown below in Table VI 

Unlike p540 which was characterized as having a high affinity binding slow half time dissociation to HLA A2 Table VII these peptides have an estimated half time dissociation score faster than prototype p540.

Applicant then proceeded to add a single residue Y modification in position 1 which is supposed to increase the binding affinity to HLA A2 and also its immunogenicity 60 . The new modified sequences are shown in Table VI.

PBMC from three normal HLA A2 individuals were immunized with the Y modified peptides. The results are summarized as follows Table VII .

CTL generated against p572 were also able to lyze the hTRT HLA A2 melanoma cell line 624. The dose response curve of killing of melanoma 624 is shown in . The antigen recognition activity of T cells is intimately linked with recognition of MHC HLA in humans molecules.

Applicant has demonstrated that hTRT peptides can expand precursor CTL in PBMC of normal individuals and patients with prostate cancer and induce in both instances MHC Class I restricted peptide specific CTL responses.

Therefore the first major implication from these findings is that the available CTL repertoire for hTRT is similarly preserved not only in normal individuals as recently reported 24 but also and more importantly in individuals with cancer. This suggests that exposure to cancer does not cause deletion or anergy of clonotypes specific for hTRT. Since the three patients responding to immunization were resistant to hormone therapy and had metastases it was surprising that hTRT CTL could be induced at such an advanced stage of disease generally characterized by immunosuppression. Based on these considerations one could predict that since the frequency of precursors from PBMC is high enough to permit their expansion in vitro and because hTRT peptides bind to MHC Class I with sufficient avidity the two peptides identified in this study may be used for vaccination of HLA A2 cancer patients.

The finding that prostate cancer patients CTL mediate efficient lysis of a variety of HLA A2 cancer cells such as prostate breast colon lung and melanoma is unprecedented. Based on the values of specific lysis it appears as if these cancer cells are equally effective in processing and presenting the same endogenous hTRT peptides. Therefore a second major implication of our study is that similar hTRT peptides are expressed and complexed with MHC Class I molecules on a variety of cancer cells of different histological origins and types. This renders them susceptible to destruction by CTL and underscores the potential advantage hTRT immunization may have in the control of primary tumors and metastases in a large variety of cancer types in humans.

The future of hTRT based vaccination will also depend on the type of side effects that may follow immunization. Since hTRT is expressed in stem cells and mature hemopoietic cells 6 7 38 the possibility exists that hTRT vaccination could result in autoimmunity and destruction of normal cells. In our hands cancer patients CTL specific for either p540 or p865 failed to lyse HLA A2 CD34 cells. Similarly CTL against p540 raised in normal individuals did not lyse HLA A2 CD34 cells 24 . Together with the lack of overt autoimmune defects in hemopoietic cells and in the liver in HHD mice following vaccination with hTRT peptides Applicant provisionally concludes that CTL specific for hTRT are unlikely to trigger autoimmunity against normal cells. Possibly the quantity of hTRT peptides generated under physiological lineage clonotype activation and differentiation is insufficient to mediate lysis by CTL. Whether the same holds true for germ cells of reproductive organs for which little is known about CD8 T cell mediated autoimmunity can only be speculated. While additional experiments are needed the fact that autoimmunity does not develop after immunization against tumor antigens shared by normal tissues 48 49 including the lymphoid tissue 50 and reproductive organs 51 supports the view that hTRT based vaccination in cancer patients may be possible and safe.

Methods to implement such hTRT based vaccination will include the variety of methods currently in use such as synthetic peptides synthetic peptides in immunological adjuvant dendritic cells pulsed with synthetic peptides naked DNA and RNA. In addition Applicant anticipates that effective vaccination can be achieved using transgenic cells. For instance genes under a specific lymphocyte promoter can be engineered to code for desired hTRT peptides transfected and expressed in lymphocytes from an individual e.g. a cancer patient and the patient s own lymphocytes can be used for vaccination since lymphocytes process and present peptides to T lymphocytes hence effecting vaccination.

In conclusion based on the demonstration that precursor CTL specific for two hTRT peptides can be expanded in patients with cancer their CTL recognize the same hTRT peptides on tumor cells of various origins and histological types and a strong in vivo CTL response against both hTRT peptides was induced in HLA A2.1 monochain transgenic mice Applicant suggests that hTRT can be regarded as a universal cancer antigen and its peptides as the substrate for a possible universal cancer vaccine for humans.
