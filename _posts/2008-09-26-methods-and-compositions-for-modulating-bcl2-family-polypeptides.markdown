This application is the National Phase Application of PCT US2008011500 WO2009 042237 filed on Sep. 26 2008 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 60 995 545 filed on Sep. 26 2007 and 61 124 221 filed on Apr. 14 2008. The entire teachings of the above applications are incorporated herein by reference.

BCL 2 family protein interactions regulate apoptosis an orchestrated set of events designed to rid the body of damaged or unwanted cells and a process critical for normal development and organism homeostasis Adams J. M. and Cory S. 1998 Science 281 1322 1326 Danial N. N. and Korsmeyer S. J. 2004 Cell 116 205 219 . Whereas multidomain anti apoptotic proteins such as BCL 2 guard against cell death multidomain pro apoptotic proteins such as BAX constitute a gateway to cell death through mitochondrial damage. Multidomain apoptotic proteins display sequence conservation in up to four BCL 2 homology BH domains yet the BH3 only subset of pro apoptotic proteins displays homology only to the third BH domain. The BH3 only proteins function as death sentinels situated throughout the cell poised to transmit signals of cell injury to multidomain members. Depending on the nature of apoptotic stimuli and cellular context the BH3 only protein s death signal will either be neutralized by anti apoptotic proteins or delivered directly or indirectly to the mitochondrial executioners BAX and BAK. When activated these pro apoptotic multidomain members induce permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane enabling released mitochondrial factors to activate caspases which irreversibly execute the death program Green D. R. 2005 . Cell 121 671 674 .

Structural studies have demonstrated the insertion of BH3 ligands into the hydrophobic groove formed by the juxtaposition of BH1 BH2 and BH3 domains of anti apoptotic multidomain members Day C. L. et al. 2005 J Biol Chem 280 4738 4744 Denisov A. Y. 2003 J Biol Chem 278 21124 21128 Liu X. et al. 2003 Immunity 19 341 352 . Recent work has uncovered the binding specificities of BH3 only members for their anti apoptotic partners and the structural basis for these selectivities Certo M. Moore et. Al. 2006 Cancer Cell 9 351 365. Chen L. et al. 2005 Mol Cell 17 393 403 . BH3 only proteins antagonize anti apoptotic proteins through these direct interactions and thereby decreases anti apoptotic inhibition of BAX BAK and or competitively displace bound BH3 only members that are capable of direct activation of BAX BAK. BH3 only proteins that exclusively engage anti apoptotic proteins to exert their pro apoptotic activity e.g. BAD have thus been termed sensitizers Letai A. et al. 2002 Cancer Cell 2 183 192 or derepressors Kuwana T. et al. 2005 1 Mol Cell 17 525 535 . Recent yeast two hybrid immunoprecipitation and biochemical studies support a role for select BH3 only members including BID and BIM in direct activation of BAX. Carton P. F. et al. 16 807 818 2004 Harada H. et al. 101 15313 15317 2004 Marani M. et al. 22 3577 3589 2002 Walensky L. D. et al. 24 199 210 2006 Wang K. et al. 10 2859 2869. 1996 . However the inability to measure a direct binding affinity between the BH3 domain of these activator BH3 only proteins and native BAX protein and the requirement of up to 50 micromolar dosing of activating BH3 peptides to trigger BAX activation in vitro Kuwana T. et al. 2005 . Mol Cell 17 525 535 Kuwana T. et al. 2002 . Cell 111 331 342 have led to uncertainty about the existence of a BH3 mediated direct BAX BAK activation pathway. In fact the lack of binding and structural data to support such interactions has led to the hypothesis that the pro apoptotic potency of presumed activator peptides such as BIM BH3 may instead reflect their ability to effectively neutralize all anti apoptotic proteins tested to date.

As used herein a hyperproliferative disorder means cancer neoplastic growth hyperplastic or proliferative growth or a pathological state of abnormal cellular development or survival and includes solid tumors non solid tumors and any abnormal cellular proliferation or accumulation such as that seen in leukemia.

The terms anticancer agent and anticancer drug as used herein refer to any therapeutic agents e.g. chemotherapeutic compounds and or molecular therapeutic compounds antisense therapies nucleic acid therapies e.g. RNAi radiation therapies used in the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases such as cancer. In one embodiment the invention is directed to methods of treating a BCL 2 associated disorder comprising administering an effective dose of an anticancer agent and a compound which binds to the active site as described herein of a BCL 2 family peptide.

As used herein the term structural coordinates refers to Cartesian coordinates corresponding to an atom s spatial relationship to other atoms in a molecule or molecular complex. Structural coordinates may be obtained using x ray crystallography techniques or NMR techniques or may be derived using molecular replacement analysis or homology modeling. Various software programs allow for the graphical representation of a set of structural coordinates to obtain a three dimensional representation of a molecule or molecular complex. Structural coordinates for the BCL 2 family members are known in the art and publicly available.

The term interaction template refers to a three dimensional model built using Cartesian coordinates corresponding to an atom s spatial relationship to other atoms in a molecule or molecular complex. Structural coordinates may be obtained using x ray crystallography techniques or NMR techniques or may be derived using molecular replacement analysis or homology modeling. Various software programs allow for the graphical representation of a set of structural coordinates to obtain a three dimensional representation of a molecule or molecular complex. The structural coordinates of BCL 2 family polypeptides are known in the art and can be found for example at Protein Data Bank PDB Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics http www.rcsb.org . For example known BCL 2 family structural co ordinates include BAX PDB ID No. 1f16 BAK PDB ID No. 2ims BCL 2 PDB ID No. 1g5m BIM PDB ID No. 2pqk and BCL XL PDB ID No. 11x1 in addition to those associated with this invention BIM BH3 BAX PDB ID No. 2k7w as well as others known in the art.

Preferably the interaction template is of a BAX polypeptide having the amino acids sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO 1 wherein the active site of the BAX polypeptide is accessible to solvent and available for interaction with modulators e.g. activators. This three dimensional form of BAX is used to facilitate the identification of compounds which bind in the active site. As used herein the interaction template includes templates created by comparing the sequence structual alignment of BAX to other BCL 2 family polypeptides. Identification of conserved and non conserved residues allows a skilled artisan to identify a corresponding active site in other BCL 2 family polypeptides and design screen modulators of the polypeptide.

As used herein in relation to the position of an amino acid e.g. Ala 149 of SEQ ID NO 1 the term corresponding to refers to an amino acid in a first polypeptide sequence e.g. BAX that aligns with a given amino acid in a reference polypeptide sequence e.g. BAK when the first polypeptide and reference polypeptide sequences are aligned by homology or other algorithms e.g. structural comparison . For example Leu 92 of SEQ ID NO 2 corresponds to Leu 90 of SEQ ID NO 6 and Leu 141 of SEQ ID NO 7. Similarly Gly 96 of SEQ ID NO 2 corresponds to Gly 94 of SEQ ID NO 6 and Ala 145 of SEQ ID NO 7. Alignment is performed by one of skill in the art using software designed for this purpose for example BLASTP version 2.2.2 with the default parameters for that version. Corresponding amino acids can also be identified upon structural comparisons of a first polypeptide sequence and a second polypeptide sequence. Such structural comparisons are known in the art and described herein. For example Petros et al. Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1644 83 94 2004 and Suzuki et al. Cell. 103 645 654 2000 illustrated structural alignments between BCL 2 homology domains of BCL 2 family members.

The term amino acid refers to a molecule containing both an amino group and a carboxyl group. Suitable amino acids include without limitation both the D and L isomers of the 20 common naturally occurring amino acids found in peptides e.g. A R N C D Q E G H I L K M F P S T W Y V as known by the one letter abbreviations as well as the naturally occurring and unnaturally occurring amino acids prepared by organic synthesis or other metabolic routes.

A non essential amino acid residue is a residue that can be altered from the wild type sequence of a polypeptide e.g. BIM BH3 without abolishing or substantially altering its BAX binding ability. An essential amino acid residue is a residue that when altered from the wild type sequence of the polypeptide results in abolishing or substantially abolishing the polypeptide s binding activity to a BAX active site. The essential and non essential amino acid residues of the BH3 domains can readily be determined by methods well known in the art and described herein. The term essential amino acid residue as used herein includes conservative substitutions of the essential amino acid. Generally the essential amino acid residues are found at the interacting face residues interacting with BAX of the BH3 polypeptide.

A conservative amino acid substitution is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. For example families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains e.g. lysine arginine histidine acidic side chains e.g. aspartic acid glutamic acid uncharged polar side chains e.g. glycine asparagine glutamine serine threonine tyrosine cysteine nonpolar side chains e.g. alanine valine leucine isoleucine proline phenylalanine methionine tryptophan beta branched side chains e.g. threonine valine isoleucine and aromatic side chains e.g. tyrosine phenylalanine tryptophan histidine . Other conserved amino acid substitutions can also occur across amino acid side chain families such as when substituting an asparagine for aspartic acid in order to modify the charge of a peptide. Thus a predicted nonessential amino acid residue in a BH3 domain polypeptide for example is preferably replaced with another amino acid residue from the same side chain family or homologues across families e.g. asparagines for aspartic acid glutamine for glutamic acid . In addition individual substitutions deletions or additions that alter add or delete a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino acids in an encoded sequence are also considered conservative substitutions.

The terms identical or percent identity in the context of two or more nucleic acids or polypeptide sequences refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same or have a specified percentage of nucleotides or amino acids that are the same when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence as measured using one of the following sequence comparison algorithms or by visual inspection.

 Similarity or percent similarity in the context of two or more polypeptide sequences refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same or have a specified percentage of amino acid residues or conservative substitutions thereof that are the same when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence as measured using one of the following sequence comparison algorithms or by visual inspection. By way of example a first protein region can be considered similar to a region of an anti apoptotic BCL 2 family member protein when the amino acid sequence of the first region is at least 40 50 60 70 75 80 90 or even 95 identical or conservatively substituted to a region of the second anti apoptotic BCL 2 family member protein when compared to any sequence of an equal number of amino acids as the number contained in the first region or when compared to an alignment of anti apoptotic BCL 2 family member proteins that has been aligned by a computer similarity program known in the art as discussed below. Preferably the polypeptide region of the first protein and the second protein includes one or more conserved amino acid residues e.g. such as those illustrated in .

The present invention is directed to methods kits and compositions for modulating the activity of BCL 2 family polypeptides e.g. BAX by targeting a new regulatory site on BCL 2 family proteins. The methods and compounds of the invention are useful for treating and or preventing disorders e.g. hyperpoliferative disorders characterized by the deregulation of one or more polypeptides of the BCL 2 family. Further the methods and compounds of the present invention are also useful in the treatment of non BCL 2 related disorder associated with excessive cellular proliferation or survival or excessive cellular death e.g. apoptosis . The present invention is based at least in part on the identification of an active site on a BAX polypeptide which when bound by a compound modifies the apoptotic activity of the BAX polypeptide. At least in part the identity and location of this active site was revealed by the specific binding activity of hydrocarbon stapled activator BH3 peptides to the active site. Whereas blockade of this active site represses BAX induced cell death ligand engagement triggers BAX mediated apoptosis.

For example the method includes incubating a target polypeptide with a BH3 SAHB polypeptide comprising a covalent crosslinkable moiety crosslinking the BH3 SAHB polypeptide to the target polypeptide and identifying the intercalation site of the BH3 SAHB polypeptide to the target polypeptide.

In one embodiment the crosslinkable moiety is a benzophenone. Suitable BH3 SAHB polypeptides include BIM BID PUMA and BAX. The amino acid sequence and benzophenone location for numerous BH3 SAHB polypeptides is represented in .

In still another aspect the invention is directed to kits containing any of the above compounds and instructions for use.

The BCL 2 family of proteins includes both pro and anti apoptotic polypeptides that provide the checks and balances that govern susceptibility to cell death . Deregulation of this pathway has been documented in the pathogenesis of a wide spectrum of human diseases including many cancers.

Members of the evolutionarily conserved BCL 2 family are important regulators of apoptotic cell death and survival. The proteins BCL 2 Bcl xL Bcl w Bfl1 A1 Bcl B and Mcl 1 are death antagonists while Bax Bak Bad Bcl xs Bid Bim and Bik are death agonists Kroemer et al. Nature Med. 6 614 20 1997 .

The BCL 2 family is defined by the presence of up to four conserved BCL 2 homology BH domains designated BH1 BH2 BH3 and BH4 all of which include alpha helical segments Chittenden et al. 1995 EMBO 14 5589 Wang et al. 1996 Genes Dev. 10 2859 . Anti apoptotic proteins such as BCL 2 and BCL XL display sequence conservation in all BH domains. Pro apoptotic proteins are divided into multidomain members e.g. BAK BAX BOK which possess homology in the BH1 BH2 and BH3 domains and the BH3 domain only members e.g. BID BAD BIM BIK NOXA PUMA that contain sequence homology exclusively in the BH3 amphipathic alpha helical segment. BCL 2 family members have the capacity to form homo and heterodimers suggesting that competitive binding and the ratio between pro and anti apoptotic protein levels dictates susceptibility to death stimuli. Anti apoptotic proteins function to protect cells from pro apoptotic excess i.e. excessive programmed cell death. In certain cell types death signals received at the plasma membrane trigger apoptosis via a mitochondrial pathway. The mitochondria can serve as a gatekeeper of cell death by sequestering cytochrome c a critical component of a cytosolic complex which activates caspase 9 leading to fatal downstream proteolytic events. Multidomain proteins such as BCL 2 BCL XL and BAK BAX play dueling roles of guardian and executioner at the mitochondrial membrane with their activities further regulated by upstream BH3 only members of the BCL 2 family. For example BID is a member of the BH3 domain only subset of pro apoptotic proteins and transmits death signals received at the plasma membrane to effector pro apoptotic proteins at the mitochondrial membrane. Select BH3 only members such as BID and BIM have been termed activators Letai A. et al. 2 183 192 2002 and have the unique capability of interacting with both pro and anti apoptotic proteins Walensky Mol Cell 2006 . Upon caspase 8 activation BID is cleaved and the truncated adduct tBID triggers cytochrome c release and mitochondrial apoptosis through engagement of BCL 2 family proteins.

Deletion and mutagenesis studies determined that the amphipathic alpha helical BH3 segment of pro apoptotic family members functions as a death domain and thus represents a critical structural motif for interacting with multidomain apoptotic proteins. Structural studies have demonstrated that the BH3 helix interacts with anti apoptotic proteins by inserting into a hydrophobic groove formed by the interface of BH1 2 and 3 domains. tBID and BIM can be bound and sequestered by anti apoptotic proteins e.g. BCL 2 and BCL X and can trigger activation of the pro apoptotic proteins BAX and BAK leading to cytochrome c release and a mitochondrial apoptosis program.

BCL 2 related ovarian killer BOK is the third member of the pro apoptotic multidomain subgroup and is also bound by activator SAHB ligands such as BID and BIM SAHBs. BOK was cloned from an ovarian cDNA library and found to be highly expressed in ovary uterus and testis. BOK mRNA species have since been identified in a broader distribution of tissues including heart spleen liver colon lung intestine thyroid gland adrenal pancreas and bone marrow and select cancer cell lines.

The first X ray and NMR structure of a BCL 2 family protein BCL X was reported in 1996. BCL Xconsists of eight alpha helices two of which form a central hydrophobic core similar to the membrane insertion domains of pore forming Diphtheria toxin and colicins. This structural analogy led to experimental confirmation that BCL 2 family members can mediate pore formation in liposomal and mitochondrial systems an activity that is dependent upon core helices 5 and 6.

On the pro apoptotic side NMR structures of BH3 only BID and multidomain pro apoptotic BAX disclosed similarities between the proponents and opponents of cell death . BID and BAX likewise possess two central core helices that are surrounded by 6 or 7 amphipathic helices respectively. The amino terminal portions of BID and BAX contain unstructured loops as do select anti apoptotic proteins such as BCL 2 and BCL X.

The structures of many of the BCL 2 family polypeptides including BCL X BCL 2 BID BAX BCL w MCL 1 BAX are known in the art and readily accessible. For example BCL 2 family polypeptides can be obtained from the Protein Data Bank PDB Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics http www.rcsb.org . For example known BCL 2 family structural co ordinates include BAX PDB ID No. 1f16 BAK PDB ID No. 2ims BCL 2 PDB ID No. 1g5m BCL XL PDB ID No. 11x1 in addition to that associated with this invention BIM BH3 BAX PDB ID No. 2k7w as well as others known in the art.

The present invention is based at least in part on the discovery that hydrocarbon stapled and thus structurally reinforced activator BH3 polypeptides such as BIM SAHB bind a novel active site on BAX polypeptides that results in activation of the pro apoptotic activity of BAX. The present studies have provided structural information that has enabled identification of the region of the BAX polypeptide involved in the molecular interaction with BIM SAHB and thus activation of this polypeptide thereby providing methods for identifying other specific modulators of BAX and any other BCL 2 family polypeptides or other class of polypeptides containing a corresponding active site.

NMR structural analysis of BIM BH3 SAHB co complexed with BAX revealed an active site of BAX which is formed by the juxtaposition of BAX alpha helices 1 and 6 . The NMR data of the complexed BAX polypeptide with BIM SAHB shows the active site is comprised of both a hydrophobic patch and a perimeter of charged and hydrophilic residues which contribute to the binding of BIM BH3 and activation of BAX. The hydrophobic patch is comprised of but not limited to amino acid residues Ala 24 Met 20 Leu 25 Leu 27 Ile 31 Ile 133 Met 137 Gly 138 Trp 139 Leu 141 while the charged and hydrophilic regions are comprised of but not limited to Lys 21 Gln 28 Gln 32 Asp 33 Gln 52 Glu 17 Arg 134 Thr 135 Asp 142 Arg 145 Arg 147 of SEQ ID NO 1. These hydrophobic amino acids in turn bind hydrophobic amino acid residues Ile 148 Ala 149 Leu 152 Ile 155 Gly 156 and Phe 159 of BIM SAHB and the charged and hydrophilic amino acid residues bind charged and hydrophilic amino acid residues Arg 153 Arg 154 Asp 157 Glu 158 Asn 160 and Tyr 163 of BIM SAHB.

The polypeptides of the present invention may have stabilized e.g. cross linked alpha helical domains. Preferable the polypeptides are hydrocarbon stapled. Hydrocarbon stapling is described in U.S. Publication No. 2005 0250680 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

As used herein the term hydrocarbon stapling refers to a process for stably cross linking a polypeptide having at least two modified amino acids that helps to conformationally bestow the native secondary structure of that polypeptide. Hydrocarbon stapling allows a polypeptide predisposed to have an alpha helical secondary structure to maintain its native alpha helical conformation. This secondary structure increases resistance of the polypeptide to proteolytic cleavage and heat and also may increase hydrophobicity. Accordingly the hydrocarbon stapled cross linked polypeptides described herein e.g. BH3 SAHB have improved biological activity relative to a corresponding non hydrocarbon stapled uncrosslinked polypeptide. For example the cross linked polypeptide can include an alpha helical domain of a BIM BH3 polypeptide which can interact with a BAX active site.

The hydrocarbon stapled polypeptides include one or more tethers linkages between two non natural amino acids which tether significantly enhances the alpha helical secondary structure of the polypeptide. Generally the tether extends across the length of one or two helical turns i.e. about 3.4 or about 7 amino acids . Accordingly amino acids positioned at i and i 3 i and i 4 or i and i 7 are ideal candidates for chemical modification and cross linking. Thus for example where a peptide has the sequence . . . X1 X2 X3 X4 X5 X6 X7 X8 X9 . . . cross links between X1 and X4 or between X1 and X5 or between X1 and X8 are useful as are cross links between Xa2 and X5 or between X2 and X6 or between X2 and X9 etc. The use of multiple cross links e.g. 2 3 4 or more is also contemplated. The use of multiple cross links is very effective at stabilizing and optimizing the peptide especially with increasing peptide length. Thus the invention encompasses the incorporation of more than one crosslink within the polypeptide sequence to either further stabilize the sequence or facilitate the structural stabilization proteolytic resistance acid stability thermal stability and biological activity enhancement of longer polypeptide stretches. The process of hydrocarbon stapling is fully described in U.S. Patent Publication No. US2005 0250680 filed Nov. 5 2004 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The tether can include an alkyl alkenyl or alkynyl moiety e.g. C Cor Calkyl or a C Cor Calkenyl or C Cor Calkynyl . The tethered amino acid can be alpha disubstituted e.g. C Cor methyl .

In certain embodiments the two alpha alpha disubstituted stereocenters are both in the R configuration or S configuration e.g. i i 4 cross link or one stereocenter is R and the other is S e.g. i i 7 cross link . Thus where formula I is depicted as

In some embodiments the SAHB polypeptide comprises at least 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 45 50 or more contiguous amino acids of a BH3 domain. Each Xaa y is a peptide that can independently comprise at least 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 25 or more contiguous amino acids of a BH3 domain. Xaa is a peptide that can comprise 3 or 6 contiguous amino acids of acids of a BH3 domain.

The SAHB polypeptide can comprise 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 contiguous amino acids of acids of a BH3 domain wherein two amino acids that are separated by two three or six amino acids are replaced by amino acid substitutes that are linked via R. Thus at least two amino acids can be replaced by tethered amino acids or tethered amino acid substitutes. Thus where formula I is depicted as

 Xaa and Xaa can each comprise contiguous polypeptide sequences from the same or different BH3 domains.

The invention features cross linked polypeptides comprising 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 30 35 40 45 50 or more contiguous amino acids of a BH3 domain wherein the alpha carbons of two amino acids that are separated by two three or six amino acids are linked via R one of the two alpha carbons is substituted by Rand the other is substituted by Rand each is linked via peptide bonds to additional amino acids.

The modified polypeptide forms an alpha helix and can have an amino acid sequence which is 30 or more identical to an amino acid sequence disclosed herein.

The polypeptide forms and alpha helix and includes an amino acid sequence which is about 30 or more identical to an amino acid sequence described herein.

While hydrocarbon tethers have been described other tethers are also envisioned. For example the tether can include one or more of an ether thioether ester amine or amide moiety. In some cases a naturally occurring amino acid side chain can be incorporated into the tether. For example a tether can be coupled with a functional group such as the hydroxyl in serine the thiol in cysteine the primary amine in lysine the acid in aspartate or glutamate or the amide in asparagine or glutamine. Accordingly it is possible to create a tether using naturally occurring amino acids rather than using a tether that is made by coupling two non naturally occurring amino acids. It is also possible to use a single non naturally occurring amino acid together with a naturally occurring amino acid.

It is further envisioned that the length of the tether can be varied. For instance a shorter length of tether can be used where it is desirable to provide a relatively high degree of constraint on the secondary alpha helical structure whereas in some instances it is desirable to provide less constraint on the secondary alpha helical structure and thus a longer tether may be desired.

Additionally while examples of tethers spanning from amino acids i to i 3 i to i 4 and i to i 7 have been described in order to provide a tether that is primarily on a single face of the alpha helix the tethers can be synthesized to span any combinations of numbers of amino acids and also used in combination to install multiple tethers.

As can be appreciated by the skilled artisan methods of synthesizing the compounds of the described herein will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art. Additionally the various synthetic steps may be performed in an alternate sequence or order to give the desired compounds. Synthetic chemistry transformations and protecting group methodologies protection and deprotection useful in synthesizing the compounds described herein are known in the art and include for example those such as described in R. Larock Comprehensive Organic Transformations VCH Publishers 1989 T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis 2d. Ed. John Wiley and Sons 1991 L. Fieser and M.

Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis John Wiley and Sons 1995 and subsequent editions thereof.

Identification of this active site aids the development and identification of compounds which are capable of modulating BAX and other BCL 2 family polypeptides having a corresponding active site. For example using this information a three dimensional computer generated interaction template of BAX can be generated by one of ordinary skill in the art and used to design activators and inhibitors specific for the BAX active site. In another embodiment one of ordinary skill in the art can apply the BAX active site to identify corresponding active sites in other BCL 2 family members. This information may then be used to identify develop compounds capable of modulating the other BCL 2 family polypeptides.

Determination of the three dimensional structure of the BCL 2 polypeptide and specifically the active site is critical to the rational identification and or design of agents that may act as modulators of BCL 2 family polypeptide activity. This is advantageous over conventional drug assay techniques in which the only way to identify such an agent is to screen thousands of test compounds until an agent having the desired inhibitory effect on a target compound is identified. Necessarily such conventional screening methods are expensive time consuming and do not elucidate the method of action of the identified agent on the target compound. Using such a three dimensional structure researchers identify putative binding sites and then identify or design agents to interact with these binding sites. These agents are then screened for a modulating effect upon the target molecule. In this manner not only are the number of agents to be screened for the desired activity greatly reduced but the mechanism of action on the target compound is better understood.

It is contemplated that identification of the BAX active site can be used to computationally screen small molecule databases for compounds that can bind in whole or in part to one or more of the regions of the BCL 2 family polypeptide s active site. In one embodiment of this method the quality or fit of the compound identified to the regions of the active site can be judged either by shape complementarity or by estimated interaction energy Meng et al. J. Comp. Chem. 13 505 524 1992 .

In a further embodiment potential modulators that can be analyzed according to the methods of the invention can be obtained using any of the numerous approaches in combinatorial library methods known in the art. In one embodiment potential modulators are first identified for pro apoptotic or anti apoptotic activity using the in vitro assays described herein or known in the art. Once potential modulators are identified and their structures determined further optimization can be carried out by computational analyses using the structure information of the BAX active site described herein. In another embodiment a potential modulator is first identified in a screen using an interaction template developed from the structure coordinates of the BCL 2 family active site and further subjected to optimization by additional computational analyses. Alternatively further optimization can be carried out by determining the NMR structural coordinates of co complexes of the potential modulator and the BCL 2 family active site using the methods described herein.

Various combinatorial libraries that can be used in the methods of the invention include but are not limited to biological libraries spatially addressable parallel solid phase or solution phase libraries synthetic library methods requiring deconvolution the one bead one compound library method and synthetic library methods using affinity chromatography selection. The biological library approach is limited to peptide libraries while the other four approaches are applicable to peptide non peptide oligomer or small molecule libraries of compounds Lam 1997 Anticancer Drug Des. 12 145 .

In a preferred embodiment the library of compounds is a digital library. The binding interaction is performed with a database searching program which is capable of scanning a database of small molecules of known three dimensional structure for candidates which fit into the active site.

The potential modulator effect of a compound can be further analyzed prior to its actual synthesis and testing by use of computer modeling techniques using the structural coordinates of the BAX active site. If the computer modeling indicates an interaction the molecule can then be synthesized using standard methods known to those skilled in the chemical arts and then tested for its ability to modulate the activity of a BCL 2 family polypeptide using the assays set forth herein.

A modulator or other binding compound of a BCL 2 family polypeptide may be computationally evaluated and designed by means of a series of steps in which chemical entities or fragments are screened and selected for their ability to associate with the individual active site. In other embodiments of the method of the invention potential modulator compounds can be examined for their ability to associate with a BCL 2 family polypeptide s active site and more particularly with a BAX active site. This process can involve visual inspection of for example the active site on a computer screen based on the structural coordinates of the BAX active site. Selected compounds or chemical moieties can then be positioned in a variety of orientations or docked within an individual region of the active site as defined herein. Docking can be accomplished using software such as Quanta and SYBYL followed by energy minimization and molecular dynamics with standard molecular mechanics forcefields such as CHARMM and AMBER.

In some embodiments the invention involves the inputting of structural coordinates of BCL 2 family polypeptides into an electronic storage medium to generate a three dimensional computer model of the polypeptide. In one embodiment the complete structural coordinates of a BCL 2 family polypeptide are input. In an alternative embodiment a fragment or less than the complete structural coordinates but including the active site are inputted. The structural coordinates may be known in the art or based on homology modeling. For example known BCL 2 family structural coordinates include BAX PDB ID No. 1fl 6 BAK PDB ID No. 2ims BCL 2 PDB ID No. 1g5m and BCL XL PDB ID No. 11x1 in addition to those associated with this invention BIM BH3 BAX PDB ID No. 2k7w as well as others known in the art. Structural coordinates for many known BCL 2 family polypeptides can be obtained from the Protein Data Bank PDB Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics http www.rcsb.org .

The present invention further provides that the structural coordinates of the present invention may be used with standard homology modeling techniques in order to determine the unknown three dimensional structure of a molecule or molecular complex. Homology modeling involves constructing a model of an unknown structure using structural coordinates of one or more related protein molecules molecular complexes or parts thereof i.e. active sites . Homology modeling may be conducted by fitting common or homologous portions of the protein whose three dimensional structure is to be solved to the three dimensional structure of homologous structural elements in the known molecule specifically using the relevant i.e. homologous structural coordinates. Homology may be determined using amino acid sequence identity homologous secondary structure elements and or homologous tertiary folds. Homology modeling can include rebuilding part or all of a three dimensional structure with replacement of amino acid residues or other components by those of the related structure to be solved.

Once an interaction template is prepared compounds which bind the BCL 2 family polypeptide s active site can be identified. Specialized computer programs that can also be used in the process of selecting compounds or chemical entities include 

Once suitable compounds or chemical moieties have been selected they can be assembled into a single compound or inhibitor. Assembly may be proceed by visual inspection of the relationship of the compounds or moieties to each other on the three dimensional image displayed on a computer screen in relation to the structure coordinates of the BAX BIM BH3 NMR binding studies. This could then be followed by manual model building using software such as Quanta or SYBYL.

Once a compound has been designed or selected by the above methods the efficiency with which that compound modulates a BCL 2 family polypeptide can be tested and optimized by computational evaluation. An effective BCL 2 family polypeptide modulator must preferably demonstrate a relatively small difference in energy between its bound and free states i.e. a small deformation energy of binding .

A compound designed or selected as a modulator of BCL 2 family polypeptide can be further computationally optimized so that in its bound state it would preferably lack repulsive electrostatic interaction with the target protein. Such non complementary e.g. electrostatic interactions include repulsive charge charge dipole dipole and charge dipole interactions. Specifically the sum of all electrostatic interactions between the modulator and the enzyme when the modulator is bound to BCL 2 family polypeptide preferably make a neutral or favorable contribution to the enthalpy of binding.

Specific computer software is available in the art to evaluate compound deformation energy and electrostatic interaction. Examples of programs designed for such uses include Gaussian 92 revision C M.

Other hardware systems and software packages will be known to those skilled in the art.

Furthermore fragment based drug discovery can be used to identify compounds which interact with the active site of BAX.

Int. Ed. 2003 42 4479 4482 .

Once a BCL 2 family polypeptide modulator has been optimally selected or designed as described herein substitutions can then be made in some of its atoms or side groups in order to improve or modify its binding properties again using the information provided by the interaction and specificity templates to identify regions amiable to modification. Generally initial substitutions are conservative i.e. the replacement group will have approximately the same size shape hydrophobicity and charge as the original group. It should of course be understood that components known in the art to alter conformation should be avoided. Such substituted chemical compounds may then be analyzed for efficiency of fit to BCL 2 family polypeptides by the same computer methods described in detail above.

In certain embodiments the modulators have a Kd for BCL 2 family polypeptides of less than 0.2 mM less than 0.1 mM less than 750 M less than 500 M less than 250 M less than 100 M less than 50 M less than 500 nM less than 250 nM less than 50 nM less than 30 nm less than 20 nM less than 10 nM less than 5 nM less than 3 nM less than 1 nM or less than 0.5 nM.

Designed modulators can be further evaluated using in vitro or in vivo assays known in the art and described herein.

Determining the ability of a compound found to bind the active site of a BCL 2 family polypeptide based on computer modeling library screening and or fragment based drug discovery can be evaluate further for BCL 2 family polypeptide interaction by testing direct binding. Determining the ability of a test compound to bind to a BCL 2 family polypeptide can be accomplished for example by coupling the BCL 2 family polypeptide or compound with a radioisotope or enzymatic label such that binding of the BCL 2 family polypeptide to the potential modulator can be determined by detecting the labeled BCL 2 family polypeptide in a complex. For example a compound can be labeled with I S C or H either directly or indirectly and the radioisotope detected by direct counting of radioemmission or by scintillation counting. Alternatively the compound can be enzymatically labeled with for example horseradish peroxidase alkaline phosphatase or luciferase and the enzymatic label detected by determination of conversion of an appropriate substrate to product. As a further example the compound can be labelled with fluorescein and binding interactions between ligand and BCL 2 family polypeptide quantitated using a fluorescence polarization assay. Binding can also be measured by HSQC NMR as described herein.

In other embodiments determining the ability of the modulator to bind to BCL 2 family polypeptides can be determined by detecting induction of a downstream event e.g. change in conformation oligomerization state or subcellular localization of the polypeptide apoptosis release of mitochondrial cytochrome c etc. or detecting another BCL 2 family regulated cellular response.

In another embodiment the assay is a cell free assay in which a BCL 2 family protein or biologically active portion thereof containing an active site is contacted with a test compound and the ability of the test compound to modulate the activity of the BCL 2 family protein or biologically active portion thereof is determined. Determining the ability of the test compound to modulate the activity of a BCL 2 family protein can be accomplished for example by determining the ability of the BCL 2 family protein to bind to another BCL 2 family target molecule e.g. BAX binding to a hydrocarbon stapled BIM BH3 polypeptide in the presence of the test compound.

Determining the ability of the BCL 2 family protein to bind to a target molecule can also be accomplished using a technology such as real time Biomolecular Interaction Analysis BIA . Sjolander S. and Urbaniczky C. 1991 Anal. Chem. 63 2338 2345 and Szabo et al. 1995 Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 5 699 705. As used herein BIA is a technology for studying biospecific interactions in real time without labeling any of the interactants e.g. BLAcore . Changes in the optical phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance SPR can be used as an indication of real time reactions between biological molecules.

In an alternative embodiment determining the ability of the test compound to modulate the activity of a BCL 2 family protein can be accomplished by determining the ability of the BCL 2 family protein to modulate the activity of a downstream BCL 2 family target molecule. For example the activity of the effector molecule on an appropriate target can be determined or the binding of the effector to an appropriate target can be determined as previously described.

In yet another embodiment the cell free assay involves contacting a BCL 2 family protein e.g. BAX or biologically active portion thereof containing the active site with a known compound which binds the BCL 2 family protein e.g. a hydrocarbon stapled BIM BH3 polypeptide to form an assay and determining the ability of the test compound to interact with the BCL 2 family protein wherein determining the ability of the test compound to interact with the BCL 2 family protein comprises determining the ability of the test compound to preferentially bind to or modulate the activity of a BCL 2 family protein and displace the known compound.

In more than one embodiment of the above assay methods of the present invention it may be desirable to immobilize either the BCL 2 family polypeptide or its target molecule to facilitate separation of complexed from uncomplexed forms of one or both of the proteins as well as to accommodate automation of the assay. Binding of a test compound to a BCL 2 family protein or interaction of a BCL 2 family protein with a target molecule in the presence and absence of a candidate compound can be accomplished in any vessel suitable for containing the reactants. Examples of such vessels include microtiter plates test tubes and microcentrifuge tubes. In one embodiment a fusion protein can be provided which adds a domain that allows one or both of the proteins to be bound to a matrix. For example glutathione S transferase BCL 2 family fusion proteins or glutathione S transferase target fusion proteins can be adsorbed onto glutathione SEPHAROSE beads Sigma Chemical St. Louis Mo. or glutathione derivatized microtiter plates which are then combined with the test compound or the test compound and either the non adsorbed target protein or BCL 2 family protein and the mixture incubated under conditions conducive to complex formation e.g. at physiological conditions for salt and pH . Following incubation the beads or microtiter plate wells are washed to remove any unbound components the matrix immobilized in the case of beads complex determined either directly or indirectly for example as described above. Alternatively the complexes can be dissociated from the matrix and the level of BCL 2 family binding or activity determined using standard techniques.

Other techniques for immobilizing proteins on matrices can also be used in the assays of the invention. For example either a BCL 2 family protein or a BCL 2 family target molecule can be immobilized utilizing conjugation of biotin and streptavidin. Biotinylated BCL 2 family protein or target molecules can be prepared from biotin NHS N hydroxy succinimide using techniques well known in the art e.g. biotinylation kit Pierce Chemicals Rockford Ill. and immobilized in the wells of streptavidin coated 96 well plates Pierce Chemical . Alternatively antibodies reactive with BCL 2 family protein or target molecules but which do not interfere with binding of the BCL 2 family protein to its target molecule can be derivatized to the wells of the plate and unbound target or BCL 2 family protein trapped in the wells by antibody conjugation. Methods for detecting such complexes in addition to those described above for the GST immobilized complexes include immunodetection of complexes using antibodies reactive with the BCL 2 family protein or target molecule as well as enzyme linked assays which rely on detecting an enzymatic activity associated with the BCL 2 family protein or target molecule.

The compounds that bind the active site of BCL 2 family polypeptides may be demonstrated to inhibit tumor cell number in vitro or in vivo using a variety of assays known in the art or described herein. Such assays can use cells of a cancer cell line or cells from a patient in the presence and absence of the compound of interest. Preferably the cell has a deregulated BCL 2 family polypeptide pathway. The ability of a compound or a regimen of the invention to reduce the number of cancer cells or inhibit their proliferation can be assessed by methods known in the art and described herein.

The invention provides methods also referred to herein as screening assays for identifying compounds which bind to an active site and modulate the activity of one or more BCL 2 family proteins.

The binding affinity of polypeptides described herein can be determined using for example a titration binding assay. A BCL 2 family polypeptide or polypeptide comprising a BH domain e.g. BAX etc. can be exposed to varying concentrations of a candidate compound i.e. polypeptide small molecule e.g. 1 nM 10 nM 100 nM 1 uM 10 uM 100 uM 1 mM and 10 mM in the presence of a substrate such as a fluorescently labeled BH3 containing polypeptide or a fragment thereof e.g. BID BAD BAK BAX etc. . The effect of each concentration of candidate compound is then analyzed to determine the effect of the candidate compound on BCL 2 family polypeptide binding activity at varying concentrations which can be used to calculate the Ki of the candidate compound. The candidate compound can modulate BCL 2 type activity in a competitive or non competitive manner. Direct binding assays can also be performed between BCL 2 family proteins and fluorescently labeled candidate compounds to determine the Kd for the binding interaction. Candidate compounds could also be screened for biological activity in vitro for example by measuring their dose responsive efficacy in triggering BCL 2 family protein conformational change as measured by conformation specific antibodies e.g. BAX 6A7 antibody or HSQC NMR analysis a change in BCL 2 family protein e.g. BAX oligomerization state as monitored by size exclusion chromatography SEC based analysis or dynamic light scattering fluorophore or protein conjugated fluorophore induced release from liposomes and or cytochrome c release from purified mitochondria . Cell permeability screening assays are also envisioned in which fluorescently or otherwise labeled candidate compounds are applied to intact cells which are then assayed for cellular fluorescence by microscopy or high throughput cellular fluorescence detection.

A compound pharmaceutical composition or regimen of the invention is preferably tested in vitro and then in vivo for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity prior to use in humans. For example assays which can be used to determine whether administration of a specific compound is effective include cell culture assays in which a patient tissue sample e.g. cancer cell is grown in culture and exposed to or otherwise contacted with a compound of the invention and the effect of such compound upon the tissue sample is observed. The tissue sample can be obtained by biopsy or blood bone marrow draw from the patient. This test allows the identification of the therapeutically most effective therapy e.g. prophylactic or therapeutic agent for each individual patient.

The assays described herein can be performed with individual candidate compounds or can be performed with a plurality of candidate compounds. Where the assays are performed with a plurality of candidate compounds the assays can be performed using mixtures of candidate compounds or can be run in parallel reactions with each reaction having a single candidate compound. The test compounds or agents can be obtained using any of the numerous approaches in combinatorial library methods known in the art.

In a preferred embodiment cell based assay is performed on a compound which is known to bind an active site e.g. identified via computer modeling direct binding assay NMR or other method of a BCL 2 family polypeptide in order to determine whether the compound also modulates the activity of the BCL 2 family polypeptide.

In one embodiment an assay is a cell based assay in which a cell that expresses a BCL 2 family protein or biologically active portion thereof is contacted with a candidate compound and the ability of the candidate compound to bind to an active site and modulate BCL 2 family type activity is determined e.g. in some instances increase in apoptosis and in other instances decrease apoptosis via intrinsic or extrinsic cell death pathways . Determining the ability of the test compound to modulate BCL 2 type activity within cells can be accomplished by monitoring for example release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria or other relevant physiologic readout e.g. annexin V staining MTT assay caspase activity assay TUNEL assay change in mitochondrial membrane potential .

In vitro anti tumor activity of the compounds found to bind to the active site of a BCL 2 polypeptide can be assayed by measuring the ability of the compound to kill tumor cells. Examples of cell lines include human lung A549 resistant human lung with low topo II activity A549 VP murine melanoma B16 human colon tumor HCT116 human clone tumor with elevated p170 levels HCTVM human colon tumor with low topo II activity HCTVP P388 murine lymph leukemia cells and human colon carcinoma cell line Moser and many others known in the art.

Tumor inhibition assays are described for example in Kelly et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 166 208 and in Pandley et al. J. Antibiot. 3 11 1389 401 1981 . In one assay the cells are allowed to grow for a 24 hour period under standard conditions. After the cells are allowed to attach to the plate for 24 hours e.g. a 96 well flat bottom plate the cells are incubated for 72 hours with serially diluted concentrations of the BCL 2 family modulator compound. From these data the concentration of the compound at which 50 of the cells are killed or growth inhibited IC50 is determined.

The compounds of the invention can also be demonstrated to inhibit tumor formation in vivo. The compounds pharmaceutical compositions and regimens of the invention can be tested in suitable animal model systems prior to use in humans. Such animal model systems include but are not limited to rats mice chicken cows monkeys pigs dogs rabbits etc. Any animal system well known in the art may be used. Several aspects of the procedure may vary said aspects include but are not limited to the temporal regime of administering the therapeutic modalities e.g. prophylactic and or therapeutic agents whether such therapeutic modalities are administered separately or as an admixture and the frequency of administration of the therapeutic modalities.

In vivo anti tumor activity of BCL 2 family modulator compounds of the invention can be assayed by a reduction of tumor cells in mammals e.g. mice and a resulting increase in survival time compared to untreated tumor bearing animals. For example CDF1 mice are injected interperitoneally with a suspension of P388 murine lymph leukemia cells Ehrlich carcinoma cells B16 melanoma cells or Meth A fibrosarcoma cells. Some of the injected mice are then treated interperitoneally with a BCL 2 family modulator compound of the invention and other mice are treated with saline. The in vivo activity of the compound is then determined in terms of the T C which is the ratio of the mean survival time of the treated group to the mean survival time of the saline treated group times 100.

For example a compound of the invention can be administered to a test animal in one embodiment a test animal predisposed to develop a type of tumor and the test animal subsequently examined for a decreased incidence of tumor formation in comparison with an animal not administered the compound. Alternatively a compound can be administered to test animals having tumors e.g. animals in which tumors have been induced by introduction of malignant neoplastic or transformed cells or by administration of a carcinogen and subsequently examining the tumors in the test animals for tumor regression in comparison to animals not administered the compound. A compound of the invention is considered effective in treating a hyperpoliferative disorder when administration of a therapeutically effective amount increases time to tumor progression or increases survival time by at least 5 preferably at least 10 at least 15 at least 20 at least 25 at least 30 at least 35 at least 40 at least 45 at least 50 at least 55 at least 60 at least 65 at least 70 at least 75 at least 80 at least 85 at least 90 at least 95 or at least 100 . Similarly a compound of the invention is considered effective in treating a hyperpoliferative disorder when administration of a therapeutically effective amount decreases the rate of tumor growth decreases tumor mass decreases the number of metastases by at least 10 at least 15 at least 20 at least 25 at least 30 at least 35 at least 40 at least 45 at least 50 at least 55 at least 60 at least 65 at least 70 at least 75 at least 80 at least 85 at least 90 at least 95 or at least 100 . Such results can be determined by one having ordinary skill in the relevant art e.g. oncologist.

Further any assays known to those skilled in the art can be used to evaluate the prophylactic and or therapeutic utility of a compound or pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein for disorder associated with excessive cellular proliferation or cellular death or one or more symptoms thereof.

Agents of the present invention are useful for treating cells in which the cell death signal is down regulated and the affected cell has an inappropriately diminished propensity for cell death which is referred to herein as being in a decreased apoptotic state. The invention further provides methods for the administration to a subject of a therapeutically effective amount of an agent to treat an apoptosis associated disease in which it is desirable to induce apoptosis in certain types of cells such as virus infected or autoantibody expressing cells. Typically the agent is substantially purified prior to administration. The subject can be an animal including but not limited to cows pigs horses chickens cats dogs and the like and is typically a mammal and in a particular embodiment human. In another specific embodiment a non human mammal is the subject.

The present invention provides for both prophylactic and therapeutic methods of treating a subject at risk of or susceptible to a disorder or having a disorder associated with aberrant e.g. insufficient or excessive BCL 2 family member expression or activity e.g. extrinsic or intrinsic apoptotic pathway abnormalities . As used herein the term treatment is defined as the application or administration of a therapeutic agent to a patient or application or administration of a therapeutic agent to an isolated tissue or cell line from a patient who has a disease a symptom of disease or a predisposition toward a disease with the purpose to cure heal alleviate relieve alter remedy ameliorate improve or affect the disease the symptoms of disease or the predisposition toward disease. A therapeutic agent includes but is not limited to small molecules peptides antibodies ribozymes antisense oligonucleotides other nucleic acid compositions and combinations thereof.

BCL 2 type disorders can be caused at least in part by an abnormal level of one or more BCL 2 family members e.g. over or under expression of BCL 2 or by the presence of one or more BCL 2 family members exhibiting abnormal activity. As such the invention is directed to the reduction in the level and or activity of the BCL 2 family member or the enhancement of the level and or activity of the BCL 2 family member which would bring about the amelioration of disorder symptoms. For example a tumor maintained by excessive levels of an anti apoptotic protein such as BCL 2 can be treated with a BAX activating modulator compound in order to surmount or circumvent apoptotic blockade and directly induce BAX mediated apoptosis.

The compounds of the invention can be used to treat and prevent cancers and neoplastic conditions. As used herein the terms cancer hyperproliferative and neoplastic refer to cells having the capacity for autonomous growth and defective cell death i.e. an abnormal state or condition characterized by rapidly proliferating cell growth and or apoptotic blockade. Hyperproliferative and neoplastic disease states may be categorized as pathologic i.e. characterizing or constituting a disease state or may be categorized as non pathologic i.e. a deviation from normal but not associated with a disease state. The term is meant to include all types of cancerous growths or oncogenic processes metastatic tissues or malignantly transformed cells tissues or organs irrespective of histopathologic type or stage of invasiveness. Pathologic hyperproliferative cells occur in disease states characterized by malignant tumor growth. Examples of non pathologic hyperproliferative cells include proliferation of cells associated with wound repair.

Examples of cellular proliferative and or differentiative disorders include cancer e.g. carcinoma sarcoma or metastatic disorders. The compounds can act as novel therapeutic agents for controlling breast cancer ovarian cancer colon cancer lung cancer metastasis of such cancers and the like. A metastatic tumor can arise from a multitude of primary tumor types including but not limited to those of breast lung liver colon and ovarian origin.

Examples of cancers or neoplastic conditions include but are not limited to a fibrosarcoma myosarcoma liposarcoma chondrosarcoma osteogenic sarcoma chordoma angiosarcoma endotheliosarcoma lymphangiosarcoma lymphangioendotheliosarcoma synovioma mesothelioma Ewing s tumor leiomyosarcoma rhabdomyosarcoma gastric cancer esophageal cancer rectal cancer pancreatic cancer ovarian cancer prostate cancer uterine cancer cancer of the head and neck skin cancer brain cancer squamous cell carcinoma sebaceous gland carcinoma papillary carcinoma papillary adenocarcinoma cystadenocarcinoma medullary carcinoma bronchogenic carcinoma renal cell carcinoma hepatoma bile duct carcinoma choriocarcinoma seminoma embryonal carcinoma Wilm s tumor cervical cancer testicular cancer small cell lung carcinoma non small cell lung carcinoma bladder carcinoma epithelial carcinoma glioma astrocytoma medulloblastoma craniopharyngioma ependymoma pinealoma hemangioblastoma acoustic neuroma oligodendroglioma meningioma melanoma neuroblastoma retinoblastoma leukemia lymphoma or Kaposi sarcoma.

Examples of proliferative disorders include hematopoietic neoplastic disorders. As used herein the term hematopoietic neoplastic disorders includes diseases involving hyperplastic neoplastic cells of hematopoietic origin e.g. arising from myeloid lymphoid or erythroid lineages or precursor cells thereof. Preferably the diseases arise from poorly differentiated acute leukemias e.g. erythroblastic leukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Additional exemplary myeloid disorders include but are not limited to acute promyeloid leukemia APML acute myelogenous leukemia AML and chronic myelogenous leukemia CML reviewed in Vaickus L. 1991 Crit. Rev. in Oncol. Hemotol. 11 267 97 lymphoid malignancies include but are not limited to acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL which includes B lineage ALL and T lineage ALL chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL prolymphocytic leukemia PLL hairy cell leukemia HLL and Waldenstrom s macroglobulinemia WM . Additional forms of malignant lymphomas include but are not limited to non Hodgkin lymphoma and variants thereof peripheral T cell lymphomas adult T cell leukemia lymphoma ATL cutaneous T cell lymphoma CTCL large granular lymphocytic leukemia LGF Hodgkin s disease and Reed Stemberg disease.

Examples of cellular proliferative and or differentiative disorders of the breast include but are not limited to proliferative breast disease including e.g. epithelial hyperplasia sclerosing adenosis and small duct papillomas tumors e.g. stromal tumors such as fibroadenoma phyllodes tumor and sarcomas and epithelial tumors such as large duct papilloma carcinoma of the breast including in situ noninvasive carcinoma that includes ductal carcinoma in situ including Paget s disease and lobular carcinoma in situ and invasive infiltrating carcinoma including but not limited to invasive ductal carcinoma invasive lobular carcinoma medullary carcinoma colloid mucinous carcinoma tubular carcinoma and invasive papillary carcinoma and miscellaneous malignant neoplasms. Disorders in the male breast include but are not limited to gynecomastia and carcinoma.

Examples of cellular proliferative and or differentiative disorders of the lung include but are not limited to bronchogenic carcinoma including paraneoplastic syndromes bronchioloalveolar carcinoma neuroendocrine tumors such as bronchial carcinoid miscellaneous tumors and metastatic tumors pathologies of the pleura including inflammatory pleural effusions noninflammatory pleural effusions pneumothorax and pleural tumors including solitary fibrous tumors pleural fibroma and malignant mesothelioma.

Examples of cellular proliferative and or differentiative disorders of the colon include but are not limited to non neoplastic polyps adenomas familial syndromes colorectal carcinogenesis colorectal carcinoma and carcinoid tumors.

Examples of cellular proliferative and or differentiative disorders of the liver include but are not limited to nodular hyperplasias adenomas and malignant tumors including primary carcinoma of the liver and metastatic tumors.

Examples of cellular proliferative and or differentiative disorders of the ovary include but are not limited to ovarian tumors such as tumors of coelomic epithelium serous tumors mucinous tumors endometeriod tumors clear cell adenocarcinoma cystadenofibroma brenner tumor surface epithelial tumors germ cell tumors such as mature benign teratomas monodermal teratomas immature malignant teratomas dysgerminoma endodermal sinus tumor choriocarcinoma sex cord stomal tumors such as granulosa theca cell tumors thecomafibromas androblastomas hill cell tumors and gonadoblastoma and metastatic tumors such as Krukenberg tumors.

The compounds described herein can also be used to treat or prevent conditions characterised by overactive cell death or cellular death due to physiologic insult etc. Some examples of conditions characterized by premature or unwanted cell death are or alternatively unwanted or excessive cellular proliferation include but are not limited to ischemia hypocellular hypoplastic acellular aplastic or hypercellular hyperplastic conditions. Some examples include hematologic disorders including but not limited to fanconi anemia aplastic anemia thalaessemia congenital neutropenia myelodysplasia.

Compounds of the invention that act to decrease apoptosis can be used to treat disorders associated with an undesirable level of cell death. Thus the anti apoptotic compounds of the invention can be used to treat disorders such as those that lead to cell death associated with viral infection e.g. infection associated with infection with human immunodeficiency virus HIV . A wide variety of neurological diseases are characterized by the gradual loss of specific sets of neurons and the anti apoptotic peptides of the infection can be used in the treatment of these disorders. Such disorders include Alzheimer s disease Parkinson s disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS retinitis pigmentosa spinal muscular atrophy and various forms of cerebellar degeneration. The cell loss in these diseases does not induce an inflammatory response and apoptosis appears to be the mechanism of cell death. In addition a number of hematologic diseases are associated with a decreased production of blood cells. These disorders include anemia associated with chronic disease aplastic anemia chronic neutropenia and the myelodysplastic syndromes. Disorders of blood cell production such as myelodysplastic syndrome and some forms of aplastic anemia are associated with increased apoptotic cell death within the bone marrow. These disorders could result from the activation of genes that promote apoptosis acquired deficiencies in stromal cells or hematopoietic survival factors or the direct effects of toxins and mediators of immune responses. Two common disorders associated with cell death are myocardial infarctions and stroke. In both disorders cells within the central area of ischemia which is produced in the event of acute loss of blood flow appear to die rapidly as a result of necrosis. However outside the central ischemic zone cells die over a more protracted time period and morphologically appear to die by apoptosis. The anti apoptotic compounds of the invention can be used to treat all such disorders associated with undesirable cell death.

In one embodiment the compounds of the invention are administered as monotherapy for the prevention treatment and or management of cancer.

One aspect of the invention relates to a method of preventing treating and or managing cancer in a patient e.g. a human patient the method comprising administering to the patient a prophylactically effective regimen or a therapeutically effective regimen the regimen comprising administering to the patient a compound of the invention or a composition of the invention wherein the patient has been diagnosed with cancer. The amount of a compound of the invention used in the prophylactic and or therapeutic regimens which will be effective in the prevention treatment and or management of cancer can be based on the currently prescribed dosage of the compound as well as assessed by methods disclosed herein.

In one embodiment of this aspect the patient has received or is receiving another therapy. In another embodiment of this aspect the patient has not previously received a therapy for the prevention treatment and or management of the cancer.

The medical practitioner can diagnose the patient using any of the conventional cancer screening methods including but not limited to physical examination e.g. prostate examination breast examination lymph nodes examination abdominal examination skin surveillance visual methods e.g. colonoscopy bronchoscopy endoscopy PAP smear analyses cervical cancer stool guaiac analyses blood tests e.g. complete blood count CBC test blood chemistries including liver function tests prostate specific antigen PSA test carcinoembryonic antigen CEA test cancer antigen CA 125 test alpha fetoprotein AFP karyotyping analyses bone marrow analyses e.g. in cases of hematological malignancies histology cytology a sputum analysis and imaging methods e.g. computed tomography CT magnetic resonance imaging MRI ultrasound X ray imaging mammograph imaging bone scans .

Another aspect of the invention relates to a method of preventing treating and or managing a solid tumor in a patient e.g. a human patient the method comprising administering to a patient in need thereof a prophylactically effective regimen or a therapeutically effective regimen the regimen comprising administering to the patient a compound or composition of the invention wherein the patient has been diagnosed with a solid tumor and wherein the patient has undergone a primary therapy to reduce the bulk of the tumor.

Another aspect of the invention relates to a method of preventing treating and or managing cancer the method comprising administering to a patient in need thereof a prophylactically effective regimen or a therapeutically effective regimen the regimen comprising administering to the patient a compound of the invention as described above or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof wherein the patient received another therapy. In some embodiments the prior therapy is for example chemotherapy radioimmunotherapy toxin therapy prodrug activating enzyme therapy antibody therapy surgical therapy immunotherapy radiation therapy targeted therapy or any combination thereof.

In some embodiments the prior therapy has failed in the patient. In some embodiments the therapeutically effective regimen comprising administration of a compound of the invention is administered to the patient immediately after patient has undergone the prior therapy. For instance in certain embodiments the outcome of the prior therapy may be unknown before the patient is administered a compound of the invention.

Another aspect of the invention relates to a method of preventing treating and or managing cancer in a patient e.g. a human patient the method comprising administering to a patient in need thereof a prophylactically effective regimen or a therapeutically effective regimen the regimen comprising administering to the patient a compound or composition of the invention wherein the compound or composition of the invention is administered at a dose that is lower than the human equivalent dosage HED of the no observed adverse effect level NOAEL over a period of three months four months six months nine months 1 year 2 years 3 years 4 years or more. The NOAEL as determined in animal studies is useful in determining the maximum recommended starting dose for human clinical trials. For instance the NOAELs can be extrapolated to determine human equivalent dosages. Typically such extrapolations between species are conducted based on the doses that are normalized to body surface area i.e. mg m . In specific embodiments the NOAELs are determined in mice hamsters rats ferrets guinea pigs rabbits dogs primates primates monkeys marmosets squirrel monkeys baboons micropigs or minipigs. For a discussion on the use of NOAELs and their extrapolation to determine human equivalent doses see U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research CDER Pharmacology and Toxicology July 2005.

In certain embodiments the regimens comprise administering a prophylactically effective regimen and or a therapeutically effective regimen wherein the regimen results in a reduction in the cancer cell population in the patient. In one embodiment the patient undergoing the regimen is monitored to determine whether the regimen has resulted in a reduction in the cancer cell population in the patient.

Typically the monitoring of the cancer cell population is conducted by detecting the number or amount of cancer cells in a specimen extracted from the patient. Methods of detecting the number or amount of cancer cells in a specimen are known in the art. This monitoring step is typically performed at least 1 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 15 16 18 20 or 30 days after the patient begins receiving the regimen.

In some embodiments the specimen may be a blood specimen wherein the number or amount of cancer cells per unit of volume e.g. 1 mL or other measured unit e.g. per unit field in the case of a histological analysis is quantitated. The cancer cell population in certain embodiments can be determined as a percentage of the total blood cells.

In other embodiments the specimen extracted from the patient is a tissue specimen e.g. a biopsy extracted from suspected cancerous tissue where the number or amount of cancer cells can be measured for example on the basis of the number or amount of cancer cells per unit weight of the tissue.

The number or amount of cancer cells in the extracted specimen can be compared with the numbers or amounts of cancer cells measured in reference samples to assess the efficacy of the regimen and amelioration of the cancer under therapy. In one embodiment the reference sample is a specimen extracted from the patient undergoing therapy wherein the specimen from the patient is extracted at an earlier time point e.g. prior to receiving the regimen as a baseline reference sample or at an earlier time point while receiving the therapy . In another embodiment the reference sample is extracted from a healthy noncancer afflicted patient.

In other embodiments the cancer cell population in the extracted specimen can be compared with a predetermined reference range. In a specific embodiment the predetermined reference range is based on the number or amount of cancer cells obtained from a population s of patients suffering from the same type of cancer as the patient undergoing the therapy.

If the reduction in the cancer cell population is judged too small upon comparing the number amount or percentage of cancer cells in the specimen extracted from the patients undergoing therapy with the reference specimen then the medical practitioner has a number of options to adjust the therapeutic regimen. For instance the medical practitioner can then either increase the dosage of the compound or composition of the invention administered the frequency of the administration the duration of administration or any combination thereof. In a specific embodiment after the determination is made a second effective amount of a compound or composition of the invention can be administered to the patient.

In other embodiments the regimens comprise administering a compound or composition of the invention wherein the regimen results in a reduction in the number amount or percentage of cancer cells and a reduction in the number amount or percentage of cancer cells in the patient.

The amount of a compound of the invention used in the prophylactic and or therapeutic regimens which will be effective in the prevention treatment and or management of cancer can be based on the currently prescribed dosage of the compound as well as assessed by methods disclosed herein and known in the art. The frequency and dosage will vary also according to factors specific for each patient depending on the specific compounds administered the severity of the cancerous condition the route of administration as well as age body weight response and the past medical history of the patient. For example the dosage of a compound of the invention which will be effective in the treatment prevention and or management of cancer can be determined by administering the compound to an animal model such as e.g. the animal models disclosed herein or known to those skilled in the art. In addition in vitro assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges.

In some embodiments the prophylactic and or therapeutic regimens comprise titrating the dosages administered to the patient so as to achieve a specified measure of therapeutic efficacy. Such measures include a reduction in the cancer cell population in the patient.

The following examples are provided merely as illustrative of various aspects of the invention and shall not be construed to limit the invention in any way.

A Stabilized Alpha Helix of BCL 2 Domain or SAHB corresponding to a 21 amino acid fragment of human BIM BH3 BIM SAHB exhibited 81 alpha helicity in aqueous solution bound to pro apoptotic BAX with 24 nM affinity and was prepared as previously described Walensky L. D. et al. 24 2 199 210 2006 . An alpha helical N acetylated and C amidated 20 mer BIM SAHB derivative BIM SAHB and other analogs were prepared for structural studies. BIM SAHBformed a 1 1 stable complex with BAX in aqueous solution at concentrations up to 0.5 mM. The circular dichroism spectra of BIM SAHBs demonstrated that these engineered peptide recapitulate the alpha helical structure of native BH3 domains. Heteronuclear Single Quantum Correlation HSQC titrations employing BIM SAHBand H N BAX revealed chemical shifts of a discrete subset of BAX residues including Glu17 Met20 Lys21 Thr22 Ala24 Leu25 Leu27 Gln28 Gly29 Ile31 Gln 32 Asp 33 of alpha helix 1 and Pro130 Glu131 Ile 133 Arg 134 Thr135 Met137 Gly138 Trp139 Leu141 Asp142 Phe143 Arg145 Glu146 Arg 147 of alpha helix 6. Significant changes were also observed for the side chain NHof Gln28 Gln32 and Gln52. H C correlation spectra of BAX in complex with BIM SAHBwere also performed and noticeable changes of the H C resonances were observed for the side chains of hydrophobic residues localized to the same regions including Leu27 C Hand C H Ile31 C H and Ile133 C H. The residues described above colocalize at the intersection of alpha helices 1 and 6 at the surface of BAX forming a hydrophobic patch comprised of residues including Met20 Ala24 Leu25 Leu27 Gly29 Ile31 Leu47 Val50 Phe92 Phe93 Ile 133 Arg 134 Met137 Gly138 Trp139 Leu141 Phe143 surrounded by a perimeter of charged and hydrophilic residues including Glu17 Lys21 Thr22 Gln28 Gln 32 Asp 33 Asp48 Gln52 Asp53 Thr56 Arg89 Glu131 Arg 134 Thr135 Asp142 Arg145 Glu146 Arg147 . In the BAX structure the 1 and 6 helices are positioned adjacent to one another and the residues listed above localize to a discrete site at the juxtaposition of these helices on one side of the protein structure . No residues on the opposite face of the protein are affected by BIM SAHB titration under these conditions . Thus these structural data reveal a novel binding site that is distinct in location from the canonical BH3 binding site reported for anti apoptotic proteins Muchmore et al. 381 6580 335 341 1996 Sattler M. et al. 275 5302 983 986 1997 . .

To orient BIM SAHB at the BAX interaction site we conducted paramagnetic relaxation enhancement PRE NMR experiments which can be performed on a time scale that is compatible with the lifespan of the complex under NMR conditions. H N BAX HSQC spectra were acquired with methane thiosulphonate MTSL derivatized BIM SAHB compounds in the oxidized state and then repeated after nitroxide reduction. Of note the chemical shift perturbation maps of BAX in complex with BIM SAHB and the MTSL labeled derivatives demonstrate consistent changes in BAX helices 1 and 6 and in the 1 2 loop. Whereas the intensity of BAX 1 residues are predominantly reduced in the presence of oxidized C terminal label the intensity of BAX 6 residues are predominantly reduced in the presence of oxidized N terminal label . As an example BIM SAHBcaused marked signal suppression of Ser16 1 but had essentially no effect on Asp142 6 top panel whereas BIM SAHBhad no effect on Ser16 1 but reduced the Asp142 6 signal bottom panel . Because the degree of PRE correlates with the distance between the nitroxide label and the affected BAX residues Battiste J. L. Wagner G. 39 18 5355 5365 2000 structure calculations using restraints derived from PRE and chemical shift perturbation data were performed to define the orientation of BIM SAHB at the novel BAX site. Indeed the calculated structures converged to place BIM SAHB perpendicular to BAX helices 1 and 6 with the N to C terminus directionality disposed right to left and defined the key interactions between BIM BH3 and BAX . Whereas hydrophobic residues Ile 148 Ala 149 Leu 152 Ile 155 Gly 156 and Phe 159 of BIM SAHB engage the BAX hydrophobic groove charged and hydrophilic residues Arg 153 Arg 154 Asp 157 Glu 158 Asn 160 and Tyr 163 of BIM SAHB interact with complementary charged and hydrophilic residues on BAX.

In contrast to the stable inhibitory interactions of BIM BH3 with anti apoptotic proteins the BAX activating interaction triggers a dynamic continuum of events that includes BAX conformational change and oligomerization. Of particular interest NMR resonances of residues in the 1 2 loop of BAX shifted significantly upon BIM SAHB binding. In monomeric BAX the center of the loop weakly associates with residues Ile133 and Met 137 of the 6 helix Suzuki Tjandra 103 4 645 654 2000 . Changes observed in the loop residues can readily be explained by the shift of the loop conformation into an open form upon BIM SAHB binding. Because loop displacement upon ligand engagement may initiate a conformational change of BAX we investigated whether BIM SAHB binding could directly activate BAX in solution. We monitored both the conversion of BAX from monomer to oligomer by size exclusion chromatography SEC and the exposure of its buried N terminal residues using the 6A7 antibody which selectively detects the conformational change associated with BAX activation Hsu Youle 272 21 13829 13834 1997 . We find that BIM SAHB triggers dose dependent oligomerization of BAX at room temperature with complete conversion achieved using 4 fold molar excess BIM SAHB after only 15 minutes incubation . This BIM SAHB induced oligomerization correlated with exposure of the N terminal epitope of BAX as recognized by the 6A7 antibody . Thus the transient stability of the BIM SAHB BAX complex we observe by NMR correlates with the interaction triggered BAX conformational change and oligomerization that we detect biochemically.

To confirm that the SEC based detection of BIM SAHB induced BAX oligomerization reflects functional activation of BAX for its release activity we performed correlative liposomal and mitochondrial assays. In liposomal assays that explicitly explore the capacity of BIM SAHB to directly trigger functional BAX activation in the absence of other factors the combination of BIM SAHB and BAX yielded dose responsive liposomal release of entrapped FITC dextran top panel . The specificity of BIM SAHB activity was confirmed by abrogation of activity upon BIM SAHB R153D mutagenesis or by adding anti apoptotic BCL X C bottom panel Likewise in mitochondrial release assays that employed BAX BAK doubly deficient mouse liver mitochondria prepared from Alb creBaxBak mice BIM SAHB induced dose responsive BAX mediated cytochrome c release . Thus in four distinct in vitro assays that measure ligand induced BAX activation BIM SAHB directly and dose responsively triggered BAX.

To confirm the specificity of the BIM SAHB interaction with BAX several point mutations of the BIM BH3 SAHB binding surface were generated and then tested for functional activation of BAX by performing an in vitro BAX oligomerization assay and mitochondrial cytochrome c release assay. In each case reverse polarity R153D D157R and hydrophobic to charged I155E mutations along the interaction surface abrogated ligand induced oligomerization of wild type BAX and BAX mediated cytochrome c release . To validate the specificity of the BAX interaction site BAX residues K21 and R134 were examined as they exhibited pronounced NMR chemical shifts upon BIM SAHB binding. Recombinant BAX bearing single reverse polarity mutations K21E and R134E were generated and then subjected to the BIM SAHB induced BAX oligomerization assay which revealed significant impairment of BIM SAHB induced BAX K21E and BAX R134D activation . Taken together these mutagenesis studies highlight the exquisite specificity of the BIM BH3 BAX interaction and implicate engagement of the novel binding site as a trigger mechanism for initiating BAX activation.

We next performed a staple scan to demonstrate and link the specificity of BIM SAHB induced BAX activation to interaction at the novel site. By performing a staple scan that effectively replaces pairs of amino acid residues within the core BH3 sequence with crosslinked norleucine like side chains we simultaneously address which residues are essential to the functional interaction between BIM BH3 and BAX and further confirm which surface along the BIM BH3 helix is essential to BAX engagement . Substituting the non natural amino acid at positions W147 A149 E151 R153 R154 E158 or Y162 did not disrupt BIM SAHB induced BAX oligomerization or BAX mediated cytochrome c release . Indeed hydrocarbon staples located along the length of the helix at surfaces that do not face the hydrophobic contact site on BAX did not disrupt the functional interactions between the BIM SAHB analogs and BAX. However a staple position that replaced I148 and the highly conserved L152 and localizes to the hydrophobic contact surface for BAX on the BIM BH3 helix markedly decreased BAX oligomerization and BAX mediated cytochrome c release findings consistent with the near abrogation of BIM SAHB induced chemical shift perturbations of N BAX by BIM SAHB. In addition BAD SAHB which has the identical staple position as BIM SAHBbut otherwise contains distinct amino acid sequence did not bind or oligomerize BAX or induce BAX mediated cytochrome c release .

To further examine the impact of BAX K21E mutagenesis at the 1 6 interaction site we demonstrated that the reduction of BIM SAHB induced BAXactivation measured by the oligomerization assay was also reflected in blunted BAX mediated cytochrome c release in response to BIM SAHB . To determine if this single point mutation within the novel BAX binding site impacted the capacity to activate BAX in a cellular context we retrovirally reconstituted BaxBak mouse embryo fibroblasts DKO MEFs with either wild type or BAXand monitored apoptosis induction in response to BIM SAHB. Whereas BIM SAHB induced time dependent apoptosis of BAX reconstituted MEFs as quantitated by annexin V binding single K21E point mutation within the new BAX binding site reduced BIM SAHB triggered apoptosis . This decrease in BAX mediated apoptosis correlates with impaired activation of BAXby BIM SAHB in both oligomerization and cytochrome c release assays . As a further measure of specificity we found that R153D mutagenesis of BIM SAHB which eliminated its BAX activating capacity in the liposomal BAX oligomerization and cytochrome c release assays bottom panel 13b 13c respectively likewise abolished BIM SAHB induced activation of BAX and BAXin a cellular context .

To probe the broader physiologic impact of the novel BAX activation site we examined the apoptotic response of DKO MEFs reconstituted with BAX and BAXto staurosporine STS a general stimulus known to operate through endogenous BH3 only proteins including BIM. K21E mutagenesis impaired STS induced apoptosis as monitored by annexin V binding over time . The reduced activity of BAXwas also reflected by impaired cytochrome c release as detected by subcellular fractionation Western analysis and indirect immunofluorescence. The blunted response of BAX reconstituted DKO MEFs to STS is uniformly consistent with impaired activation of BAXby BIM SAHB in oligomerization cytochrome c release and cell based apoptosis assays . Thus the MEF studies extend the mechanistic relevance of direct BAX activation to a cellular context in which BAX mediated apoptosis is impaired by single amino acid mutagenesis at the novel BH3 interaction site. Taken together the in vitro and cell based mutagenesis experiments highlight the exquisite specificity of the BIM BH3 BAX interaction and implicate engagement of the novel binding site as a trigger mechanism for initiating BAX activation.

To determine if BIM SAHB specifically targets BAX in cells fluorescein isothiocyanate FITC derivatized analogs of the cell permeable BIM SAHBcompounds were applied to Jurkat T cells and cellular uptake by FACS analysis was recorded. Whereas BIM SAHBinduced dose dependent apoptosis induction in Jurkat T cells by 18 hours incubation BIM SAHB R153D had no effect. To document that BIM SAHB interacts with cytosolic BAX Jurkat T cells were incubated with FITC BIM SAHBcompounds for 4 hours followed by cellular lysis in 1 CHAPS and SAHB immunoprecipitation with anti FITC antibodies. Indeed FITC BIM SAHBwas capable of co immunoprecipitating BAX from the cytosol of Jurkat T cells. Thus BIM SAHB can penetrate intact cells and specifically engage cytosolic BAX in cells stimulated to undergo apoptosis.

Although the present invention is based in part on the identification of an active binding site in BAX it is contemplated that corresponding active binding sites are present in other BCL 2 family polypeptides given their overall high three dimensional structural conservation. These non BAX BCL 2 family polypeptide active sites that correspond to the BAX active site can be identified by amino acid sequence alignments between BAX and the test polypeptide by structural comparison or by a combination thereof. Such methods are known by those having ordinary skill in the art and are described herein. The invention provides methods for identifying homologous active sites in non BAX BCL 2 family and non BCL 2 family members via direct covalent intercalation of photoactivatable and crosslinkable derivatives of BH3 peptides or their mimetics to the target site followed by intercalation site identification by for example proteolysis fragment purification and mass spectrometry based analysis. To directly identify sites in BCL 2 polypeptides whose structures have not been solved the present invention contemplates generating high resolution solution structures of other BCL 2 family polypeptides including BOK and BAK and BCL X. Such structures can be determined by the method described below.

Full length human BOK and BAK cDNAs can be subcloned into the pTYB1 vector to generate chitin binding fusion proteins followed by chitin affinity chromatography DTT based chitin cleavage and gel filtration FPLC purification. Transformed BL21 DE3 cells are then grown at 37 C. and induced with 1 mM IPTG in either LB media for unlabeled protein or M9 minimal media substituted with N NHCl 1 g l with or without C glucose 2 g l to obtain uniformly N labeled protein or N C labeled protein respectively. Deuterated uniformly NC labeled proteins can be prepared by growing the cells in 75 DO supplemented with N NHCl and C glucose. NMR samples 0.5 1 mM are then prepared in a 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.5 in DO or HO DO 9 1 .

NMR spectra are recorded at 25 C. on a Bruker Avance 600 MHz 700 MHz or 800 MHz spectrometers equipped with a z shielded gradient and triple resonance cryoprobe. Chemical shift assignments are performed using standard techniques. For backbone assignments of H C N resonances the following triple resonance 3D experiments are recorded HNCO HNCACO HNCA HNCOCA HNCACB and CBCA CO NH on uniformly N C labeled protein in HO. Side chain assignments are performed using the following standard 3D experiments H N TOCSY HSQC C CO NH TOCSY H CCO NH TOCSY and HCCH TOCSY. Any ambiguous assignments can be further confirmed by analysis of the 3D C resolved H H NOESY experiments on uniformly N C labeled protein in DO. Aromatic sidechain H and C resonances are assigned by the combination of 2D HMQC and 3D C resolved H H NOESY. Structural restraints are derived from C resolved 100 or 120 ms mixing times and N resolved 120 ms mixing time H H NOESY experiments.

NMR data sets are processed with the NMRPipe Delaglio et al. 1995 NMRPipe 6 3 277 293 . spectral analysis and NMRView Johnson B. A. 2004 278 313 352 software packages. Backbone and torsion angle restraints are computed from C chemical shifts using the program TALOS Cornilescu G. et al. 1999 13 3 289 302 . 3J coupling constants are measured from HMQC J experiments as previously described Kuboniwa H. et al. 1994 4 6 871 878 . Residual dipolar couplings RDCs are measured in the NMR sample buffer to which the filamentous phage Pf1 is added Bax A. Kontaxis et al. 2001 339 127 174 . NOE assignments are performed in automated mode with the CANDID module of the program CYANA 2.1.4 Guntert P. 2004 278 353 378 . Initial assignments are augmented by iterative rounds of manual and automated NOE assignment within CYANA and NMRView. Upon assignment of 99 of observable NOEs structures from CYANA are further refined with Xplor NIH 2.12 employing IVM dynamics adapted to incorporate pseudo potentials for 3J coupling constants secondary C chemical shifts and a conformational database potential for dihedral angles Schwieters et al. 2003 160 1 65 73 . Hydrogen bond distance restraints are incorporated for helical regions based on analysis of C secondary chemical shifts and characteristic H i NH i 3 i 4 NOEs. The 100 lowest energy structures having the best agreement with experimental restraints are subsequently refined in explicit solvent Spronk C. A. et al. 2002 22 3 281 289 to improve the local geometry electrostatics and packing quality of the protein. The final structure family is comprised of the 25 structures with the lowest energies for experimental restraints and the best overall values for chirality and stereochemistry measured with the programs WHATCHECK Hooft R. W. et al. 1996 381 6580 272 and PROCHECK NMR Laskowski R. A. et al. 1996 8 4 477 486 . 2002 Palo Alto Calif. USA PYMOL DeLano W. L. D. S. 2002 The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. Palo Alto Calif. USA and MOLMOL Koradi R. et al. 1996 14 1 51 55 29 32 .

Additional binding interactions between BH3 polypeptides and mimetics thereof and various BCL 2 family polypeptides are contemplated with the present invention. The present below method may also be adapted for assaying and optimizing binding interactions of BH3 polypeptides and mimetic chemical compounds with BCL 2 family polypeptides.

The expression and purification of H N BAX BAK BOK proteins can be performed as described in Example 2. For NMR titrations 1 1 complexes of BAX BAK BOK and SAHBs are generated by gradually increasing SAHB concentrations up to 0.5 mM in a 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 in DO or HO DO 9 1 . To identify a SAHB interaction site the chemical shift perturbations of backbone amides upon addition of SAHB peptide are followed on a series of H N HSQCs and data sets processed and chemical shifts measured with NMRPipe spectral analysis and NMRview software packages respectively. To define an overall conformational change of BAX BAK BOK backbone amides can be monitored and chemical shift assignments performed as described in Example 2. To facilitate the structure calculations for SAHB complexes H NMR 2D TOCSY and NOESY experiments provide solution structures for individual SAHB compounds that induce chemical shifts in BAX BAK BOK. Intermolecular NOEs are obtained from NOESY and 3D C edited C selected NOESY experiments performed on a sample of uniformly N C labeled BAX BAK BOK bound to unlabeled SAHB. In addition distance information for structural refinement of BAX BAK BOK SAHB complexes will be derived from HSQC experiments performed using SAHBs derivatized with lanthanide DOTA chelates positioned at selected sites Vlasie M. D. et al. 2007 13 6 1715 1723 Battiste J. L. et al. 2000 39 18 5355 5365 or using MTSL labeled SAHBs as described in Example 1 and demonstrated in .

For example the DOTA chelate attached to SAHB upon lanthanide activation enhances relaxation and line broadening of nearby H NMR resonances of BAX BAK BOK protein in a distance dependent manner up to 25 . Paramagnetic relaxation enhancement PRE measurements are translated to distance restraints as previously described Battiste J. L. et al. 2000 39 18 5355 5365 . Structure calculations of the SAHB protein complexes are performed as described in Examples 1 and 2. If the binding of SAHB results in no detectable intermolecular NOEs the structural models can be computed using HADDOCK v2.0 Dominguez C. et al. 2003 125 7 1731 1737 with the default parameters and a set of unambiguous and ambiguous restraints determined from N HSQC NMR studies.

Initially 500 structures of the complex are generated by rigid body docking of the individual structures. 100 of the lowest energy structures are subsequently refined in a semi flexible simulated annealing followed by a fully flexible refinement in explicit solvent. The 20 lowest energy structures resulting from refinement of the family in explicit solvent are analyzed with HADDOCK internal scripts for analysis of several quality factors such as restraint violations number of hydrogen bonds hydrophobic contacts root mean square deviation at the interface and the total energy over the flexible interface of the BAX BAK BOK SAHB interaction.

To determine changes in the motion of specific BAX BAK BOK structural regions upon SAHB binding relaxation analysis is performed by measuring T1 T2 and H N heteronuclear NOE data as previously described Farrow N. A. et al. 1994 33 19 5984 6003 . T1 longitudinal recovery delays are set to 11 65 150 246 363 523 758 and 1142 ms. T2 transverse recovery delays are set to 21.6 43.2 64.8 86.4 108.0 151.1 194.3 and 237.5 ms respectively. The repetition rate of the CPMG sequence is set to 550 s. The H N NOE is collected using a H saturation time of 3s. In each case the error is determined as the standard deviation of two T1 T2 and NOE experiments. The data can be analyzed using the software package NMRView Johnson B. A. 2004 278 313 352 .

The methodology described above can likewise be applied to analyze the structural basis of novel modulator interactions with anti apoptotic proteins such as BCL 2 and BCL X.

Comparative analysis of the side chain interactions of SAHB ligands with BAX BAK BOK will enable the design of further natural and non natural amino acid modifications into SAHB compounds to enhance binding affinities and evolve compound selectivities. Such structure activity relationships by NMR methodology Shuker S. B. et al. 1996 274 5292 1531 1534 has successfully facilitated the development of small molecules that discern among discrete subgroups of anti apoptotic proteins Oltersdorf T. et al. 2005 435 7042 677 681 Bruncko M. et al. 2007 50 4 641 662 Wendt M. D. et al. 2006 49 3 1165 1181 . Computer modeling and docking strategies as described above in Example 3 will be used to simulate the substitution of discrete natural and or non natural residues into SAHB compounds to identify opportunities to engage additional favorable contact points at the interaction surface. Conversely distinguishing complementary interactions may be disrupted in order to engineer a desired specificity profile into the SAHB compound. SAHBs designed based upon these structural analyses are synthesized and iterated through the battery of experiments outlined in the proceeding examples in order to achieve and validate the compound refinements.

The active forms of BAX BAK BOK and other BCL 2 family polypeptides are believed to involve hetero and homo dimerization based higher order structures. For example BAX and BAK oligomers have been identified within the mitochondrial membrane and are believed to participate in pore formation that releases essential apoptogenic factors from the mitochondria. Because the SAHBs described herein activate BAX to form such higher order and functional oligomers SAHBs can be used to generate such structures in solution or through crystallization in order to generate and structurally characterize the oligomer. Because the oligomer is functionally required to induce mitochondrial apoptosis activation or inhibition of such oligomeric pores would be therapeutically beneficial. By adding SAHB compounds to BCL 2 family polypeptides such as BAX over a gradient of ligand ratios and using a variety of salt and other conditions known in the art distinct BAX conformers and oligomers can be generated and stabilized for NMR analyses as described herein or using X ray crystallographic methods known in the art. For example using 0.5 1 4 1 BIM SAHB BAX solutions high purify BAX oligomer has been generated and isolated in high purity. Functional activation or inhibition of BAX or other BCL 2 family polypeptides can be assayed using a size exclusion chromatograpy based monitoring of monomer oligomer states as described below 6A7 antibody mediated recognition of activated BAX as described below liposomal assay as described below and previously reported Walensky et al. Mol Cell 24 2 199 210 2006 the monitoring of current passing through pores generated by BCL 2 family polypeptides on a lipid monolayer ref. VDAC and Bax ex J Biol Chem 2000 275 16 12321 Bax and Bcl 2 ex Science 1997 277 pg. 370 or mitochondrial cytochrome c release as described below and previously reported Walensky et al. 24 2 199 210 2006 . Alternatively the structural data can be used to design or screen for molecules as described above and known to the art that would enhance or block oligomerization and or pore activity and thereby modulate apoptosis through direct regulation of the BCL 2 family polypeptide oligomeric pore formation itself. For example generating SAHB analogs that a target the novel activation site with too high affinity e.g. myristoyl derivatives or that b combines this binding interaction with an added moiety that blocks BAX conformational change or blocks the BAX homo oligomerization site or that c utilizes an activation site binder in combined treatment with a distinct oligomerization site binder SAHB such as SAHBs modeled after the BAX helix 9 which binds to the hydrophobic groove formed by the confluence of BAX BH domains 1 2 and 3 would interfere with the BAX activation process and thereby inhibit BAX mediated mitochondrial apoptosis for therapeutic benefit. The methods to evaluate such individual and combined treatments include the SEC based liposomal cytochrome c release and lipid monolayer current monitoring assays indicated above. Indeed a myristoylated BID SAHB compound binds BAX with higher affinity than the unmyristolated compound and retains a similar degree of helical content blocks BID SAHB triggered BAX oligomerization and BAX mediated cytochrome c release.

The myristoylated derivatives were made by capping the peptide amino terminus with myristic acid using standard coupling conditions.

Activation of the BCL 2 family pro apoptotic polypeptides causes mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization MOMP and the release of key apoptogenic proteins including cytochrome c and Smac Diablo which lead to terminal caspase activation Green D. R. 2005 121 5 671 674 . The below assays can be used for assaying the ability of the various active site binding compounds or resultant BCL 2 polypeptide oligomers to modulate apoptosis.

Mitochondrial Release Assay In order to test activation inhibition of a BCL 2 family polypeptide interactions on mitochondrial apoptosis induction a cytochrome c release assay is used that employs mouse liver mitochondria from Bak mice or Alb creBaxBak mice added recombinant BCL 2 family polypeptide e.g. BAX BAK or BOK 50 nM with or without increasing doses of SAHBs 50 500 nM and an ELISA based read out of cytochrome c. Negative controls include recombinant protein alone compounds alone vehicle treatment point mutant SAHBs and blockade using anti apoptotic proteins such as BCL X C.

A BAK chimera in which the C terminus is replaced with that of the more soluble BAX C terminus is also contemplated. In yet another embodiment mitochondrial studies to assess BAK activation are performed on wild type mouse liver mitochondria that contain endogenous BAK but lack BAX and BOK. In another aspect mitochondrial studies to assess BOK activation are performed using recombinant BOK or mouse mitochondria that contain endogenous BOK but lack BAX and BAK i.e. using BAX BAK null mitochondria from Alb creBaxBak mice .

Liposomal Release Assay Another assay that can be used to determine modulation of the BCL 2 family polypeptide is a liposomal release assay that simulates the mitochondria but only includes the essential components for BAX BAK BOK induced release. Liposomes duplicating the lipid composition of the mitochondrial outer membrane contact sites OMCT vesicles Ardail D. et al. 1990 Biol Chem 265 31 18797 18802 Lutter M. et al. 2000 Nat Cell Biol 2 10 754 761 are made using a mixture of 1 palmitoyl 2 oleoyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine POPC 1 palmitoyl 2 oleoyl sn glycero 3 phosphoethanolamine POPE beef liver phosphatidylinositol PI cholesterol and cardiolipin Avanti Polar Lipids at a weight ratio of 41 22 9 8 20 as previously described Oh K. J. et al. 2005 280 1 753 767 . Large unilamellar vesicles LUVs with a diameter of 100 nm are prepared by the extrusion method Szoka F. et al. 1980 601 3 559 571 in 20 mM HEPES 150 mM KCl pH 7 entrapped with FITC labeled dextran 10 kD Sigma and purified by gel filtration as described Oh K. 2005 280 1 753 767 . Lipid concentration is determined by measuring vesicular phosphate content B ttcher C. J. F. et al. 1961 Anal Chim Acta 24 203 204 . The fluorescence dequenching assay is adapted from previous reports Kuwana T. et al. 2002 Cell 111 3 331 342 Terrones O. et al. 2004 279 29 30081 30091 . The release of FITC labeled dextran 10 kD from LUVs is monitored using a FluoroMax 2 spectrofluorometer SPEX in a thermostated 1 cm path length quartz cuvette with constant stirring at 37 C. Excitation and emission wavelengths are 488 and 525 nm respectively slits 2 nm . The extent of fluorescent marker release is quantified on a percentage basis according to the equation F F F F 100 where Fis the measured fluorescence of reagent treated LUV at time t Fis the average fluorescence of the LUV suspension for the initial 1 2 min before reagent addition and Fis the average fluorescence value of the final 1 2 min after complete disruption of LUVs by addition of Triton X 100 final concentration 0.66 mM . Experiments are performed using a lipid concentration of 10 g ml 15 nM BAX BAK BOK 25 200 nM SAHBs singly or in combination and BCL X C or other anti apoptotic blockade 100 800 nM .

Oligomerization assay BIM SAHB was added to a 200 L solution 20 mM Hepes KOH pH 7.2 7.4 150 mM KCl containing monomeric BAX 38 M at a ratio of 0.5 1 1 1 2 1 and 4 1 BIM SAHB BAX. The mixtures and a sample of BAX monomer alone were incubated at 22 for 15 minutes and then subjected to analysis by size exclusion chromatography SEC using an SD75 column. The chromatogram demonstrates the monomeric and oligomeric peaks at 11.5 min and 6.5 min respectively. Protein standards GE Healthcare were used to calibrate the molecular weights of gel filtration peaks. For time dependent analysis BIM SAHB was added to monomeric BAX at a ratio of 1 1 and the mixtures were analyzed by SEC after incubation for 30 60 and 90 minutes at 22 C. As a baseline for comparison Bax monomer alone was analyzed at time 0 and the above time points.

Conformational change assay BIM SAHB was added to a 20 L PBS solution containing monomeric BAX 9 M at a ratio of 0.5 1 1 1 2 1 and 4 1 BIM SAHB BAX. The mixtures 10 L and a BAX monomer sample 10 L were incubated at 22 for 15 minutes and then added to a 3 BSA in PBS solution 250 L containing 15 L of 6A7 anti BAX antibody for 1 hour incubation at 4 C. Additionally 1 L of each input sample 10 was mixed with 50 L of SDS sample buffer to measure baseline BAX levels across specimens. Preclarified SEPHAROSE beads 50 L were added to the BIM SAHB BAX and BAX monomer solutions for an additional 2 hour incubation at 4 C. The SEPHAROSE beads were spun down washed 3 times with 1 mL of 3 BSA in PBS solution resuspended in 50 L of SDS sample buffer and boiled at 95 C. for 2 minutes. Ten microliters each of inputs and immunoprecipitation samples were used for analysis. Samples were separated on 12 SDS PAGE Bis Tris gel blotted on a PVDF membrane and Western analysis performed using the rabbit polyclonal N20 anti BAX antibody Santa Cruz Biotechnology and chemiluminescence based detection PerkinElmer .

Cell based apoptosis studies Yet another approach for determining BCL 2 family polypeptide modulation is cell based studies. Compounds are screened against a panel of tumor cell lines representing multiple myeloma leukemia lymphoma sarcoma retinoblastoma and cancers of the breast prostate colon lung kidney thyroid and adrenal gland. Many such cell lines have been characterized by DNA microarray expression profiling Mitsiades C. S. et al. 2004 5 3 221 230 . Tumor cells in their appropriate media are plated in 96 well format and exposed to serial dilutions of compounds. The effect of compound treatment on cancer cell viability is measured at 12 48 hours by MTT assay performed according to the manufacturer s protocol Roche and quantitated by an ELISA microplate reader Biorad . ICvalues are determined by nonlinear regression analysis using Prism software Graphpad . Compounds that display inhibitory activity in this assay are then evaluated for specific apoptosis induction over time in the corresponding cancer cell by annexin V binding and FACS analysis. Cultured cancer cells 0.5 1 10 are incubated for 24 hours with compound at concentrations observed to be effective in MTT assays. Cells are then washed and stained with propidium iodide 0.5 g mL and FITC tagged annexin V according to the manufacturer s protocol BD Biosciences . Apoptosis induction is quantified by FACS and the data analyzed using FlowJo software Tree Star . To confirm that compounds are functioning via the genetic pathway of apoptosis inactive SAHB analogues generated by point mutation are employed as negative controls. In addition caspase inhibitors such as caspase 3 inhibitor Z DEVD FMK BD Biosciences are employed to determine that SAHB induced apoptosis is reversed by caspase inactivation. The goal of these cell based studies is to match specific compounds with susceptible cancer cell lines as a basis for investigating the mechanistic contribution of direct engagement of BAX BAK BOK in reactivating cancer cell apoptosis.

Real time physiologic read outs of SAHB effects on compound sensitive cancer cell lines could additionally include microscopic evaluation of mitochondrial morphology Scorrano L. et al. 2002 2 1 55 67 epifluorescence imaging of mitochondrial calcium uptake Scorrano L. et al. 2003 Science 300 5616 135 139 measurement of changes in mitochondrial respiration and transmembrane potential Li H. et al. 1998 osis. 94 4 491 501 Scorrano L. et al. 2002 2 1 55 67 tracking the localization of intracellular cytochrome c by indirect immunofluorescence Yin X. et al. 1999 400 6747 886 891 quantitation of cytochrome c release by cell fractionation and Western analysis Kim H. 2006 8 1348 1358 and or quantitation of effector caspase 3 activity using a fluorogenic substrate Wei M. C. et al. 2001 292 5517 727 730 .

To confirm the identity of in situ targets of action of SAHB compounds co immunoprecipitation studies using extracts from FITC SAHB treated cells can be performed. For example treatment of Jurkat cells with FITC BID SAHB followed by anti FITC immunoprecipitation from extracts identified interacting proteins BID SAHB and BAX by Western analysis Walensky et al. 2006 Mol Cell 24 199 210 and by mass spectrometry based identification of electrophoresed bands.

SAHBs such as BIM SAHB were converted to selective crosslinking reagents that target BCL 2 polypeptides such as BAX at the novel and other active sites. Initially a panel of FITC BAD BH3 compounds containing benzophenone Bpa moieties at discrete locations were generated . To determine if Bpa substitution disrupted apoptotic binding activity the compounds were subjected to FPA studies using GST BCL X C and complete retention of high affinity binding activity across the panel was observed. The capacity for covalent crosslinking upon exposure to 350 nm light was tested in vitro using GST BCL X C and 2 fold molar excess FITC BAD BH3. A crosslinked adduct of the appropriate molecular weight as detected by Coommassie stain and by fluorescence gel imaging was observed. The covalent capture of GST BCL X C by the derivatized BH3 was time dependent and achieved near saturation by 135 min. The correct mass of the FITC BAD BH3 GST BCL X C complex was confirmed by MALDI MS analysis of the reaction mixture. The corresponding FITC BAD SAHBcompound was also generated which also covalently trapped GST BCL X C but with strikingly more rapid kinetics than the unstapled FITC BAD BH3. Proteolysis of the crosslinked species followed by mass spectrometry based analysis identified the amino acid sequence of the GST BCL X C fragment that was targeted by FITC BAD SAHB.

To access the novel active site BIM BID and PUMA SAHBs were generated to contain photoactivatable crosslinkable moieties as described above . Indeed all BIM SAHB derivatizes generated targeted and covalently bound BAX upon 350 nm light exposure in a dose and time dependent fashion. In fact the identification of a doublet species that migrated just above the BAX monomeric molecular weight highlighted the existence of alternative binding modes and resultant differences in BAX migration upon exposure to these SAHB reagents. When the crosslinking experiment was performed with different ratios of BIM SAHB BAX the crosslinking and stabilization of a higher order BAX oligomer that contained the BIM SAHB compounds was captured emphasizing the utility of these intercalating BIM SAHB derivatives to access the novel active site and also capture the physiologic oligomers of BAX that result from its activation.

In order to capture and define SAHB activities within cells the derivatized SAHBs described above were applied to cultured cells and after timed incubation periods subjected to irradiation with 350 nm light for up to one hour on ice followed by cellular lysis and anti FITC immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed and analyzed by Coommassie and silver staining fluorescent gel imaging and Western blotting for apoptotic proteins. To confirm the specificity of the findings negative control experiments included 1 the corresponding FITC SAHB compound that lacks Bpa incorporation 2 non irradiated samples and 3 point mutant FITC SAHB Bpa compounds. Specific and discrete electropheresed bands were excised and subjected to identification by mass spectrometry. Immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed and analyzed by Coommassie and silver staining fluorescent gel imaging and Western blotting for apoptotic and other proteins.

To achieve a covalent complex retrieval strategy beyond anti FITC pull downs a multifunctional handle was chemically fused to SAHB compounds. The design included an initial capping of SAHBs with the alkyne containing carboxylic acid 4 pentynoic acid for use in the cell treatment in situ binding and irradiation steps. Upon cellular lysis subsequent to covalent capture the N terminal propargyl group of the crosslinked SAHB compound selectively undergoes cycloaddition with an azide containing multifunctional linker in the presence of copper i.e. click chemistry Saghatelian A. et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 101 27 10000 10005 2004 Rabuka D. et al. J Am Chem Soc 128 37 12078 12079 2006 Speers A. E. et al. J Am Chem Soc 125 16 4686 4687 2003 Speers A. E. et al. Chem Biol 11 4 535 546 2004 . In addition to the azide functionality the linker was designed to contain a biotin moiety for streptavidin capture a fluorophore for detection and a protease recognition site for mild release of attached SAHB protein complexes from the streptavidin beads for proteomic analysis Adam G. C. et al. Mol Cell Proteomics. 1 10 828 835 2002 . . The released fluorophore labeled SAHB protein complex was analyzed by MALDI MS and LC MS techniques to determine the molecular mass followed by digestion with trypsin or lysyl endopeptidase to produce fragments for protein identification using high resolution mass spectrometry. An added benefit of this method which complements the structural approaches defined above is the capability to identify the site of SAHB interaction on the target protein utilizing the fluorophore labeled fragment for sequence determination by tandem mass spectrometry MS MS or MSn analysis.

Thus in order to maximally exploit apoptotic pathways to subvert cancer and other diseases a careful dissection of how specific pro apoptotic agents reactivate cell death in cancer is required. Because of the synthetic challenges associated with incorporating a covalent capture moiety into a small molecule and the attendant risk of modifying the compound s activity as a result in situ mechanisms of action are rarely defined for small molecules in an explicit manner. An important advantage of cell permeable SAHBs is their facile derivatization with a broad range of chemical functionalities. In generating multifunctional SAHBs for covalent capture the intracellular targets of these apoptotic compounds are clearly defined and thereby how specific BH3 death domains and their pathways can be harnessed to reactivate or inhibit apoptosis for therapeutic purposes can be determined.

In another alternative strategy for converting SAHBs into crosslinkable reagents in situ involves derivatizing the amino termini with a photo labile carbene or nitrene generating functionality. First SAHBs were synthesized with amino terminal Ala linker sequences containing a biotinylated lysine residue for streptavidin affinity capture. The amino terminus was then capped via the carboxylate of p 3 trifluoromethyl diazirine 3 yl benzoic acid or the nitrene generating adduct 4 azido 2 3 5 6 tetrafluorobenzoic acid Yan M. et al. 5 2 151 157 1994 . Cancer or other cells exposed to the photolabile SAHBs were treated with either 30W black light for diazirine photolysis or UV illumination for azide photolysis followed by incubation cellular lysis and streptavidin bead based target capture of biotinylated SAHB protein complexes. Control experiments were performed in parallel using SAHB point mutants known to abrogate binding activity. Eluted SAHB protein complexes were resolved by denaturing gel electrophoresis and bands present in SAHB fractions but not in SAHB point mutant lanes subjected to protein identification by mass spectrometry analysis.

The knowledge gained from dissecting BAX BAK BOK regulation via the novel active site can be applied to develop targeted therapeutics for cancer and other diseases based on reactivating or inhibiting apoptosis through direct BAX BAK BOK engagement. To that end SAHBs with potent and specific BAX BAK BOK mediated pro apoptotic activity such as BIM SAHB have undergone therapeutic efficacy testing in vivo. For example reactivating apoptosis by BH3 replacement was tested.

To evaluate SAHB compound activity and selectivity BH3 replacement was performed in disease models that were derived from the elimination of the corresponding BH3 only protein s that activate BAX BAK BOK. For example the capacity of BIM SAHB to reactivate apoptosis in lymphoid infiltrates found in the organs of Bim mice was tested. Age and sex matched pilot cohorts of Bim and wild type mice were either treated with vehicle 2.5 DMSO D5W or BIM SAHB 10 mg kg daily for five to seven days followed by euthanasia tissue harvest histopathologic evaluation and immunohistochemical workup. Well defined B lineage lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates of the kidney lung and liver were examined. Whereas the histology of vehicle and BIM SAHB treated wild type animals was normal in both groups clear evidence of lymphoid infiltration was evident in the organs of Bim mice. Strikingly Bim mice treated with BIM SAHB displayed marked influx of tingible body macrophages in the lymphoid infiltrates. B220 cell fragments were evident within the macrophages by immunohistochemistry and scattered cells throughout the infiltrate were positive for activated caspase 3 TUNEL positivity was also observed. Organs from vehicle treated Bim mice lacked these findings suggesting that BIM SAHB initiated apoptosis of the pathologic infiltrates within Bim organs. To expand these studies irradiated 450 cGy female Rag2 gamma c mice 10 12 wk were reconstituted with 2 10bone marrow cells from Bim mice in order to generate large uniform cohorts n 10 for statistical analysis. The reconstituted animals develop the same autoimmune phenomena of the native Bim mice including the fatal glomerulosclerosis.

For example the study design included five cohorts treated 12 weeks post transplant with either vehicle BIM SAHB 3 10 mg kg or negative control SAHB e.g. mutant BIM SAHB or a distinct SAHB such as BAD SAHB 3 10 mg kg daily for 7 days. On days 0 4 and 7 of the study complete blood count FACS analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes serine BUN Creatinine and splenic and kidney ultrasound for organ volume and RF mode echogenicity measurements Vevo 770 VisualSonics were performed. On day 8 the animals were sacrificed for histopathologic and immunohistochemical analyses e.g. TUNEL and activated caspase 3 positive cells per high power field of renal infiltrates . Data on lymphocyte counts CBC lymphocyte subsets FACS renal function BUN Creatinine spleen and kidney volume ultrasound and RF mode backscatter spectra ultrasonic evidence of apoptosis were inspected and mathematically transformed if necessary to stabilize the variance across treatment groups. Repeated measures analysis of variance are used for the blood and imaging parameters measured on days 0 4 and 7 and contrasts within the model will be used to assess changes from baseline between treatment groups. Histopathologic analysis of organ infiltrates obtained for example on day 8 at sacrifice are assessed between groups using the Kruskal Wallis test for the three group comparison and the Wilcoxon rank sum test for comparisons of the BIM SAHB treated animals to controls. With 10 animals per group the Wilcoxon rank sum test has 80 power to detect a 1 standard deviation difference between groups testing at a one sided significance level of 0.10.

Based on the comparative analyses of Bim and Bim Bid phenotypes and their cellular apoptosis resistance profiles MEFs splenocytes thymocytes it is contemplated that combinatorial knock out models will provide distinct disease backgrounds for evaluating the efficacy of BID BIM and PUMA SAHBs singly and in combination. Additionally in reconstitution studies using bone marrows from single and combination BH3 only genotypes morphologically and immunophenotypically distinct lymphoproliferations were observed which also serve as genotype specific disease models for SAHB efficacy testing.

In yet another approach SAHB efficacy testing can also be performed using mouse xenograft models corresponding to particular SAHB sensitive cell lines. SAHB sensitive cancer cell lines of interest would be retrovirally transduced to achieve stable luciferase expression pMMP LucNeo as previously described Armstrong S. A. et al. 3 2 173 183 2003 . To screen for successful transfer and growth of transplanted tumor SCID beige mice 6 8 weeks old females Jackson Laboratory are subjected to 300 cGy total body irradiation Gammacell 40 Atomic Energy of Canada LTD and 3 hours later injected with the cancer cells by tail vein i.e. 0.5 10 1.0 10 2.5 10 or 5 10injected cells . For alternate day in vivo tumor imaging mice are anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane and treated concomitantly with intraperitoneal injection of D luciferin 60 mg kg . Photonic emission is imaged 2 min exposure using the Xenogen In Vivo Imaging System and total body bioluminescence quantified by integration of photonic flux photons sec using Xenogen s Living Image Software. The time course for cancer development is determined by monitoring for increasing bioluminescence and the diagnosis of cancer confirmed by necropsy of ill appearing animals. The optimal cell dose to achieve a robust xenograft is determined for each chosen cell line. For these longitudinal studies of 4 cell doses 7 animals would be studied per group. This experimental design assumes that the standard deviation of the mean luminescence levels between the dose groups is 70 of the standard deviation within the animals treated at a given dose level thereby affording 80 power to determine there was indeed a difference in luminescence testing at the overall 0.05 significance level. Statistical calculations for this experimental design were performed using nQueryAdvisor5.0.

Xenograft studies can examine 6 mouse cohorts n 10 treated with either vehicle alone low or high dose SAHB 3 30 mg kg or low or high dose SAHB mutant control. Starting on experimental day 1 ln total body luminescence range of 14 16 mice receive a once daily tail vein injection and then imaged on alternate days to track tumor growth and survival daily for the duration of the experiment. With 10 animals per group we have 80 power to distinguish between a control cohort in which 90 of the animals succumb to disease by a fixed time point compared to 30 in a treated group with testing at the 0.05 nominal significance level. The survival distributions of experimental mice are determined using the Kaplan Meier method and compared using the log rank test. The Fisher s exact test is used to compare the proportion of mice who fail treatment where treatment failure is defined as progression or death and success as stable disease or regression. Whole body necropsy with detailed histologic evaluation of the tumor sites of expired mice are performed. When a treatment response is observed with a particular SAHB the experiment is repeated using 10 mice cohorts dosed at different levels in order to evaluate dose response to treatment. Two additional cohorts treated with either vehicle or a therapeutic dose of SAHB are used for pharmacodynamic studies in which pro apoptotic activities are evaluated by euthanizing animals on specific treatment days and tumor tissue harvested for evaluation by TUNEL and activated caspase 3 immunohistochemical staining.

Many cancer cells and their relapsed chemoresistant variants achieve cellular immortality by massively overexpressing anti apoptotic members of the BCL 2 family. Using BH3 mimetics and small molecules anti apoptotic inhibition is one mode of overcoming apoptotic blockade. However when BH3 mimetics or small molecules have a specificity profile that cannot target a specific anti apoptotic blockade such as MCL 1 overexpression Van Delft et al Cancer Cell. 2006 Nov. 10 5 389 99 Konopleva et al Cancer Cell. 2006 Nov. 10 5 375 88 Deng et al Cancer Cell. 2007 Aug. 12 2 171 85 direct BAX modulation can circumvent or synergize with such apoptotic blockade for therapeutic benefit. Indeed BID and BIM SAHBs have the dual capability to directly bind and activate BAX BAK and block anti apoptotic targets and are thus more potent than other BH3 mimetics such as ABT 737 or BAD SAHB in reactivating apoptosis of MCL 1 overexpressing or otherwise chemoresistant cancer cells. For example the Pfeiffer lymphoma cell line which overexpresses MCL 1 and A1 is resistant to ABT 737 but is potently killed by BIM SAHB. Therefore cancers or other diseased cells that either overexpress anti apoptotic proteins such as MCL 1 and A1 or cancers or diseased cells that specifically down regulate activator BH3 only proteins like BIM such as in Mantle Cell lymphoma Tagawa et al Oncogene. 2005 Feb. 17 24 8 1348 58 Mestre Escorihuela Blood. 2007 Jan. 1 109 1 271 80 and cf. with mouse model of BIM deletion are ideally suited for BIM SAHB or derivatives and mimetics thereof to reactivate apoptosis through direct engagement of the novel BAX activation site and thereby induce apoptosis for therapeutic purposes and irrespective of the aforementioned apoptotic blockades.
