The present disclosure relates to methods of inhibiting cells that express the Fc gamma receptor CD32b Fc RIIb immunoglobulin compositions that may be useful for such methods and application of such compositions for treating immune disorders and hematological malignancies.

Antigen recognition by B cells is mediated by the B cell receptor BCR a surface bound immunoglobulin in complex with signaling components CD79a Ig and CD79b Ig . Crosslinking of BCR upon engagement of antigen results in phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motifs ITAMs within CD79a and CD79b initiating a cascade of intracellular signaling events that recruit downstream molecules to the membrane and stimulate calcium mobilization. This leads to the induction of diverse B cell responses e.g. cell survival proliferation antibody production antigen presentation differentiation etc. which lead to a humoral immune response DeFranco A. L. 1997 Curr. Opin. Immunol. 9 296 308 Pierce S. K. 2002 Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2 96 105 Ravetch J. V. Lanier L. L. 2000 Science 290 84 89 . Other components of the BCR coreceptor complex enhance e.g. CD19 CD21 and CD81 or suppress e.g. CD22 and CD72 BCR activation signals Doody G. M. et al. 1996 Curr. Opin. Immunol. 8 378 382 L1 D. H. et al. 2006 J. Immunol. 176 5321 5328 . In this way the immune system maintains multiple BCR regulatory mechanisms to ensure that B cell responses are tightly controlled.

When antibodies are produced to an antigen the circulating level of immune complexes e.g. antigen bound to antibody increases. These immune complexes downregulate antigen induced B cell activation. It is believed that these immune complexes downregulate antigen induced B cell activation by coengaging cognate BCR with the low affinity inhibitory receptor Fc RIIb the only IgG receptor on B cells Heyman B. 2003 Immunol. Lett. 88 157 161 . It is also believed that this negative feedback of antibody production requires interaction of the antibody Fc domain with Fc RIIb since immune complexes containing F ab antibody fragments are not inhibitory Chan P. L. Sinclair N. R. 1973 Immunology 24 289 301 . The intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibitory motif ITIM of Fc RIIb is necessary to inhibit BCR induced intracellular signals Amigorena S. et al. 1992 Science 256 1808 1812 Muta T. et al. 1994 Nature 368 70 73 . This inhibitory effect occurs through phosphorylation of the Fc RIIb ITIM which recruits SH2 containing inositol polyphosphate 5 phosphatase SHIP to neutralize ITAM induced intracellular calcium mobilization Kiener P. A. et al. 1997 J. Biol. Chem. 272 3838 3844 Ono M. et al. 1996 Nature 383 263 266 Ravetch J. V. Lanier L. L. 2000 Science 290 84 89 . In addition Fc RIIb mediated SHIP phosphorylation inhibits the downstream Ras MAPK proliferation pathway Tridandapani S. et al. 1998 Immunol. 35 1135 1146 .

The humoral immune response e.g. the result of diverse B cell responses may be initiated when B cells are activated by an antigen and subsequently differentiated into plasma cells. Binding of membrane bound B cell receptor BCR on B cells by an antigen activates an intracellular signaling cascade including calcium mobilization which leads to cell proliferation and differentiation. Coengagement of cognate BCR with the inhibitory Fc receptor Fc RIIb inhibits B cell activation signals through a negative feedback loop.

The importance of Fc RIIb in negative regulation of B cell responses has been demonstrated using Fc RIIb deficient mice which fail to regulate humoral responses Wernersson S. et al. 1999 J.

Described herein are antibodies that mimic the inhibitory effects of coengagement of cognate BCR with Fc RIIb on B cells. For example describe herein are variant anti CD19 antibodies engineered such that the Fc domain binds to Fc RIIb with up to 430 fold greater affinity. Relative to native IgG1 the Fc RIIb binding enhanced IIbE variants strongly inhibit BCR induced calcium mobilization and viability in primary human B cells. Inhibitory effects involved phosphorylation of SH2 containing inositol polyphosphate 5 phosphatase SHIP which is known to be involved in Fc RIIb induced negative feedback of B cell activation. Coengagement of BCR and Fc RIIb by IIbE variants also overcame the anti apoptotic effects of BCR activation. The use of a single antibody to suppress B cell functions by coengagement of cognate BCR and Fc RIIb may represent a novel approach in the treatment of B cell mediated diseases. Nonlimiting examples of B cell mediated diseases include hematological malignancies autoimmunity allergic responses etc.

As described herein an immunoglobulin may be an antibody an Fc fusion an isolated Fc an Fc fragment or an Fc polypeptide. In one embodiment an immunoglobulin is an antibody.

Antibodies are immunological proteins that bind a specific antigen. In most mammals including humans and mice antibodies are constructed from paired heavy and light polypeptide chains. The light and heavy chain variable regions show significant sequence diversity between antibodies and are responsible for binding the target antigen. Each chain is made up of individual immunoglobulin Ig domains and thus the generic term immunoglobulin is used for such proteins.

Traditional antibody structural units typically comprise a tetramer. Each tetramer is typically composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains each pair having one light typically having a molecular weight of about 25 kDa and one heavy chain typically having a molecular weight of about 50 70 kDa . Human light chains are classified as kappa and lambda light chains. Heavy chains are classified as mu delta gamma alpha or epsilon and define the antibody s isotype as IgM IgD IgG IgA and IgE respectively. IgG has several subclasses including but not limited to IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 and IgG4. IgM has subclasses including but not limited to IgM1 and IgM2. IgA has several subclasses including but not limited to IgA1 and IgA2. Thus isotype as used herein is meant any of the classes and subclasses of immunoglobulins defined by the chemical and antigenic characteristics of their constant regions. The known human immunoglobulin isotypes are IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgA1 IgA2 IgM1 IgM2 IgD and IgE.

Each of the light and heavy chains are made up of two distinct regions referred to as the variable and constant regions. The IgG heavy chain is composed of four immunoglobulin domains linked from N to C terminus in the order VH CH1 CH2 CH3 referring to the heavy chain variable domain heavy chain constant domain 1 heavy chain constant domain 2 and heavy chain constant domain 3 respectively also referred to as VH C 1 C 2 C 3 referring to the heavy chain variable domain constant gamma 1 domain constant gamma 2 domain and constant gamma 3 domain respectively . The IgG light chain is composed of two immunoglobulin domains linked from N to C terminus in the order VL CL referring to the light chain variable domain and the light chain constant domain respectively. The constant regions show less sequence diversity and are responsible for binding a number of natural proteins to elicit important biochemical events. The distinguishing features between these antibody classes are their constant regions although subtler differences may exist in the variable region.

The variable region of an antibody contains the antigen binding determinants of the molecule and thus determines the specificity of an antibody for its target antigen. The variable region is so named because it is the most distinct in sequence from other antibodies within the same class. The amino terminal portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. In the variable region three loops are gathered for each of the V domains of the heavy chain and light chain to form an antigen binding site. Each of the loops is referred to as a complementarity determining region hereinafter referred to as a CDR in which the variation in the amino acid sequence is most significant. There are 6 CDRs total three each per heavy and light chain designated VH CDR1 VH CDR2 VH CDR3 VL CDR1 VL CDR2 and VL CDR3. The variable region outside of the CDRs is referred to as the framework FR region. Although not as diverse as the CDRs sequence variability does occur in the FR region between different antibodies. Overall this characteristic architecture of antibodies provides a stable scaffold the FR region upon which substantial antigen binding diversity the CDRs can be explored by the immune system to obtain specificity for a broad array of antigens. A number of high resolution structures are available for a variety of variable region fragments from different organisms some unbound and some in complex with antigen. Sequence and structural features of antibody variable regions are disclosed for example in Morea et al. 1997 Biophys Chem 68 9 16 Morea et al. 2000 Methods 20 267 279 hereby entirely incorporated by reference and the conserved features of antibodies are disclosed for example in Maynard et al. 2000 Annu Rev Biomed Eng 2 339 376 hereby entirely incorporated by reference.

The carboxy terminal portion of each chain defines a constant region primarily responsible for effector function. In the IgG subclass of immunoglobulins there are several immunoglobulin domains in the heavy chain. By immunoglobulin Ig domain herein is meant a region of an immunoglobulin having a distinct tertiary structure. Of interest in embodiments described herein are the heavy chain domains including the constant heavy CH domains and the hinge region. In the context of IgG antibodies the IgG isotypes each have three CH regions. Accordingly CH domains in the context of IgG are as follows CH1 refers to positions 118 220 according to the EU index as in Kabat. CH2 refers to positions 237 340 according to the EU index as in Kabat and CH3 refers to positions 341 447 according to the EU index as in Kabat.

Another important region of the heavy chain is the hinge region. By hinge or hinge region or antibody hinge region or immunoglobulin hinge region herein is meant the flexible polypeptide comprising the amino acids between the first and second constant domains of an antibody. Structurally the IgG CH1 domain ends at EU position 220 and the IgG CH2 domain begins at residue EU position 237. Thus for IgG the antibody hinge is herein defined to include positions 221 D221 in IgG1 to 236 G236 in IgG1 wherein the numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat. In some embodiments for example in the context of an Fc region the lower hinge is included with the lower hinge generally referring to positions 226 or 230 to 236.

Of interest in embodiments described herein are the Fc regions. By Fc or Fc region as used herein is meant the polypeptide comprising the constant region of an antibody excluding the first constant region immunoglobulin domain and in some cases part of the hinge. Thus Fc refers to the last two constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgA IgD and IgG and the last three constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgE and IgM and the flexible hinge N terminal to these domains. For IgA and IgM Fc may include the J chain. For IgG Fc comprises immunoglobulin domains Cgamma2 and Cgamma3 C 2 and C 3 and the lower hinge region between Cgamma1 C 1 and Cgamma2 C 2 . Although the boundaries of the Fc region may vary the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to include residues C226 or P230 to its carboxyl terminus wherein the numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat. Fc may refer to this region in isolation or this region in the context of an Fc polypeptide as described below. By Fc polypeptide as used herein is meant a polypeptide that comprises all or part of an Fc region. Fc polypeptides include antibodies Fc fusions isolated Fcs and Fc fragments.

The Fc region of an antibody interacts with a number of Fc receptors and ligands imparting an array of important functional capabilities referred to as effector functions. For IgG the Fc region Fc comprises Ig domains C 2 and C 3 and the N terminal hinge leading into C 2. An important family of Fc receptors for the IgG class are the Fc gamma receptors Fc Rs . These receptors mediate communication between antibodies and the cellular arm of the immune system Raghavan et al. 1996 Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol 12 181 220 Ravetch et al. 2001 Annu Rev Immunol 19 275 290 both hereby entirely incorporated by reference . In humans this protein family includes Fc RI CD64 including isoforms Fc RIa Fc RIb and Fc RIc Fc RII CD32 including isoforms Fc RIIa including allotypes H131 and R131 Fc RIIb including Fc RIIb 1 and Fc RIIb 2 and Fc RIIc and Fc RIII CD16 including isoforms Fc RIIIa including allotypes V158 and F158 and Fc RIIIb including allotypes Fc RIIIb NA1 and Fc RIIIb NA2 Jefferis et al. 2002 Immunol Lett 82 57 65 hereby entirely incorporated by reference . These receptors typically have an extracellular domain that mediates binding to Fc a membrane spanning region and an intracellular domain that may mediate some signaling event within the cell. These receptors are expressed in a variety of immune cells including monocytes macrophages neutrophils dendritic cells eosinophils mast cells platelets B cells large granular lymphocytes Langerhans cells natural killer NK cells and T cells. Formation of the Fc Fc R complex recruits these effector cells to sites of bound antigen typically resulting in signaling events within the cells and important subsequent immune responses such as release of inflammation mediators B cell activation endocytosis phagocytosis and cytotoxic attack. The ability to mediate cytotoxic and phagocytic effector functions is a potential mechanism by which antibodies destroy targeted cells. The cell mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express Fc Rs recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell is referred to as antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC Raghavan et al. 1996 Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol 12 181 220 Ghetie et al. 2000 Annu Rev Immunol 18 739 766 Ravetch et al. 2001 Annu Rev Immunol 19 275 290 both hereby entirely incorporated by reference . The cell mediated reaction wherein nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express Fc Rs recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause phagocytosis of the target cell is referred to as antibody dependent cell mediated phagocytosis ADCP .

The different IgG subclasses have different affinities for the Fc Rs with IgG1 and IgG3 typically binding substantially better to the receptors than IgG2 and IgG4 Jefferis et al. 2002 Immunol Lett 82 57 65 hereby entirely incorporated by reference . The Fc Rs bind the IgG Fc region with different affinities. The extracellular domains of Fc RIIIa and Fc RIIIb are 96 identical however Fc RIIIb does not have a intracellular signaling domain. Furthermore whereas Fc RI Fc RIIa c and Fc RIIIa are positive regulators of immune complex triggered activation characterized by having an intracellular domain that has an immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif ITAM Fc RIIb has an immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibition motif ITIM and is therefore inhibitory. Thus the former are referred to as activation receptors and Fc RIIb is referred to as an inhibitory receptor. Despite these differences in affinities and activities all Fc Rs bind the same region on Fc at the N terminal end of the C 2 domain and the preceding hinge. This interaction is well characterized structurally Sondermann et al. 2001 J Mol Biol 309 737 749 hereby entirely incorporated by reference and several structures of the human Fc bound to the extracellular domain of human Fc RIIIb have been solved pdb accession code 1E4K Sondermann et al. 2000 Nature 406 267 273 hereby entirely incorporated by reference pdb accession codes 1IIS and 1IIX Radaev et al. 2001 J Biol Chem 276 16469 16477 hereby entirely incorporated by reference .

An overlapping but separate site on Fc serves as the interface for the complement protein C1q. In the same way that Fc Fc R binding mediates ADCC Fc C1q binding mediates complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC . A site on Fc between the C 2 and C 3 domains mediates interaction with the neonatal receptor FcRn the binding of which recycles endocytosed antibody from the endosome back to the bloodstream Raghavan et al. 1996 Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol 12 181 220 Ghetie et al. 2000 Annu Rev Immunol 18 739 766 both hereby entirely incorporated by reference . This process coupled with preclusion of kidney filtration due to the large size of the full length molecule results in favorable antibody serum half lives ranging from one to three weeks. Binding of Fc to FcRn also plays a key role in antibody transport. The binding site for FcRn on Fc is also the site at which the bacterial proteins A and G bind. The tight binding by these proteins is typically exploited as a means to purify antibodies by employing protein A or protein G affinity chromatography during protein purification. The fidelity of these regions the complement and FcRn protein A binding regions are important for both the clinical properties of antibodies and their development.

A key feature of the Fc region is the conserved N linked glycosylation that occurs at N297. This carbohydrate or oligosaccharide as it is sometimes referred plays a critical structural and functional role for the antibody and is one of the principle reasons that antibodies must be produced using mammalian expression systems. Efficient Fc binding to Fc R and C1q requires this modification and alterations in the composition of the N297 carbohydrate or its elimination affect binding to these proteins Umana et al. 1999 Nat Biotechnol 17 176 180 Davies et al. 2001 Biotechnol Bioeng 74 288 294 Mimura et al. 2001 J Biol Chem 276 45539 45547 Radaev et al. 2001 J Biol Chem 276 16478 16483 Shields et al. 2001 J Biol Chem 276 6591 6604 Shields et al. 2002 J Biol Chem 277 26733 26740 Simmons et al. 2002 J Immunol Methods 263 133 147 all hereby entirely incorporated by reference .

Immunoglobulins of embodiments described herein may also be an antibody like protein referred to as an Fc fusion Chamow et al. 1996 Trends Biotechnol 14 52 60 Ashkenazi et al. 19979 195 200 both incorporated entirely by reference . Fc fusion is herein meant to be synonymous with the terms immunoadhesin Ig fusion Ig chimera and receptor globulin sometimes with dashes as used in the prior art Chamow et al. 1996 Trends Biotechnol 14 52 60 Ashkenazi et al. 1997 Curr Opin Immunol 9 195 200 . An Fc fusion is a protein wherein one or more polypeptides herein referred to as a fusion partner is operably linked to Fc. An Fc fusion combines the Fc region of an antibody and thus its favorable effector functions and pharmacokinetics with the target binding region of a receptor ligand or some other protein or protein domain. The role of the latter is to mediate target recognition and thus it is functionally analogous to the antibody variable region. Because of the structural and functional overlap of Fc fusions with antibodies the discussion on antibodies in the present disclosure extends also to Fc fusions.

Virtually any protein or small molecule may be linked to Fc to generate an Fc fusion. Protein fusion partners may include but are not limited to the variable region of any antibody the target binding region of a receptor an adhesion molecule a ligand an enzyme a cytokine a chemokine or some other protein or protein domain. Small molecule fusion partners may include any agent that directs the Fc fusion to a target antigen. Such target antigen may be any molecule e.g. an extracellular receptor that is implicated in disease. Fc fusions of embodiments described herein may target virtually antigen that is expressed on CD32b cells.

Fusion partners may be linked to any region of an Fc region including at the N or C termini or at some residue in between the termini. In one embodiment a fusion partner is linked at the N or C terminus of the Fc region. A variety of linkers may find use in some embodiments described herein to covalently link Fc regions to a fusion partner. By linker linker sequence spacer tethering sequence or grammatical equivalents thereof herein is meant a molecule or group of molecules such as a monomer or polymer that connects two molecules and often serves to place the two molecules in a configuration. Linkers are known in the art for example homo or hetero bifunctional linkers as are well known see 1994 Pierce Chemical Company catalog technical section on cross linkers pages 155 200 incorporated entirely by reference . A number of strategies may be used to covalently link molecules together. These include but are not limited to polypeptide linkages between N and C termini of proteins or protein domains linkage via disulfide bonds and linkage via chemical cross linking reagents. In one aspect of this embodiment the linker is a peptide bond generated by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. The linker peptide may predominantly include the following amino acid residues Gly Ser Ala or Thr. The linker peptide should have a length that is adequate to link two molecules in such a way that they assume the correct conformation relative to one another so that they retain the desired activity. Suitable lengths for this purpose include at least one and not more than 50 amino acid residues. In one embodiment the linker is from about 1 to 30 amino acids in length. In one embodiment h linkers of 1 to 20 amino acids in length may be used. Useful linkers include glycine serine polymers including for example GS n GSGGS n set forth as SEQ ID NO 1 GGGGS n set forth as SEQ ID NO 2 and GGGS n set forth as SEQ ID NO 3 where n is an integer of at least one glycine alanine polymers alanine serine polymers and other flexible linkers as will be appreciated by those in the art. Alternatively a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers including but not limited to polyethylene glycol PEG polypropylene glycol polyoxyalkylenes or copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol may find use as linkers that is may find use to link an Fc regions to a fusion partner.

Also contemplated as fusion partners are Fc polypeptides. Thus an immunoglobulin as described herein may be a multimeric Fc polypeptide comprising two or more Fc regions. The advantage of such a molecule is that it provides multiple binding sites for Fc receptors with a single protein molecule. In one embodiment Fc regions may be linked using a chemical engineering approach. For example Fab s and Fc s may be linked by thioether bonds originating at cysteine residues in the hinges generating molecules such as FabFc. Fc regions may be linked using disulfide engineering and or chemical cross linking. In one embodiment Fc regions may be linked genetically. In one embodiment Fc regions in an immunoglobulin are linked genetically to generated tandemly linked Fc regions as described in U.S. Ser. No. 11 022 289 filed Dec. 21 2004 entitled Fc polypeptides with novel Fc ligand binding sites incorporated entirely by reference. Tandemly linked Fc polypeptides may comprise two or more Fc regions e.g. one to three Fc regions two Fc regions. It may be advantageous to explore a number of engineering constructs in order to obtain homo or hetero tandemly linked Fc regions with the most favorable structural and functional properties. Tandemly linked Fc regions may be homo tandemly linked Fc regions that is an Fc region of one isotype is fused genetically to another Fc region of the same isotype. It is anticipated that because there are multiple Fc R C1q and or FcRn binding sites on tandemly linked Fc polypeptides effector functions and or pharmacokinetics may be enhanced. In an alternate embodiment Fc regions from different isotypes may be tandemly linked referred to as hetero tandemly linked Fc regions. For example because of the capacity to target Fc R and FcaRI receptors an immunoglobulin that binds both Fc Rs and Fc RI may provide a significant clinical improvement.

In a certain embodiments the immunoglobulins disclosed herein may be substantially human.

As is well known in the art immunoglobulin polymorphisms exist in the human population. Gm polymorphism is determined by the IGHG1 IGHG2 and IGHG3 genes which have alleles encoding allotypic antigenic determinants referred to as G1m G2m and G3m allotypes for markers of the human IgG1 IgG2 and IgG3 molecules no Gm allotypes have been found on the gamma 4 chain . Markers may be classified into allotypes and isoallotypes . These are distinguished on different serological bases dependent upon the strong sequence homologies between isotypes. Allotypes are antigenic determinants specified by allelic forms of the Ig genes. Allotypes represent slight differences in the amino acid sequences of heavy or light chains of different individuals. Even a single amino acid difference can give rise to an allotypic determinant although in many cases there are several amino acid substitutions that have occurred. Allotypes are sequence differences between alleles of a subclass whereby the antisera recognize only the allelic differences. An isoallotype is an allele in one isotype which produces an epitope which is shared with a non polymorphic homologous region of one or more other isotypes and because of this the antisera will react with both the relevant allotypes and the relevant homologous isotypes Clark 1997 IgG effector mechanisms Chem.

The immunoglobulins disclosed herein may compose an Fc polypeptide including but not limited to antibodies isolated Fcs Fc fragments and Fc fusions. In one embodiment an immunoglobulin disclosed herein is a full length antibody constituting the natural biological form of an antibody including variable and constant regions. For the IgG isotype full length antibody is a tetramer and consists of two identical pairs of two immunoglobulin chains each pair having one light and one heavy chain each light chain comprising immunoglobulin domains VL and CL and each heavy chain comprising immunoglobulin domains VH C 1 C 2 and C 3. In another embodiment immunoglobulins disclosed herein are isolated Fc regions or Fc fragments.

Immunoglobulins disclosed herein may be a variety of structures including but not limited antibody fragments bispecific antibodies minibodies domain antibodies synthetic antibodies sometimes referred to herein as antibody mimetics chimeric antibodies humanized antibodies antibody fusions sometimes referred to as antibody conjugates and fragments of each respectively.

Specific antibody fragments include but are not limited to i the Fab fragment consisting of VL VH CL and CH1 domains ii the Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains iii the Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single antibody iv the dAb fragment which consists of a single variable v isolated CDR regions vi F ab 2 fragments a bivalent fragment comprising two linked Fab fragments vii single chain Fv molecules scFv wherein a VH domain and a VL domain are linked by a peptide linker which allows the two domains to associate to form an antigen binding site viii bispecific single chain Fv dimers and ix diabodies or triabodies multivalent or multispecific fragments constructed by gene fusion. The antibody fragments may be modified. For example the molecules may be stabilized by the incorporation of disulphide bridges linking the VH and VL domains. Examples of antibody formats and architectures are described in Holliger Hudson 2006 Nature Biotechnology 23 9 1126 1136 and Carter 2006 Nature Reviews Immunology 6 343 357 and references cited therein all expressly incorporated by reference.

In one embodiment an antibody disclosed herein may be a multispecific antibody and notably a bispecific antibody also sometimes referred to as diabodies . These are antibodies that bind to two or more different antigens. Diabodies can be manufactured in a variety of ways known in the art e.g. prepared chemically or from hybrid hybridomas. In one embodiment the antibody is a minibody. Minibodies are minimized antibody like proteins comprising a scFv joined to a CH3 domain. In some cases the scFv can be joined to the Fc region and may include some or all of the hinge region. For a description of multispecific antibodies see Holliger Hudson 2006 Nature Biotechnology 23 9 1126 1136 and references cited therein all expressly incorporated by reference.

The variable region of an antibody as is well known in the art can compose sequences from a variety of species. In some embodiments the antibody variable region can be from a nonhuman source including but not limited to mice rats rabbits camels llamas and monkeys. In some embodiments the scaffold components can be a mixture from different species. As such an antibody disclosed herein may be a chimeric antibody and or a humanized antibody. In general both chimeric antibodies and humanized antibodies refer to antibodies that combine regions from more than one species. For example chimeric antibodies traditionally comprise variable region s from a mouse or other nonhuman species and the constant region s from a human.

 Humanized antibodies generally refer to non human antibodies that have had the variable domain framework regions swapped for sequences found in human antibodies. Generally in a humanized antibody the entire antibody except the CDRs is encoded by a polynucleotide of human origin or is identical to such an antibody except within its CDRs. The CDRs some or all of which are encoded by nucleic acids originating in a non human organism are grafted into the beta sheet framework of a human antibody variable region to create an antibody the specificity of which is determined by the engrafted CDRs. The creation of such antibodies is described in e.g. WO 92 11018 Jones 1986 Nature 321 522 525 Verhoeyen et al. 1988 Science 239 1534 1536.

In one embodiment antigens are those that are expressed on CD32b cells e.g. B cell proteins e.g. one or more proteins of the B cell receptor complex. Target antigens include but are not limited to CD19 CD20 CD21 CR2 CD22 CD23 Fc RII Fc RI and subunits CD24 BBA 1 HSA CD27 CD35 CR1 CD38 CD40 CD45RA CD52 CAMPATH 1 HE5 CD72 CD79a Ig CD79b Ig IgM CD80 CD81 CD86 Leu13 HLA DR DP DQ CD138 CD317 HM1.24 CD11a CD11b CD11c CD14 CD68 CD163 CD172a CD200R and CD206. In one embodiment the immunoglobulins disclosed herein are also specific for a target antigen selected from the group consisting of IgM CD19 CD20 CD21 CD22 CD23 CD24 CD35 CD40 CD45RA CD72 CD79a CD79b CD80 CD81 CD86 and HLA DR. In one embodiment immunoglobulins disclosed herein are also specific for a target antigen selected from the group consisting of IgM CD79a CD79b CD19 CD21 CD22 CD72 CD81 and Leu13. In one embodiment immunoglobulins disclosed herein are also specific for a target antigen selected from the group consisting of CD19 CD79a Cd79b CD81 and HLA DR. In another embodiment immunoglobulins disclosed herein are also specific for a target antigen selected from the group consisting of CD22 CD40 and CD72.

In another embodiment target antigens may include those that are bound or may be bound to the surface of B cells. For example immunoglobulins disclosed herein may also target autoimmune antigens i.e. autoantigens or allergens. In one embodiment autoimmune antigens that may be targeted by the immunoglobulins disclosed herein include but are not limited to double stranded DNA platelet antigens myelin protein antigen Sm antigens in snRNPs islet cell antigen Rheumatoid factor and anticitrullinated protein. citrullinated proteins and peptides such as CCP 1 CCP 2 cyclical citrullinated peptides fibrinogen fibrin vimentin fillaggrin collagen I and II peptides alpha enolase translation initiation factor 4G1 perinuclear factor keratin Sa cytoskeletal protein vimentin components of articular cartilage such as collagen II IX and XI circulating serum proteins such as RFs IgG IgM fibrinogen plasminogen ferritin nuclear components such as RA33 hnRNP A2 Sm eukaryotic translation elogation factor 1 alpha 1 stress proteins such as HSP 65 70 90 BiP inflammatory immune factors such as B7 H1 IL 1 alpha and IL 8 enzymes such as calpastatin alpha enolase aldolase A dipeptidyl peptidase osteopontin glucose 6 phosphate isomerase receptors such as lipocortin 1 neutrophil nuclear proteins such as lactoferrin and 25 35 kD nuclear protein granular proteins such as bactericidal permeability increasing protein BPI elastase cathepsin G myeloperoxidase proteinase 3 platelet antigens myelin protein antigen islet cell antigen rheumatoid factor histones ribosomal P proteins cardiolipin vimentin nucleic acids such as dsDNA ssDNA and RNA ribonuclear particles and proteins such as Sm antigens including but not limited to SmD s and SmB B U1RNP A2 B1 hnRNP Ro SSA and La SSB antigens.

Immunoglobulins disclosed herein may comprise an Fc variant. An Fc variant comprises one or more amino acid modifications relative to a parent Fc polypeptide wherein the amino acid modification s provide one or more optimized properties. An Fc variant disclosed herein differs in amino acid sequence from its parent by virtue of at least one amino acid modification. Thus Fc variants disclosed herein have at least one amino acid modification compared to the parent. Alternatively the Fc variants disclosed herein may have more than one amino acid modification as compared to the parent for example from about one to fifty amino acid modifications e.g. from about one to ten amino acid modifications from about one to about five amino acid modifications etc. compared to the parent. Thus the sequences of the Fc variants and those of the parent Fc polypeptide are substantially homologous. For example the variant Fc variant sequences herein will possess about 80 homology with the parent Fc variant sequence e.g. at least about 90 homology at least about 95 homology at least about 98 homology at least about 99 homology etc. Modifications disclosed herein include amino acid modifications including insertions deletions and substitutions. Modifications disclosed herein also include glycoform modifications. Modifications may be made genetically using molecular biology or may be made enzymatically or chemically.

Fc variants disclosed herein are defined according to the amino acid modifications that compose them. Thus for example S267E is an Fc variant with the substitution S267E relative to the parent Fc polypeptide. Likewise S267E L328F defines an Fc variant with the substitutions S267E and L328F relative to the parent Fc polypeptide. The identity of the WT amino acid may be unspecified in which case the aforementioned variant is referred to as 267E 328F. It is noted that the order in which substitutions are provided is arbitrary that is to say that for example 267E 328F is the same Fc variant as 328F 267E and so on. Unless otherwise noted positions discussed herein are numbered according to the EU index or EU numbering scheme Kabat et al. 1991 Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest 5th Ed. United States Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda hereby entirely incorporated by reference . The EU index or EU index as in Kabat or EU numbering scheme refers to the numbering of the EU antibody Edelman et al. 1969 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 63 78 85 hereby entirely incorporated by reference .

In certain embodiments the Fc variants disclosed herein are based on human IgG sequences and thus human IgG sequences are used as the base sequences against which other sequences are compared including but not limited to sequences from other organisms for example rodent and primate sequences. Immunoglobulins may also comprise sequences from other immunoglobulin classes such as IgA IgE IgGD IgGM and the like. It is contemplated that although the Fc variants disclosed herein are engineered in the context of one parent IgG the variants may be engineered in or transferred to the context of another second parent IgG. This is done by determining the equivalent or corresponding residues and substitutions between the first and second IgG typically based on sequence or structural homology between the sequences of the first and second IgGs. In order to establish homology the amino acid sequence of a first IgG outlined herein is directly compared to the sequence of a second IgG. After aligning the sequences using one or more of the homology alignment programs known in the art for example using conserved residues as between species allowing for necessary insertions and deletions in order to maintain alignment i.e. avoiding the elimination of conserved residues through arbitrary deletion and insertion the residues equivalent to particular amino acids in the primary sequence of the first immunoglobulin are defined. Alignment of conserved residues may conserve 100 of such residues. However alignment of greater than 75 or as little as 50 of conserved residues is also adequate to define equivalent residues. Equivalent residues may also be defined by determining structural homology between a first and second IgG that is at the level of tertiary structure for IgGs whose structures have been determined. In this case equivalent residues are defined as those for which the atomic coordinates of two or more of the main chain atoms of a particular amino acid residue of the parent or precursor N on N CA on CA C on C and O on O are within about 0.13 nm after alignment. In another embodiment equivalent residues are within about 0.1 nm after alignment. Alignment is achieved after the best model has been oriented and positioned to give the maximum overlap of atomic coordinates of non hydrogen protein atoms of the proteins. Regardless of how equivalent or corresponding residues are determined and regardless of the identity of the parent IgG in which the IgGs are made what is meant to be conveyed is that the Fc variants discovered as disclosed herein may be engineered into any second parent IgG that has significant sequence or structural homology with the Fc variant. Thus for example if a variant antibody is generated wherein the parent antibody is human IgG1 by using the methods described above or other methods for determining equivalent residues the variant antibody may be engineered in another IgG1 parent antibody that binds a different antigen a human IgG2 parent antibody a human IgA parent antibody a mouse IgG2a or IgG2b parent antibody and the like. Again as described above the context of the parent Fc variant does not affect the ability to transfer the Fc variants disclosed herein to other parent IgGs.

The Fc variants disclosed herein may be optimized for a variety of Fc receptor binding properties. An Fc variant that is engineered or predicted to display one or more optimized properties is herein referred to as an optimized Fc variant . Properties that may be optimized include but are not limited to enhanced or reduced affinity for an Fc R. In one embodiment the Fc variants disclosed herein are optimized to possess enhanced affinity for an inhibitory receptor Fc RIIb. In other embodiments immunoglobulins disclosed herein provide enhanced affinity for Fc RIIb yet reduced affinity for one or more activating Fc Rs including for example Fc RI Fc RIIa Fc RIIIa and or Fc RIIIb. The Fc R receptors may be expressed on cells from any organism including but not limited to human cynomolgus monkeys and mice. The Fc variants disclosed herein may be optimized to possess enhanced affinity for human Fc RIIb.

By greater affinity or improved affinity or enhanced affinity or better affinity than a parent Fc polypeptide as used herein is meant that an Fc variant binds to an Fc receptor with a significantly higher equilibrium constant of association Kor Ka or lower equilibrium constant of dissociation Kor Kd than the parent Fc polypeptide when the amounts of variant and parent polypeptide in the binding assay are essentially the same. For example the Fc variant with improved Fc receptor binding affinity may display from about 5 fold to about 1000 fold e.g. from about 10 fold to about 500 fold improvement in Fc receptor binding affinity compared to the parent Fc polypeptide where Fc receptor binding affinity is determined for example by the binding methods disclosed herein including but not limited to Biacore by one skilled in the art. Accordingly by reduced affinity as compared to a parent Fc polypeptide as used herein is meant that an Fc variant binds an Fc receptor with significantly lower Kor higher Kthan the parent Fc polypeptide. Greater or reduced affinity can also be defined relative to an absolute level of affinity. For example according to the data herein WT native IgG1 binds Fc RIIb with an affinity of about 1.5 M or about 1500 nM. Furthermore some Fc variants described herein bind Fc RIIb with an affinity about 10 fold greater to WT IgG1. As disclosed herein greater or enhanced affinity means having a Klower than about 100 nM for example between about 10 nM about 100 nM between about 1 about 100 nM or less than about 1 nM.

In one embodiment the Fc variants provide selectively enhanced affinity to Fc RIIb relative to one or more activating receptors. Selectively enhanced affinity means either that the Fc variant has improved affinity for Fc RIIb relative to the activating receptor s as compared to the parent Fc polypeptide but has reduced affinity for the activating receptor s as compared to the parent Fc polypeptide or it means that the Fc variant has improved affinity for both Fc RIIb and activating receptor s as compared to the parent Fc polypeptide however the improvement in affinity is greater for Fc RIIb than it is for the activating receptor s . In alternate embodiments the Fc variants reduce or ablate binding to one or more activating Fc Rs reduce or ablate binding to one or more complement proteins reduce or ablate one or more Fc R mediated effector functions and or reduce or ablate one or more complement mediated effector functions.

The presence of different polymorphic forms of Fc Rs provides yet another parameter that impacts the therapeutic utility of the Fc variants disclosed herein. Whereas the specificity and selectivity of a given Fc variant for the different classes of Fc Rs significantly affects the capacity of an Fc variant to target a given antigen for treatment of a given disease the specificity or selectivity of an Fc variant for different polymorphic forms of these receptors may in part determine which research or pre clinical experiments may be appropriate for testing and ultimately which patient populations may or may not respond to treatment. Thus the specificity or selectivity of Fc variants disclosed herein to Fc receptor polymorphisms including but not limited to Fc RIIa Fc RIIIa and the like may be used to guide the selection of valid research and pre clinical experiments clinical trial design patient selection dosing dependence and or other aspects concerning clinical trials.

Fc variants disclosed herein may comprise modifications that modulate interaction with Fc receptors other than Fc Rs including but not limited to complement proteins FcRn and Fc receptor homologs FcRHs . FcRHs include but are not limited to FcRH1 FcRH2 FcRH3 FcRH4 FcRH5 and FcRH6 Davis et al. 2002 Immunol. Reviews 190 123 136 .

An important parameter that determines the most beneficial selectivity of a given Fc variant to treat a given disease is the context of the Fc variant. Thus the Fc receptor selectivity or specificity of a given Fc variant will provide different properties depending on whether it composes an antibody Fc fusion or Fc variants with a coupled fusion partner. In one embodiment an Fc receptor specificity of the Fc variant disclosed herein will determine its therapeutic utility. The utility of a given Fc variant for therapeutic purposes will depend on the epitope or form of the target antigen and the disease or indication being treated. For some targets and indications greater Fc RIIb affinity and reduced activating Fc R mediated effector functions may be beneficial. For other target antigens and therapeutic applications it may be beneficial to increase affinity for Fc RIIb or increase affinity for both Fc RIIb and activating receptors.

Target antigens of immunoglobulins disclosed herein may be expressed on a variety of cell types. In some embodiments immunoglobulins disclosed herein are specific for antigens expressed on CD32b cells. Cell types that may be targeted by the immunoglobulins disclosed herein include but are not limited to B cells plasma cells dendritic cells macrophages neutrophils mast cells basophils and eosinophils. In alternative embodiments the immunoglobulins disclosed herein may inhibit CD32b cells by targeting an antigen not expressed on CD32b cells. In some embodiments target antigens include those that are not expressed by CD32b cells but may be bound to CD32b cells e.g. via the BCR. For example in certain embodiments the immunoglobulins may target an autoimmune antigen or allergen. Autoimmune antigens that may be targeted by the immunoglobulins disclosed herein include but are not limited to citrullinated proteins and peptides such as CCP 1 CCP 2 cyclical citrullinated peptides fibrinogen fibrin vimentin fillaggrin collagen I and II peptides alpha enolase translation initiation factor 4G1 perinuclear factor keratin Sa cytoskeletal protein vimentin components of articular cartilage such as collagen II IX and XI circulating serum proteins such as RFs IgG IgM fibrinogen plasminogen ferritin nuclear components such as RA33 hnRNP A2 Sm eukaryotic translation elogation factor 1 alpha 1 stress proteins such as HSP 65 70 90 BiP inflammatory immune factors such as B7 H1 IL 1 alpha and IL 8 enzymes such as calpastatin alpha enolase aldolase A dipeptidyl peptidase osteopontin glucose 6 phosphate isomerase receptors such as lipocortin 1 neutrophil nuclear proteins such as lactoferrin and 25 35 kD nuclear protein granular proteins such as bactericidal permeability increasing protein BPI elastase cathepsin G myeloperoxidase proteinase 3 platelet antigens myelin protein antigen islet cell antigen rheumatoid factor histones ribosomal P proteins cardiolipin vimentin nucleic acids such as dsDNA ssDNA and RNA ribonuclear particles and proteins such as Sm antigens including but not limited to SmD s and SmB B U1RNP A2 B1 hnRNP Ro SSA and La SSB antigens.

Disclosed herein are methods of inhibiting CD32b cells. Without being limited thereto is a schematic representation of a proposed mechanism by which immunoglobulins disclosed herein inhibit CD32b cells See also Example 3 see also . Accordingly disclosed herein are methods of inhibiting CD32b cells comprising contacting a CD32b cell with an immunoglobulin comprising an Fc region with enhanced affinity to Fc RIIb. In one embodiment the immunoglobulin binds at least two B cell proteins e.g. at least to proteins bound to the surface B cells. In one embodiment the first of said B cell proteins is Fc RIIb. In a another embodiment the second of said B cell proteins is part of the B cell receptor BCR complex which may include an antigen bound to BCR. In another embodiment the second of said B cell proteins is not involved directly in antigen recognition. In another embodiment said the second of said B cell proteins is expressed on the surface of the B cell but is not part of the B cell receptor. Nonlimiting examples of the second of said B cell proteins include BCR proteins e.g. IgM CD79a CD79b CD19 CD21 CD22 CD72 CD81 Leu13 etc. antigens bound to the BCR e.g. autoantigens allergens etc. or other proteins bound to the surface of B cells e.g. CD20 CD23 CD24 CD35 CD40 CD45RA CD80 CD86 HLA DR etc. . In some embodiments the immunoglobulins inhibit release of calcium from the B cells upon their stimulation through the B cell receptor. In another embodiment an immunoglobulin disclosed herein binds at least two B cell proteins on the surface of the same B cell see e.g. .

Disclosed herein is directed to immunoglobulins comprising modifications wherein said modifications alter affinity to the Fc RIIb receptor and or alter the ability of the immunoglobulin to mediate one or more Fc RIIb mediated effector functions. Modifications of the invention include amino acid modifications and glycoform modifications.

As described herein see e.g. Example 9 simultaneous high affinity coengagement of cognate BCR and Fc RIIb may be used to inhibit Fc RIIb cells. Such coengagment may occur via the use of an immunoglobulin described herein e.g. an immunoglobulin used to coengage both Fc RIIb via its Fc region and a target antigen on the surface of the Fc RIIb cell e.g. one or more cognate BCR proteins and or an antigen bound to cognate BCR via its Fv region.

In some embodiments of the invention immunoglobulin may comprise means for isotypic modifications that is modifications in a parent IgG to the amino acid type in an alternate IgG. For example as illustrated in an IgG1 IgG3 hybrid variant may be constructed by a substitutional means for substituting IgG1 positions in the CH2 and or CH3 region with the amino acids from IgG3 at positions where the two isotypes differ. Thus a hybrid variant IgG antibody may be constructed that comprises one or more substitutional means e.g. 274Q 276K 300F 339T 356E 358M 384S 392N 397M 4221 435R and 436F. In other embodiments of the invention an IgG1 IgG2 hybrid variant may be constructed by a substitutional means for substituting IgG2 positions in the CH2 and or CH3 region with amino acids from IgG1 at positions where the two isotypes differ. Thus a hybrid variant IgG antibody may be constructed that comprises one or more substitutional means e.g. one or more of the following amino acid substations 233E 234L 235L 236G referring to an insertion of a glycine at position 236 and 327A.

Many polypeptides including antibodies are subjected to a variety of post translational modifications involving carbohydrate moieties such as glycosylation with oligosaccharides. There are several factors that can influence glycosylation. The species tissue and cell type have all been shown to be important in the way that glycosylation occurs. In addition the extracellular environment through altered culture conditions such as serum concentration may have a direct effect on glycosylation Lifely et al. 1995 Glycobiology 5 8 813 822 .

All antibodies contain carbohydrate at conserved positions in the constant regions of the heavy chain. Each antibody isotype has a distinct variety of N linked carbohydrate structures. Aside from the carbohydrate attached to the heavy chain up to 30 of human IgGs have a glycosylated Fab region. IgG has a single N linked biantennary carbohydrate at Asn297 of the CH2 domain. For IgG from either serum or produced ex vivo in hybridomas or engineered cells the IgG are heterogeneous with respect to the Asn297 linked carbohydrate Jefferis et al. 1998 Immunol. Rev. 163 59 76 Wright et al. 1997 Trends Biotech 15 26 32 . For human IgG the core oligosaccharide normally consists of GlcNAcManGlcNAc with differing numbers of outer residues.

The carbohydrate moieties of immunoglobulins disclosed herein will be described with reference to commonly used nomenclature for the description of oligosaccharides. A review of carbohydrate chemistry which uses this nomenclature is found in Hubbard et al. 1981 Ann. Rev. Biochem. 50 555 583. This nomenclature includes for instance Man which represents mannose GlcNAc which represents 2 N acetylglucosamine Gal which represents galactose Fuc for fucose and Glc which represents glucose. Sialic acids are described by the shorthand notation NeuNAc for 5 N acetylneuraminic acid and NeuNGc for 5 glycolylneuraminic.

The term glycosylation means the attachment of oligosaccharides carbohydrates containing two or more simple sugars linked together e.g. from two to about twelve simple sugars linked together to a glycoprotein. The oligosaccharide side chains are typically linked to the backbone of the glycoprotein through either N or O linkages. The oligosaccharides of immunoglobulins disclosed herein occur generally are attached to a CH2 domain of an Fc region as N linked oligosaccharides. N linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to an asparagine residue in a glycoprotein chain. The skilled artisan will recognize that for example each of murine IgG1 IgG2a IgG2b and IgG3 as well as human IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgA and IgD CH2 domains have a single site for N linked glycosylation at amino acid residue 297 Kabat et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest 1991 .

For the purposes herein a mature core carbohydrate structure refers to a processed core carbohydrate structure attached to an Fc region which generally consists of the following carbohydrate structure GlcNAc Fucose GlcNAc Man Man GlcNAc typical of biantennary oligosaccharides. The mature core carbohydrate structure is attached to the Fc region of the glycoprotein generally via N linkage to Asn297 of a CH2 domain of the Fc region. A bisecting GlcNAc is a GlcNAc residue attached to the 1 4 mannose of the mature core carbohydrate structure. The bisecting GlcNAc can be enzymatically attached to the mature core carbohydrate structure by a 1 4 N acetylglucosaminyltransferase III enzyme GnTIII . CHO cells do not normally express GnTIII Stanley et al. 1984 J. Biol. Chem. 261 13370 13378 but may be engineered to do so Umana et al. 1999 Nature Biotech. 17 176 180 .

Described herein are Fc variants that comprise modified glycoforms or engineered glycoforms. By modified glycoform or engineered glycoform as used herein is meant a carbohydrate composition that is covalently attached to a protein for example an antibody wherein said carbohydrate composition differs chemically from that of a parent protein. Engineered glycoforms may be useful for a variety of purposes including but not limited to enhancing or reducing Fc R mediated effector function. In one embodiment the immunoglobulins disclosed herein are modified to control the level of fucosylated and or bisecting oligosaccharides that are covalently attached to the Fc region.

A variety of methods are well known in the art for generating modified glycoforms Uma a et al. 1999 Nat Biotechnol 17 176 180 Davies et al. 2001 Biotechnol Bioeng 74 288 294 Shields et al. 2002 Biol Chem 277 26733 26740 Shinkawa et al. 2003 J Biol Chem 278 3466 3473 U.S. Pat. No. 6 602 684 U.S. Ser. No. 10 277 370 U.S. Ser. No. 10 113 929 PCT WO 00 61739A1 PCT WO 01 29246A1 PCT WO 02 31140A1 PCT WO 02 30954A1 Potelligent technology Biowa Inc. Princeton N.J. GlycoMAb glycosylation engineering technology GLYCART biotechnology AG Zurich Switzerland all of which are expressly incorporated by reference . These techniques control the level of fucosylated and or bisecting oligosaccharides that are covalently attached to the Fc region for example by expressing an IgG in various organisms or cell lines engineered or otherwise for example Lec 13 CHO cells or rat hybridoma YB2 0 cells by regulating enzymes involved in the glycosylation pathway for example FUT8 1 6 fucosyltranserase and or 1 4 N acetylglucosaminyltransferase III GnTIII or by modifying carbohydrate s after the IgG has been expressed. Other methods for modifying glycoforms of the immunoglobulins disclosed herein include using glycoengineered strains of yeast Li et al. 2006 Nature Biotechnology 24 2 210 215 moss Nechansky et al. 2007 Mol Immunjol 44 7 1826 8 and plants Cox et al. 2006 Nat Biotechnol 24 12 1591 7 . The use of a particular method to generate a modified glycoform is not meant to constrain embodiments to that method. Rather embodiments disclosed herein encompass Fc variants with modified glycoforms irrespective of how they are produced.

In one embodiment immunoglobulins disclosed herein are glycoengineered to alter the level of sialylation. Higher levels of sialylated Fc glycans in immunoglobulin G molecules can adversely impact functionality Scallon et al. 2007 Mol. Immunol. 44 7 1524 34 and differences in levels of Fc sialylation can result in modified anti inflammatory activity Kaneko et al. 2006 Science 313 670 673 . Because antibodies may acquire anti inflammatory properties upon sialylation of Fc core polysaccharide it may be advantageous to glycoengineer the immunoglobulins disclosed herein for greater or reduced Fc sialic acid content.

Engineered glycoform typically refers to the different carbohydrate or oligosaccharide thus for example an immuoglobulin may comprise an engineered glycoform. Alternatively engineered glycoform may refer to the immunoglobulin that comprises the different carbohydrate or oligosaccharide. In one embodiment a composition disclosed herein comprises a glycosylated Fc variant having an Fc region wherein about 51 100 of the glycosylated antibody e.g. 80 100 90 100 95 100 etc. of the antibody in the composition comprises a mature core carbohydrate structure which lacks fucose. In another embodiment the antibody in the composition both comprises a mature core carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose and additionally comprises at least one amino acid modification in the Fc region. In an alternative embodiment a composition comprises a glycosylated Fc variant having an Fc region wherein about 51 100 of the glycosylated antibody 80 100 or 90 100 of the antibody in the composition comprises a mature core carbohydrate structure which lacks sialic acid. In another embodiment the antibody in the composition both comprises a mature core carbohydrate structure that lacks sialic acid and additionally comprises at least one amino acid modification in the Fc region. In yet another embodiment a composition comprises a glycosylated Fc variant having an Fc region wherein about 51 100 of the glycosylated antibody 80 100 or 90 100 of the antibody in the composition comprises a mature core carbohydrate structure which contains sialic acid. In another embodiment the antibody in the composition both comprises a mature core carbohydrate structure that contains sialic acid and additionally comprises at least one amino acid modification in the Fc region. In another embodiment the combination of engineered glycoform and amino acid modification provides optimal Fc receptor binding properties to the antibody.

Immunoglobulins disclosed herein may comprise one or more modifications that provide optimized properties that are not specifically related to Fc R or complement mediated effector functions per se.

Disclosed herein are a variety of improvements that may be made by coupling the immunoglobulins disclosed herein with additional modifications.

In one embodiment the variable region of an antibody disclosed herein may be affinity matured that is to say that amino acid modifications have been made in the VH and or VL domains of the antibody to enhance binding of the antibody to its target antigen. Such types of modifications may improve the association and or the dissociation kinetics for binding to the target antigen. Other modifications include those that improve selectivity for target antigen vs. alternative targets. These include modifications that improve selectivity for antigen expressed on target vs. non target cells. Other improvements to the target recognition properties may be provided by additional modifications. Such properties may include but are not limited to specific kinetic properties i.e. association and dissociation kinetics selectivity for the particular target versus alternative targets and selectivity for a specific form of target versus alternative forms. Examples include full length versus splice variants cell surface vs. soluble forms selectivity for various polymorphic variants or selectivity for specific conformational forms of the target antigen. Immunoglobulins disclosed herein may comprise one or more modifications that provide reduced or enhanced internalization of an immunoglobulin.

In one embodiment modifications are made to improve biophysical properties of the immunoglobulins disclosed herein including but not limited to stability solubility and oligomeric state. Modifications can include for example substitutions that provide more favorable intramolecular interactions in the immunoglobulin such as to provide greater stability or substitution of exposed nonpolar amino acids with polar amino acids for higher solubility. A number of optimization goals and methods are described in U.S. Ser. No. 10 379 392 incorporated entirely by reference that may find use for engineering additional modifications to further optimize the immunoglobulins disclosed herein. The immunoglobulins disclosed herein can also be combined with additional modifications that reduce oligomeric state or size such that tumor penetration is enhanced or in vivo clearance rates are increased as desired.

Other modifications to the immunoglobulins disclosed herein include those that enable the specific formation or homodimeric or homomultimeric molecules. Such modifications include but are not limited to engineered disulfides as well as chemical modifications or aggregation methods which may provide a mechanism for generating covalent homodimeric or homomultimers. For example methods of engineering and compositions of such molecules are described in Kan et al. 20012001 166 1320 1326 Stevenson et al. 2002159 104 12 U.S. Pat. No. 5 681 566 Caron et al. 1992 J. Exp. Med. 176 1191 1195 and Shopes 1992 J. Immunol. 148 9 2918 22 all incorporated entirely by reference. Additional modifications to the variants disclosed herein include those that enable the specific formation or heterodimeric heteromultimeric bifunctional and or multifunctional molecules. Such modifications include but are not limited to one or more amino acid substitutions in the CH3 domain in which the substitutions reduce homodimer formation and increase heterodimer formation. For example methods of engineering and compositions of such molecules are described in Atwell et al. 1997 J. Mol. Biol. 270 1 26 35 and Carter et al. 2001 J. Immunol.

Covalent modifications of antibodies are included within the scope of immunoglobulins disclosed herein and are generally but not always done post translationally. For example several types of covalent modifications of the antibody are introduced into the molecule by reacting specific amino acid residues of the antibody with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N or C terminal residues.

In some embodiments the covalent modification of the antibodies disclosed herein comprises the addition of one or more labels. The term labeling group means any detectable label. In some embodiments the labeling group is coupled to the antibody via spacer arms of various lengths to reduce potential steric hindrance. Various methods for labeling proteins are known in the art and may be used in generating immunoglobulins disclosed herein. In general labels fall into a variety of classes depending on the assay in which they are to be detected a isotopic labels which may be radioactive or heavy isotopes b magnetic labels e.g. magnetic particles c redox active moieties d optical dyes enzymatic groups e.g. horseradish peroxidase galactosidase luciferase alkaline phosphatase e biotinylated groups and f predetermined polypeptide epitopes recognized by a secondary reporter e.g. leucine zipper pair sequences binding sites for secondary antibodies metal binding domains epitope tags etc. . In some embodiments the labeling group is coupled to the antibody via spacer arms of various lengths to reduce potential steric hindrance. Various methods for labeling proteins are known in the art and may be used in generating immunoglobulins disclosed herein. Specific labels include optical dyes including but not limited to chromophores phosphors and fluorophores with the latter being specific in many instances. Fluorophores can be either small molecule fluores or proteinaceous fluores. By fluorescent label is meant any molecule that may be detected via its inherent fluorescent properties.

In one embodiment the immunoglobulins disclosed herein are antibody fusion proteins sometimes referred to herein as antibody conjugates . The fusion partner or conjugate partner can be proteinaceous or non proteinaceous the latter generally being generated using functional groups on the antibody and on the conjugate partner. Conjugate and fusion partners may be any molecule including small molecule chemical compounds and polypeptides. For example a variety of antibody conjugates and methods are described in Trail et al. 1999 Curr. Opin. Immunol. 11 584 588 incorporated entirely by reference. Possible conjugate partners include but are not limited to cytokines cytotoxic agents toxins radioisotopes chemotherapeutic agent anti angiogenic agents a tyrosine kinase inhibitors and other therapeutically active agents. In some embodiments conjugate partners may be thought of more as payloads that is to say that the goal of a conjugate is targeted delivery of the conjugate partner to a targeted cell for example a cancer cell or immune cell by the immunoglobulin. Thus for example the conjugation of a toxin to an immunoglobulin targets the delivery of said toxin to cells expressing the target antigen. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art in reality the concepts and definitions of fusion and conjugate are overlapping. The designation of a fusion or conjugate is not meant to constrain it to any particular embodiment disclosed herein.

Conjugate partners may be linked to any region of an immunoglobulin disclosed herein including at the N or C termini or at some residue in between the termini. A variety of linkers may find use in immunoglobulins disclosed herein to covalently link conjugate partners to an immunoglobulin. By linker linker sequence spacer tethering sequence or grammatical equivalents thereof herein is meant a molecule or group of molecules such as a monomer or polymer that connects two molecules and often serves to place the two molecules in one configuration. Linkers are known in the art for example homo or hetero bifunctional linkers as are well known see 1994 Pierce Chemical Company catalog technical section on cross linkers pages 155 200 incorporated entirely by reference . A number of strategies may be used to covalently link molecules together. These include but are not limited to polypeptide linkages between N and C termini of proteins or protein domains linkage via disulfide bonds and linkage via chemical cross linking reagents. In one aspect of this embodiment the linker is a peptide bond generated by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. The linker peptide may predominantly include the following amino acid residues Gly Ser Ala or Thr. The linker peptide should have a length that is adequate to link two molecules in such a way that they assume the correct conformation relative to one another so that they retain the desired activity. Suitable lengths for this purpose include at least one and not more than 50 amino acid residues.

Also disclosed herein are methods for producing and experimentally testing immunoglobulins. The disclosed methods are not meant to constrain embodiments to any particular application or theory of operation. Rather the provided methods are meant to illustrate generally that one or more immunoglobulins may be produced and experimentally tested to obtain immunoglobulins. General methods for antibody molecular biology expression purification and screening are described in Antibody Engineering edited by Duebel Kontermann Springer Verlag Heidelberg 2001 and Hayhurst Georgiou 20015 683 689 Maynard Georgiou 20002 339 76 Antibodies A Laboratory Manual by Harlow Lane New York Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 1988 all incorporated entirely by reference.

In one embodiment disclosed herein nucleic acids are created that encode the immunoglobulins and that may then be cloned into host cells expressed and assayed if desired. Thus nucleic acids and particularly DNA may be made that encode each protein sequence. These practices are carried out using well known procedures. For example a variety of methods that may find use in generating immunoglobulins disclosed herein are described in Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual 3Ed. Maniatis Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press New York 2001 and Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons both incorporated entirely by reference. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the generation of exact sequences for a library comprising a large number of sequences is potentially expensive and time consuming. By library herein is meant a set of variants in any form including but not limited to a list of nucleic acid or amino acid sequences a list of nucleic acid or amino acid substitutions at variable positions a physical library comprising nucleic acids that encode the library sequences or a physical library comprising the variant proteins either in purified or unpurified form. Accordingly there are a variety of techniques that may be used to efficiently generate libraries disclosed herein. Such methods that may find use for generating immunoglobulins disclosed herein are described or referenced in U.S. Pat. No. 6 403 312 U.S. Ser. Nos. 09 782 004 09 927 790 10 218 102 PCT WO 01 40091 and PCT WO 02 25588 all incorporated entirely by reference. Such methods include but are not limited to gene assembly methods PCR based method and methods which use variations of PCR ligase chain reaction based methods pooled oligo methods such as those used in synthetic shuffling error prone amplification methods and methods which use oligos with random mutations classical site directed mutagenesis methods cassette mutagenesis and other amplification and gene synthesis methods. As is known in the art there are a variety of commercially available kits and methods for gene assembly mutagenesis vector subcloning and the like and such commercial products find use in for generating nucleic acids that encode immunoglobulins.

The immunoglobulins disclosed herein may be produced by culturing a host cell transformed with nucleic acid e.g. an expression vector containing nucleic acid encoding the immunoglobulins under the appropriate conditions to induce or cause expression of the protein. The conditions appropriate for expression will vary with the choice of the expression vector and the host cell and will be easily ascertained by one skilled in the art through routine experimentation. A wide variety of appropriate host cells may be used including but not limited to mammalian cells bacteria insect cells and yeast. For example a variety of cell lines that may find use in generating immunoglobulins disclosed herein are described in the ATCC cell line catalog available from the American Type Culture Collection.

In one embodiment the immunoglobulins are expressed in mammalian expression systems including systems in which the expression constructs are introduced into the mammalian cells using virus such as retrovirus or adenovirus. Any mammalian cells may be used e.g. human mouse rat hamster and primate cells. Suitable cells also include known research cells including but not limited to Jurkat T cells NIH3T3 CHO BHK COS HEK293 PER C.6 HeLa Sp2 0 NS0 cells and variants thereof. In an alternate embodiment library proteins are expressed in bacterial cells. Bacterial expression systems are well known in the art and include and . In alternate embodiments immunoglobulins are produced in insect cells e.g. Sf21 Sf9 Bti Tn5b1 4 or yeast cells e.g. etc . In an alternate embodiment immunoglobulins are expressed in vitro using cell free translation systems. In vitro translation systems derived from both prokaryotic e.g. and eukaryotic e.g. wheat germ rabbit reticulocytes cells are available and may be chosen based on the expression levels and functional properties of the protein of interest. For example as appreciated by those skilled in the art in vitro translation is required for some display technologies for example ribosome display. In addition the immunoglobulins may be produced by chemical synthesis methods. Also transgenic expression systems both animal e.g. cow sheep or goat milk embryonated hen s eggs whole insect larvae etc. and plant e.g. corn tobacco duckweed etc. 

The nucleic acids that encode the immunoglobulins disclosed herein may be incorporated into an expression vector in order to express the protein. A variety of expression vectors may be utilized for protein expression. Expression vectors may comprise self replicating extra chromosomal vectors or vectors which integrate into a host genome. Expression vectors are constructed to be compatible with the host cell type. Thus expression vectors which find use in generating immunoglobulins disclosed herein include but are not limited to those which enable protein expression in mammalian cells bacteria insect cells yeast and in in vitro systems. As is known in the art a variety of expression vectors are available commercially or otherwise that may find use for expressing immunoglobulins disclosed herein.

Expression vectors typically comprise a protein operably linked with control or regulatory sequences selectable markers any fusion partners and or additional elements. By operably linked herein is meant that the nucleic acid is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. Generally these expression vectors include transcriptional and translational regulatory nucleic acid operably linked to the nucleic acid encoding the immunoglobulin and are typically appropriate to the host cell used to express the protein. In general the transcriptional and translational regulatory sequences may include promoter sequences ribosomal binding sites transcriptional start and stop sequences translational start and stop sequences and enhancer or activator sequences. As is also known in the art expression vectors typically contain a selection gene or marker to allow the selection of transformed host cells containing the expression vector. Selection genes are well known in the art and will vary with the host cell used.

Immunoglobulins may be operably linked to a fusion partner to enable targeting of the expressed protein purification screening display and the like. Fusion partners may be linked to the immunoglobulin sequence via a linker sequences. The linker sequence will generally comprise a small number of amino acids typically less than ten although longer linkers may also be used. Typically linker sequences are selected to be flexible and resistant to degradation. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art any of a wide variety of sequences may be used as linkers. For example a common linker sequence comprises the amino acid sequence GGGGS. A fusion partner may be a targeting or signal sequence that directs immunoglobulin and any associated fusion partners to a desired cellular location or to the extracellular media. As is known in the art certain signaling sequences may target a protein to be either secreted into the growth media or into the periplasmic space located between the inner and outer membrane of the cell. A fusion partner may also be a sequence that encodes a peptide or protein that enables purification and or screening. Such fusion partners include but are not limited to polyhistidine tags His tags for example Hand Hor other tags for use with Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography IMAC systems e.g. Niaffinity columns GST fusions MBP fusions Strep tag the BSP biotinylation target sequence of the bacterial enzyme BirA and epitope tags which are targeted by antibodies for example c myc tags flag tags and the like . As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art such tags may be useful for purification for screening or both. For example an immunoglobulin may be purified using a His tag by immobilizing it to a Niaffinity column and then after purification the same His tag may be used to immobilize the antibody to a Nicoated plate to perform an ELISA or other binding assay as described below . A fusion partner may enable the use of a selection method to screen immunoglobulins see below . Fusion partners that enable a variety of selection methods are well known in the art. For example by fusing the members of an immunoglobulin library to the gene III protein phage display can be employed Kay et al. Phage display of peptides and proteins a laboratory manual Academic Press San Diego Calif. 1996 Lowman et al. 199130 10832 10838 Smith 1985228 1315 1317 incorporated entirely by reference . Fusion partners may enable immunoglobulins to be labeled. Alternatively a fusion partner may bind to a specific sequence on the expression vector enabling the fusion partner and associated immunoglobulin to be linked covalently or noncovalently with the nucleic acid that encodes them. The methods of introducing exogenous nucleic acid into host cells are well known in the art and will vary with the host cell used. Techniques include but are not limited to dextran mediated transfection calcium phosphate precipitation calcium chloride treatment polybrene mediated transfection protoplast fusion electroporation viral or phage infection encapsulation of the polynucleotide s in liposomes and direct microinjection of the DNA into nuclei. In the case of mammalian cells transfection may be either transient or stable.

In one embodiment immunoglobulins are purified or isolated after expression. Proteins may be isolated or purified in a variety of ways known to those skilled in the art. Standard purification methods include chromatographic techniques including ion exchange hydrophobic interaction affinity sizing or gel filtration and reversed phase carried out at atmospheric pressure or at high pressure using systems such as FPLC and HPLC. Purification methods also include electrophoretic immunological precipitation dialysis and chromatofocusing techniques. Ultrafiltration and diafiltration techniques in conjunction with protein concentration are also useful. As is well known in the art a variety of natural proteins bind Fc and antibodies and these proteins can find use for purification of immunoglobulins disclosed herein. For example the bacterial proteins A and G bind to the Fc region. Likewise the bacterial protein L binds to the Fab region of some antibodies as of course does the antibody s target antigen. Purification can often be enabled by a particular fusion partner. For example immunoglobulins may be purified using glutathione resin if a GST fusion is employed Niaffinity chromatography if a His tag is employed or immobilized anti flag antibody if a flag tag is used. For general guidance in suitable purification techniques see e.g. incorporated entirely by reference Protein Purification Principles and Practice 3Ed. Scopes Springer Verlag NY 1994 incorporated entirely by reference. The degree of purification necessary will vary depending on the screen or use of the immunoglobulins. In some instances no purification is necessary. For example in one embodiment if the immunoglobulins are secreted screening may take place directly from the media. As is well known in the art some methods of selection do not involve purification of proteins. Thus for example if a library of immunoglobulins is made into a phage display library protein purification may not be performed.

Immunoglobulins may be screened using a variety of methods including but not limited to those that use in vitro assays in vivo and cell based assays and selection technologies. Automation and high throughput screening technologies may be utilized in the screening procedures. Screening may employ the use of a fusion partner or label. The use of fusion partners has been discussed above. By labeled herein is meant that the immunoglobulins disclosed herein have one or more elements isotopes or chemical compounds attached to enable the detection in a screen. In general labels fall into three classes a immune labels which may be an epitope incorporated as a fusion partner that is recognized by an antibody b isotopic labels which may be radioactive or heavy isotopes and c small molecule labels which may include fluorescent and calorimetric dyes or molecules such as biotin that enable other labeling methods. Labels may be incorporated into the compound at any position and may be incorporated in vitro or in vivo during protein expression.

In one embodiment the functional and or biophysical properties of immunoglobulins are screened in an in vitro assay. In vitro assays may allow a broad dynamic range for screening properties of interest. Properties of immunoglobulins that may be screened include but are not limited to stability solubility and affinity for Fc ligands for example Fc Rs. Multiple properties may be screened simultaneously or individually. Proteins may be purified or unpurified depending on the requirements of the assay. In one embodiment the screen is a qualitative or quantitative binding assay for binding of immunoglobulins to a protein or nonprotein molecule that is known or thought to bind the immunoglobulin. In one embodiment the screen is a binding assay for measuring binding to the target antigen. In an alternate embodiment the screen is an assay for binding of immunoglobulins to an Fc ligand including but are not limited to the family of Fc Rs the neonatal receptor FcRn the complement protein C1q and the bacterial proteins A and G. Said Fc ligands may be from any organism. In one embodiment Fc ligands are from humans mice rats rabbits and or monkeys. Binding assays can be carried out using a variety of methods known in the art including but not limited to FRET Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer and BRET Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer based assays AlphaScreen Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay Scintillation Proximity Assay ELISA Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay SPR Surface Plasmon Resonance also known as BIACORE isothermal titration calorimetry differential scanning calorimetry gel electrophoresis and chromatography including gel filtration. These and other methods may take advantage of some fusion partner or label of the immunoglobulin. Assays may employ a variety of detection methods including but not limited to chromogenic fluorescent luminescent or isotopic labels.

The biophysical properties of immunoglobulins for example stability and solubility may be screened using a variety of methods known in the art. Protein stability may be determined by measuring the thermodynamic equilibrium between folded and unfolded states. For example immunoglobulins disclosed herein may be unfolded using chemical denaturant heat or pH and this transition may be monitored using methods including but not limited to circular dichroism spectroscopy fluorescence spectroscopy absorbance spectroscopy NMR spectroscopy calorimetry and proteolysis. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the kinetic parameters of the folding and unfolding transitions may also be monitored using these and other techniques. The solubility and overall structural integrity of an immunoglobulin may be quantitatively or qualitatively determined using a wide range of methods that are known in the art. Methods which may find use for characterizing the biophysical properties of immunoglobulins disclosed herein include gel electrophoresis isoelectric focusing capillary electrophoresis chromatography such as size exclusion chromatography ion exchange chromatography and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography peptide mapping oligosaccharide mapping mass spectrometry ultraviolet absorbance spectroscopy fluorescence spectroscopy circular dichroism spectroscopy isothermal titration calorimetry differential scanning calorimetry analytical ultra centrifugation dynamic light scattering proteolysis and cross linking turbidity measurement filter retardation assays immunological assays fluorescent dye binding assays protein staining assays microscopy and detection of aggregates via ELISA or other binding assay. Structural analysis employing X ray crystallographic techniques and NMR spectroscopy may also find use. In one embodiment stability and or solubility may be measured by determining the amount of protein solution after some defined period of time. In this assay the protein may or may not be exposed to some extreme condition for example elevated temperature low pH or the presence of denaturant. Because function typically requires a stable soluble and or well folded structured protein the aforementioned functional and binding assays also provide ways to perform such a measurement. For example a solution comprising an immunoglobulin could be assayed for its ability to bind target antigen then exposed to elevated temperature for one or more defined periods of time then assayed for antigen binding again. Because unfolded and aggregated protein is not expected to be capable of binding antigen the amount of activity remaining provides a measure of the immunoglobulin s stability and solubility.

In one embodiment the library is screened using one or more cell based or in vitro assays. For such assays immunoglobulins purified or unpurified are typically added exogenously such that cells are exposed to individual variants or groups of variants belonging to a library. These assays are typically but not always based on the biology of the ability of the immunoglobulin to bind to the target antigen and mediate some biochemical event for example effector functions like cellular lysis phagocytosis ligand receptor binding inhibition inhibition of growth and or proliferation apoptosis and the like. Such assays often involve monitoring the response of cells to immunoglobulin for example cell survival cell death cellular phagocytosis cell lysis change in cellular morphology or transcriptional activation such as cellular expression of a natural gene or reporter gene. For example such assays may measure the ability of immunoglobulins to elicit ADCC ADCP or CDC. For some assays additional cells or components that is in addition to the target cells may need to be added for example serum complement or effector cells such as peripheral blood monocytes PBMCs NK cells macrophages and the like. Such additional cells may be from any organism e.g. humans mice rat rabbit and monkey. Crosslinked or monomeric antibodies may cause apoptosis of certain cell lines expressing the antibody s target antigen or they may mediate attack on target cells by immune cells which have been added to the assay. Methods for monitoring cell death or viability are known in the art and include the use of dyes fluorophores immunochemical cytochemical and radioactive reagents. For example caspase assays or annexin flourconjugates may enable apoptosis to be measured and uptake or release of radioactive substrates e.g. Chromium 51 release assays or the metabolic reduction of fluorescent dyes such as alamar blue may enable cell growth proliferation or activation to be monitored. In one embodiment the DELFIA EuTDA based cytotoxicity assay Perkin Elmer Mass. is used. Alternatively dead or damaged target cells may be monitored by measuring the release of one or more natural intracellular proteins for example lactate dehydrogenase. Transcriptional activation may also serve as a method for assaying function in cell based assays. In this case response may be monitored by assaying for natural genes or proteins which may be upregulated or down regulated for example the release of certain interleukins may be measured or alternatively readout may be via a luciferase or GFP reporter construct. Cell based assays may also involve the measure of morphological changes of cells as a response to the presence of an immunoglobulin. Cell types for such assays may be prokaryotic or eukaryotic and a variety of cell lines that are known in the art may be employed. Alternatively cell based screens are performed using cells that have been transformed or transfected with nucleic acids encoding the immunoglobulins.

In vitro assays include but are not limited to binding assays ADCC CDC cytotoxicity proliferation peroxide ozone release chemotaxis of effector cells inhibition of such assays by reduced effector function antibodies ranges of activities such as 100 improvement or 100 reduction blends of receptor activation and the assay outcomes that are expected from such receptor profiles.

The biological properties of the immunoglobulins disclosed herein may be characterized in cell tissue and whole organism experiments. As is known in the art drugs are often tested in animals including but not limited to mice rats rabbits dogs cats pigs and monkeys in order to measure a drug s efficacy for treatment against a disease or disease model or to measure a drug s pharmacokinetics toxicity and other properties. Said animals may be referred to as disease models. With respect to the immunoglobulins disclosed herein a particular challenge arises when using animal models to evaluate the potential for in human efficacy of candidate polypeptides this is due at least in part to the fact that immunoglobulins that have a specific effect on the affinity for a human Fc receptor may not have a similar affinity effect with the orthologous animal receptor. These problems can be further exacerbated by the inevitable ambiguities associated with correct assignment of true orthologues Mechetina et al. 2002 54 463 468 incorporated entirely by reference and the fact that some orthologues simply do not exist in the animal e.g. humans possess an Fc RIIa whereas mice do not . Therapeutics are often tested in mice including but not limited to mouse strains NZB NOD BXSB MRL Ipr K BxN and transgenics including knockins and knockouts . Such mice can develop various autoimmune conditions that resemble human organ specific systemic autoimmune or inflammatory disease pathologies such as systemic lupus erythematosus SLE and rheumatoid arthritis RA . For example an immunoglobulin disclosed herein intended for autoimmune diseases may be tested in such mouse models by treating the mice to determine the ability of the immunoglobulin to reduce or inhibit the development of the disease pathology. Because of the incompatibility between the mouse and human Fc receptor system an alternative approach is to use a murine SCID model in which immune deficient mice are engrafted with human PBLs or PBMCs huPBL SCID huPBMC SCID providing a semi functional human immune system with human effector cells and Fc receptors. In such a model an antigen challenge such as tetanus toxoid activates the B cells to differentiate into plasma cells and secrete immunoglobulins thus reconstituting antigen specific humoral immunity. Therefore a dual targeting immunoglobulin disclosed herein that specifically binds to an antigen such as CD19 or CD79a b and Fc RIIb on B cells may be tested to examine the ability to specifically inhibit B cell differentiation. Such experimentation may provide meaningful data for determination of the potential of said immunoglobulin to be used as a therapeutic. Other organisms e.g. mammals may also be used for testing. For example because of their genetic similarity to humans monkeys can be suitable therapeutic models and thus may be used to test the efficacy toxicity pharmacokinetics or other property of the immunoglobulins disclosed herein. Tests of the immunoglobulins disclosed herein in humans are ultimately required for approval as drugs and thus of course these experiments are contemplated. Thus the immunoglobulins disclosed herein may be tested in humans to determine their therapeutic efficacy toxicity pharmacokinetics and or other clinical properties.

The immunoglobulins disclosed herein may confer superior performance on Fc containing therapeutics in animal models or in humans. The receptor binding profiles of such immunoglobulins as described in this specification may for example be selected to increase the potency of cytotoxic drugs or to target specific effector functions or effector cells to improve the selectivity of the drug s action. Further receptor binding profiles can be selected that may reduce some or all effector functions thereby reducing the side effects or toxicity of such Fc containing drug. For example an immunoglobulin with reduced binding to Fc RIIIa Fc RI and Fc RIIa can be selected to eliminate most cell mediated effector function or an immunoglobulin with reduced binding to C1q may be selected to limit complement mediated effector functions. In some contexts such effector functions are known to have potential toxic effects. Therefore eliminating them may increase the safety of the Fc bearing drug and such improved safety may be characterized in animal models. In some contexts such effector functions are known to mediate the desirable therapeutic activity. Therefore enhancing them may increase the activity or potency of the Fc bearing drug and such improved activity or potency may be characterized in animal models.

In some embodiments immunoglobulins disclosed herein may be assessed for efficacy in clinically relevant animal models of various human diseases. In many cases relevant models include various transgenic animals for specific antigens and receptors.

Relevant transgenic models such as those that express human Fc receptors e.g. CD32b could be used to evaluate and test immunoglobulins and Fc fusions in their efficacy. The evaluation of immunoglobulins by the introduction of human genes that directly or indirectly mediate effector function in mice or other rodents may enable physiological studies of efficacy in autoimmune disorders and RA. Human Fc receptors such as Fc RIIb may possess polymorphisms such as that in gene promoter 343 from G to C or transmembrane domain of the receptor 187 I or T which would further enable the introduction of specific and combinations of human polymorphisms into rodents. The various studies involving polymorphism specific FcRs is not limited to this section however encompasses all discussions and applications of FcRs in general as specified in throughout this application. Immunoglobulins disclosed herein may confer superior activity on Fc containing drugs in such transgenic models in particular variants with binding profiles optimized for human Fc RIIb mediated activity may show superior activity in transgenic CD32b mice. Similar improvements in efficacy in mice transgenic for the other human Fc receptors e.g. Fc RIIa Fc RI etc. may be observed for immunoglobulins with binding profiles optimized for the respective receptors. Mice transgenic for multiple human receptors would show improved activity for immunoglobulins with binding profiles optimized for the corresponding multiple receptors.

Because of the difficulties and ambiguities associated with using animal models to characterize the potential efficacy of candidate therapeutic antibodies in a human patient some variant polypeptides disclosed herein may find utility as proxies for assessing potential in human efficacy. Such proxy molecules may mimic in the animal system the FcR and or complement biology of a corresponding candidate human immunoglobulin. This mimicry is most likely to be manifested by relative association affinities between specific immunoglobulins and animal vs. human receptors. For example if one were using a mouse model to assess the potential in human efficacy of an Fc variant that has reduced affinity for the inhibitory human Fc RIIb an appropriate proxy variant would have reduced affinity for mouse Fc RII. It should also be noted that the proxy Fc variants could be created in the context of a human Fc variant an animal Fc variant or both.

In one embodiment the testing of immunoglobulins may include study of efficacy in primates e.g. cynomolgus monkey model to facilitate the evaluation of depletion of specific target cells harboring the target antigen. Additional primate models include but are not limited to use of the rhesus monkey to assess Fc polypeptides in therapeutic studies of autoimmune transplantation and cancer.

Toxicity studies are performed to determine antibody or Fc fusion related effects that cannot be evaluated in standard pharmacology profiles or occur only after repeated administration of the agent. Most toxicity tests are performed in two species a rodent and a non rodent to ensure that any unexpected adverse effects are not overlooked before new therapeutic entities are introduced into man. In general these models may measure a variety of toxicities including genotoxicity chronic toxicity immunogenicity reproductive developmental toxicity and carcinogenicity. Included within the aforementioned parameters are standard measurement of food consumption bodyweight antibody formation clinical chemistry and macro and microscopic examination of standard organs tissues e.g. cardiotoxicity . Additional parameters of measurement are injection site trauma and the measurement of neutralizing antibodies if any. Traditionally monoclonal antibody therapeutics naked or conjugated are evaluated for cross reactivity with normal tissues immunogenicity antibody production conjugate or linker toxicity and bystander toxicity of radiolabelled species. Nonetheless such studies may have to be individualized to address specific concerns and following the guidance set by ICH S6 Safety studies for biotechnological products also noted above . As such the general principles are that the products are sufficiently well characterized impurities contaminants have been removed that the test material is comparable throughout development that GLP compliance is maintained.

The pharmacokinetics PK of the immunoglobulins disclosed herein may be studied in a variety of animal systems with the most relevant being non human primates such as the cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys. Single or repeated i.v. s.c. administrations over a dose range of 6000 fold 0.05 300 mg kg can be evaluated for half life days to weeks using plasma concentration and clearance. Volume of distribution at a steady state and level of systemic absorbance can also be measured. Examples of such parameters of measurement generally include maximum observed plasma concentration Cmax the time to reach Cmax Tmax the area under the plasma concentration time curve from time 0 to infinity AUC 0 inf and apparent elimination half life T . Additional measured parameters could include compartmental analysis of concentration time data obtained following i.v. administration and bioavailability. Examples of pharmacological toxicological studies using cynomolgus monkeys have been established for Rituxan and Zevalin in which monoclonal antibodies to CD20 are cross reactive. Biodistribution dosimetry for radiolabelled antibodies and PK studies can also be done in rodent models. Such studies would evaluate tolerance at all doses administered toxicity to local tissues preferential localization to rodent xenograft animal models and depletion of target cells e.g. CD20 positive cells .

The immunoglobulins disclosed herein may confer superior pharmacokinetics on Fc containing therapeutics in animal systems or in humans. For example increased binding to FcRn may increase the half life and exposure of the Fc containing drug. Alternatively decreased binding to FcRn may decrease the half life and exposure of the Fc containing drug in cases where reduced exposure is favorable such as when such drug has side effects.

It is known in the art that the array of Fc receptors is differentially expressed on various immune cell types as well as in different tissues. Differential tissue distribution of Fc receptors may ultimately have an impact on the pharmacodynamic PD and pharmacokinetic PK properties of immunoglobulins disclosed herein. Because immunoglobulins of the presentation have varying affinities for the array of Fc receptors further screening of the polypeptides for PD and or PK properties may be extremely useful for defining the optimal balance of PD PK and therapeutic efficacy conferred by each candidate polypeptide.

Pharmacodynamic studies may include but are not limited to targeting specific cells or blocking signaling mechanisms measuring inhibition of antigen specific antibodies etc. The immunoglobulins disclosed herein may target particular effector cell populations and thereby direct Fc containing drugs to induce certain activities to improve potency or to increase penetration into a particularly favorable physiological compartment. For example neutrophil activity and localization can be targeted by an immunoglobulin that targets Fc RIIIb. Such pharmacodynamic effects may be demonstrated in animal models or in humans.

The immunoglobulins disclosed herein may find use in a wide range of products. In one embodiment an immunoglobulin disclosed herein is a therapeutic a diagnostic or a research reagent. The immunoglobulins may find use in a composition that is monoclonal or polyclonal. The immunoglobulins disclosed herein may be used for therapeutic purposes. As will be appreciated by those in the art the immunoglobulins disclosed herein may be used for any therapeutic purpose that antibodies and the like may be used for. The immunoglobulins may be administered to a patient to treat disorders including but not limited to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases infectious diseases and cancer.

A patient for the purposes disclosed herein includes both humans and other animals e.g. other mammals. Thus the immunoglobulins disclosed herein have both human therapy and veterinary applications. The term treatment or treating as disclosed herein is meant to include therapeutic treatment as well as prophylactic or suppressive measures for a disease or disorder. Thus for example successful administration of an immunoglobulin prior to onset of the disease results in treatment of the disease. As another example successful administration of an optimized immunoglobulin after clinical manifestation of the disease to combat the symptoms of the disease comprises treatment of the disease. Treatment and treating also encompasses administration of an optimized immunoglobulin after the appearance of the disease in order to eradicate the disease. Successful administration of an agent after onset and after clinical symptoms have developed with possible abatement of clinical symptoms and perhaps amelioration of the disease comprises treatment of the disease. Those in need of treatment include mammals already having the disease or disorder as well as those prone to having the disease or disorder including those in which the disease or disorder is to be prevented.

In one embodiment an immunoglobulin disclosed herein is administered to a patient having a disease involving inappropriate expression of a protein or other molecule. Within the scope disclosed herein this is meant to include diseases and disorders characterized by aberrant proteins due for example to alterations in the amount of a protein present protein localization posttranslational modification conformational state the presence of a mutant or pathogen protein etc. Similarly the disease or disorder may be characterized by alterations molecules including but not limited to polysaccharides and gangliosides. An overabundance may be due to any cause including but not limited to overexpression at the molecular level prolonged or accumulated appearance at the site of action or increased activity of a protein relative to normal. Included within this definition are diseases and disorders characterized by a reduction of a protein. This reduction may be due to any cause including but not limited to reduced expression at the molecular level shortened or reduced appearance at the site of action mutant forms of a protein or decreased activity of a protein relative to normal. Such an overabundance or reduction of a protein can be measured relative to normal expression appearance or activity of a protein and said measurement may play an important role in the development and or clinical testing of the immunoglobulins disclosed herein.

By cancer and cancerous herein refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. Examples of cancer include but are not limited to carcinoma lymphoma blastoma sarcoma including liposarcoma neuroendocrine tumors mesothelioma schwanoma meningioma adenocarcinoma melanoma and leukemia or lymphoid malignancies.

More particular examples of such cancers include hematologic malignancies such as Hodgkin s lymphoma non Hodgkin s lymphomas Burkitt s lymphoma small lymphocytic lymphoma chronic lymphocytic leukemia mycosis fungoides mantle cell lymphoma follicular lymphoma diffuse large B cell lymphoma marginal zone lymphoma hairy cell leukemia and lymphoplasmacytic leukemia tumors of lymphocyte precursor cells including B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia lymphoma and T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia lymphoma thymoma tumors of the mature T and NK cells including peripheral T cell leukemias adult T cell leukemia T cell lymphomas and large granular lymphocytic leukemia Langerhans cell histocytosis myeloid neoplasias such as acute myelogenous leukemias including AML with maturation AML without differentiation acute promyelocytic leukemia acute myelomonocytic leukemia and acute monocytic leukemias myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myeloproliferative disorders including chronic myelogenous leukemia tumors of the central nervous system such as glioma glioblastoma neuroblastoma astrocytoma medulloblastoma ependymoma and retinoblastoma solid tumors of the head and neck e.g. nasopharyngeal cancer salivary gland carcinoma and esophagael cancer lung e.g. small cell lung cancer non small cell lung cancer adenocarcinoma of the lung and squamous carcinoma of the lung digestive system e.g. gastric or stomach cancer including gastrointestinal cancer cancer of the bile duct or biliary tract colon cancer rectal cancer colorectal cancer and anal carcinoma reproductive system e.g. testicular penile or prostate cancer uterine vaginal vulval cervical ovarian and endometrial cancer skin e.g. melanoma basal cell carcinoma squamous cell cancer actinic keratosis liver e.g. liver cancer hepatic carcinoma hepatocellular cancer and hepatoma bone e.g. osteoclastoma and osteolytic bone cancers additional tissues and organs e.g. pancreatic cancer bladder cancer kidney or renal cancer thyroid cancer breast cancer cancer of the peritoneum and Kaposi s sarcoma and tumors of the vascular system e.g. angiosarcoma and hemagiopericytoma .

By autoimmune diseases herein include allogenic islet graft rejection alopecia greata ankylosing spondylitis antiphospholipid syndrome autoimmune Addison s disease antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies ANCA autoimmune diseases of the adrenal gland autoimmune hemolytic anemia autoimmune hepatitis autoimmune myocarditis autoimmune neutropenia autoimmune oophoritis and orchitis autoimmune thrombocytopenia autoimmune urticaria Behcet s disease bullous pemphigoid cardiomyopathy Castleman s syndrome celiac spruce dermatitis chronic fatigue immune disfunction syndrome chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy Churg Strauss syndrome cicatrical pemphigoid CREST syndrome cold agglutinin disease Crohn s disease dermatomyositis discoid lupus essential mixed cryoglobulinemia factor VIII deficiency fibromyalgia fibromyositis glomerulonephritis Grave s disease Guillain Barre Goodpasture s syndrome graft versus host disease GVHD Hashimoto s thyroiditis hemophilia A idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura ITP IgA neuropathy IgM polyneuropathies immune mediated thrombocytopenia juvenile arthritis Kawasaki s disease lichen plantus lupus erthematosis Meniere s disease mixed connective tissue disease multiple sclerosis type 1 diabetes mellitus myasthenia gravis pemphigus vulgaris pernicious anemia polyarteritis nodosa polychrondritis polyglandular syndromes polymyalgia rheumatica polymyositis and dermatomyositis primary agammaglobinulinemia primary biliary cirrhosis psoriasis psoriatic arthritis Reynauld s phenomenon Reiter s syndrome rheumatoid arthritis sarcoidosis scleroderma Sjorgen s syndrome solid organ transplant rejection stiff man syndrome systemic lupus erythematosus takayasu arteritis temporal arteristis giant cell arteritis thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura ulcerative colitis uveitis vasculitides such as dermatitis herpetiformis vasculitis vitiligo and Wegner s granulomatosis.

By inflammatory disorders herein include acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS acute septic arthritis adjuvant arthritis Prakken et al. Springer Semin Immunopathol. 2003 August 25 1 47 63 incorporated entirely by reference juvenile idiopathic arthritis de Kleer et al. Arthritis Rheum. 2003 July 47 7 2001 10 incorporated entirely by reference allergic encephalomyelitis allergic rhinitis allergic vasculitis allergy asthma atherosclerosis chronic inflammation due to chronic bacterial or viral infectionis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD coronary artery disease encephalitis inflammatory bowel disease inflammatory osteolysis inflammation associated with acute and delayed hypersensitivity reactions inflammation associated with tumors peripheral nerve injury or demyelinating diseases inflammation associated with tissue trauma such as burns and ischemia inflammation due to meningitis multiple organ injury syndrome pulmonary fibrosis sepsis and septic shock Stevens Johnson syndrome undifferentiated arthropy and undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy.

Some autoimmune and inflammatory diseases that may be targeted by the immunoglobulins disclosed herein include Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Rheumatoid arthritis Sjogren s syndrome Multiple sclerosis Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura ITP Graves disease Inflammatory bowel disease Psoriasis Type I diabetes and Asthma.

Immunoglobulins disclosed herein may be utilized to modulate the activity of the immune system and in some cases to mimic the effects of IVIg therapy in a more controlled specific and efficient manner. Thus immunoglobulins disclosed herein may be used as immunomodulatory therapeutics. IVIg is effectively a high dose of immunoglobulins delivered intravenously. In general IVIg has been used to downregulate autoimmune conditions. It has been hypothesized that the therapeutic mechanism of action of IVIg involves ligation of Fc receptors at high frequency J. Bayry et al. 2003 Transfusion Clinique et Biologique 10 165 169 Binstadt et al. 2003 J. Allergy Clin. Immunol 697 704 . Indeed animal models of thrombocytopenia purpura ITP show that the isolated Fc are the active portion of IVIg Samuelsson et al 2001 Pediatric Research 50 5 551 . For use in therapy immunoglobulin s are harvested from thousands of donors with all of the concomitant problems associated with non recombinant biotherapeutics collected from humans. An immunoglobulin disclosed herein should serve all of the roles of IVIg while being manufactured as a recombinant protein rather than harvested from donors.

The immunomodulatory effects of IVIg may be dependent on productive interaction with one or more Fc ligands including but not limited to Fc Rs complement proteins and FcRn. In some embodiments immunoglobulins disclosed herein may be used to promote anti inflammatory activity Samuelsson et al. 2001291 484 486 and or to reduce autoimmunity Hogarth 200214 798 802 . In one embodiment Fc variants that provide enhanced binding to the inhibitory receptor Fc RIIb provide an enhancement to the IVIg therapeutic approach. Such Fc variants would thus function as Fc RIIb agonists and would be expected to enhance the beneficial effects of IVIg as an autoimmune disease therapeutic and also as a modulator of B cell proliferation. In addition such Fc RIIb enhanced Fc variants may also be further modified to have the same or limited binding to other receptors. In additional embodiments the Fc variants with enhanced Fc RIIb affinity may be combined with mutations that reduce or ablate to other receptors thereby potentially further minimizing side effects during therapeutic use.

Binding to or blocking Fc receptors on immune system cells may be used to influence immune response in immunological conditions including but not limited to idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura ITP and rheumatoid arthritis RA among others. By use of the affinity enhanced Fc variants disclosed herein the dosages required in typical IVIg applications may be reduced while obtaining a substantially similar therapeutic effect. Binding enhancements to Fc RIIb would increase expression or inhibitory activity as needed of that receptor and improve efficacy. In addition modulated affinity of the Fc variants for activating Fc Rs FcRn and or also complement may also provide benefits.

Such immunomodulatory applications of the immunoglobulins disclosed herein may also be utilized in the treatment of oncological indications especially those for which therapy involves antibody dependant cytotoxic mechanisms. For example an Fc variant that enhances affinity to Fc RIIb may be used to antagonize this inhibitory receptor for example by binding to the Fc Fc RIIb binding site but failing to trigger or reducing cell signaling potentially enhancing the effect of antibody based anti cancer therapy. Such Fc variants functioning as Fc RIIb antagonists may either block the inhibitory properties of Fc RIIb or induce its inhibitory function as in the case of IVIg. An Fc RIIb antagonist may be used as co therapy in combination with any other therapeutic including but not limited to antibodies acting on the basis of ADCC related cytotoxicity. Fc RIIb antagonistic Fc variants of this type may be isolated Fc or Fc fragments although in alternate embodiments immunoglobulins may be used.

By infectious diseases herein include diseases caused by pathogens such as viruses bacteria fungi protozoa and parasites. Infectious diseases may be caused by viruses including adenovirus cytomegalovirus dengue Epstein Barr hanta hepatitis A hepatitis B hepatitis C herpes simplex type I herpes simplex type II human immunodeficiency virus HIV human papilloma virus HPV influenza measles mumps papova virus polio respiratory syncytial virus rinderpest rhinovirus rotavirus rubella SARS virus smallpox viral meningitis and the like. Infections diseases may also be caused by bacteria including and the like. Infectious diseases may also be caused by fungi such as and the like. Infectious diseases may also be caused by protozoa and parasites such as kokzidioa malaria and the like.

Furthermore antibodies disclosed herein may be used to prevent or treat additional conditions including but not limited to heart conditions such as congestive heart failure CHF myocarditis and other conditions of the myocardium skin conditions such as rosecea acne and eczema bone and tooth conditions such as bone loss osteoporosis Paget s disease Langerhans cell histiocytosis periodontal disease disuse osteopenia osteomalacia monostotic fibrous dysplasia polyostotic fibrous dysplasia bone metastasis bone pain management humoral malignant hypercalcemia periodontal reconstruction spinal cord injury and bone fractures metabolic conditions such as Gaucher s disease endocrine conditions such as Cushing s syndrome and neurological conditions.

A number of the receptors that may interact with the immunoglobulins disclosed herein are polymorphic in the human population. For a given patient or population of patients the efficacy of the immunoglobulins disclosed herein may be affected by the presence or absence of specific polymorphisms in proteins. For example Fc RIIIa is polymorphic at position 158 which is commonly either V high affinity or F low affinity . Patients with the V V homozygous genotype are observed to have a better clinical response to treatment with the anti CD20 antibody Rituxan rituximab likely because these patients mount a stronger NK response Dall Ozzo et. al. 2004 Cancer Res. 64 4664 9 incorporated entirely by reference . Additional polymorphisms include but are not limited to Fc RIIa R131 or H131 and such polymorphisms are known to either increase or decrease Fc binding and subsequent biological activity depending on the polymorphism. immunoglobulins disclosed herein may bind preferentially to a particular polymorphic form of a receptor for example Fc RIIa 158 V or to bind with equivalent affinity to all of the polymorphisms at a particular position in the receptor for example both the 158V and 158F polymorphisms of Fc RIIIa. In one embodiment immunoglobulins disclosed herein may have equivalent binding to polymorphisms may be used in an antibody to eliminate the differential efficacy seen in patients with different polymorphisms. Such a property may give greater consistency in therapeutic response and reduce non responding patient populations. Such variant Fc with identical binding to receptor polymorphisms may have increased biological activity such as ADCC CDC or circulating half life or alternatively decreased activity via modulation of the binding to the relevant Fc receptors. In one embodiment immunoglobulins disclosed herein may bind with higher or lower affinity to one of the polymorphisms of a receptor either accentuating the existing difference in binding or reversing the difference. Such a property may allow creation of therapeutics particularly tailored for efficacy with a patient population possessing such polymorphism. For example a patient population possessing a polymorphism with a higher affinity for an inhibitory receptor such as Fc RIIb could receive a drug containing an Fc variant with reduced binding to such polymorphic form of the receptor creating a more efficacious drug.

In one embodiment patients are screened for one or more polymorphisms in order to predict the efficacy of the immunoglobulins disclosed herein. This information may be used for example to select patients to include or exclude from clinical trials or post approval to provide guidance to physicians and patients regarding appropriate dosages and treatment options. For example in patients that are homozygous or heterozygous for Fc RIIIa 158F antibody drugs such as the anti CD20 mAb Rituximab are minimially effective Carton 2002 Blood 99 754 758 Weng 2003 J. Clin. Oncol. 21 3940 3947 both incorporated entirely by reference such patients may show a much better clinical response to the antibodies disclosed herein. In one embodiment patients are selected for inclusion in clinical trials for an immunoglobulin disclosed herein if their genotype indicates that they are likely to respond significantly better to an immunoglobulin disclosed herein as compared to one or more currently used immunoglobulin therapeutics. In another embodiment appropriate dosages and treatment regimens are determined using such genotype information. In another embodiment patients are selected for inclusion in a clinical trial or for receipt of therapy post approval based on their polymorphism genotype where such therapy contains an immunoglobulin engineered to be specifically efficacious for such population or alternatively where such therapy contains an Fc variant that does not show differential activity to the different forms of the polymorphism.

Also disclosed are diagnostic tests to identify patients who are likely to show a favorable clinical response to an immunoglobulin disclosed herein or who are likely to exhibit a significantly better response when treated with an immunoglobulin disclosed herein versus one or more currently used immunoglobulin therapeutics. Any of a number of methods for determining Fc R polymorphisms in humans known in the art may be used.

Furthermore also disclosed are prognostic tests performed on clinical samples such as blood and tissue samples. Such tests may assay for effector function activity including but not limited to ADCC CDC phagocytosis and opsonization or for killing regardless of mechanism of cancerous or otherwise pathogenic cells. In one embodiment ADCC assays such as those described previously are used to predict for a specific patient the efficacy of a given immunoglobulin disclosed herein. Such information may be used to identify patients for inclusion or exclusion in clinical trials or to inform decisions regarding appropriate dosages and treatment regemins. Such information may also be used to select a drug that contains a particular immunoglobulin that shows superior activity in such assay.

Pharmaceutical compositions are contemplated wherein an immunoglobulin disclosed herein and one or more therapeutically active agents are formulated. Formulations of the immunoglobulins disclosed herein are prepared for storage by mixing said immunoglobulin having the desired degree of purity with optional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition Osol A.

In one embodiment the pharmaceutical composition that comprises the immunoglobulin disclosed herein may be in a water soluble form such as being present as pharmaceutically acceptable salts which is meant to include both acid and base addition salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt refers to those salts that retain the biological effectiveness of the free bases and that are not biologically or otherwise undesirable formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid hydrobromic acid sulfuric acid nitric acid phosphoric acid and the like and organic acids such as acetic acid propionic acid glycolic acid pyruvic acid oxalic acid maleic acid malonic acid succinic acid fumaric acid tartaric acid citric acid benzoic acid cinnamic acid mandelic acid methanesulfonic acid ethanesulfonic acid p toluenesulfonic acid salicylic acid and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts include those derived from inorganic bases such as sodium potassium lithium ammonium calcium magnesium iron zinc copper manganese aluminum salts and the like. Some embodiments include at least one of the ammonium potassium sodium calcium and magnesium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non toxic bases include salts of primary secondary and tertiary amines substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins such as isopropylamine trimethylamine diethylamine triethylamine tripropylamine and ethanolamine. The formulations to be used for in vivo administration may be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes or other methods.

The immunoglobulins disclosed herein may also be formulated as immunoliposomes. A liposome is a small vesicle comprising various types of lipids phospholipids and or surfactant that is useful for delivery of a therapeutic agent to a mammal. Liposomes containing the immunoglobulin are prepared by methods known in the art such as described in Epstein et al. 198582 3688 Hwang et al. 198077 4030 U.S. Pat. No. 4 485 045 U.S. Pat.

The immunoglobulin and other therapeutically active agents may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared by methods including but not limited to coacervation techniques interfacial polymerization for example using hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin microcapsules or poly methylmethacylate microcapsules colloidal drug delivery systems for example liposomes albumin microspheres microemulsions nano particles and nanocapsules and macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition Osol A. Ed. 1980 incorporated entirely by reference. Sustained release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymer which matrices are in the form of shaped articles e.g. films or microcapsules. Examples of sustained release matrices include polyesters hydrogels for example poly 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate or poly vinylalcohol polylactides U.S. Pat. No. 3 773 919 incorporated entirely by reference copolymers of L glutamic acid and gamma ethyl L glutamate non degradable ethylene vinyl acetate degradable lactic acid glycolic acid copolymers such as the Lupron Depot which are injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate poly D 3 hydroxybutyric acid and ProLease commercially available from Alkermes which is a microsphere based delivery system composed of the desired bioactive molecule incorporated into a matrix of poly DL lactide co glycolide PLG .

Administration of the pharmaceutical composition comprising an immunoglobulin disclosed herein e.g. in the form of a sterile aqueous solution may be done in a variety of ways including but not limited to orally subcutaneously intravenously intranasally intraotically transdermally topically e.g. gels salves lotions creams etc. intraperitoneally intramuscularly intrapulmonary vaginally parenterally rectally or intraocularly. In some instances for example for the treatment of wounds inflammation etc. the immunoglobulin may be directly applied as a solution or spray. As is known in the art the pharmaceutical composition may be formulated accordingly depending upon the manner of introduction.

Subcutaneous administration may be used in circumstances where the patient may self administer the pharmaceutical composition. Many protein therapeutics are not sufficiently potent to allow for formulation of a therapeutically effective dose in the maximum acceptable volume for subcutaneous administration. This problem may be addressed in part by the use of protein formulations comprising arginine HCl histidine and polysorbate see WO 04091658 incorporated entirely by reference . Antibodies disclosed herein may be more amenable to subcutaneous administration due to for example increased potency improved serum half life or enhanced solubility.

As is known in the art protein therapeutics are often delivered by IV infusion or bolus. The antibodies disclosed herein may also be delivered using such methods. For example administration may be by intravenous infusion with 0.9 sodium chloride as an infusion vehicle.

Pulmonary delivery may be accomplished using an inhaler or nebulizer and a formulation comprising an aerosolizing agent. For example AERx inhalable technology commercially available from Aradigm or Inhance pulmonary delivery system commercially available from Nektar Therapeutics may be used. Antibodies disclosed herein may be more amenable to intrapulmonary delivery. FcRn is present in the lung and may promote transport from the lung to the bloodstream e.g. Syntonix WO 04004798 Bitonti et al. 2004 Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 101 9763 8 both incorporated entirely by reference . Accordingly antibodies that bind FcRn more effectively in the lung or that are released more efficiently in the bloodstream may have improved bioavailability following intrapulmonary administration. Antibodies disclosed herein may also be more amenable to intrapulmonary administration due to for example improved solubility or altered isoelectric point.

Furthermore immunoglobulins disclosed herein may be more amenable to oral delivery due to for example improved stability at gastric pH and increased resistance to proteolysis. Furthermore FcRn appears to be expressed in the intestinal epithelia of adults Dickinson et al. 1999 J. Clin. Invest. 104 903 11 incorporated entirely by reference so antibodies disclosed herein with improved FcRn interaction profiles may show enhanced bioavailability following oral administration. FcRn mediated transport of antibodies may also occur at other mucus membranes such as those in the gastrointestinal respiratory and genital tracts Yoshida et al. 2004 Immunity 20 769 83 incorporated entirely by reference .

In addition any of a number of delivery systems are known in the art and may be used to administer the antibodies disclosed herein. Examples include but are not limited to encapsulation in liposomes microparticles microspheres e.g. PLA PGA microspheres and the like. Alternatively an implant of a porous non porous or gelatinous material including membranes or fibers may be used. Sustained release systems may comprise a polymeric material or matrix such as polyesters hydrogels poly vinylalcohol polylactides copolymers of L glutamic acid and ethyl L gutamate ethylene vinyl acetate lactic acid glycolic acid copolymers such as the Lupron Depot and poly D 3 hydroxyburyric acid. It is also possible to administer a nucleic acid encoding an immunoglobulin disclosed herein for example by retroviral infection direct injection or coating with lipids cell surface receptors or other transfection agents. In all cases controlled release systems may be used to release the immunoglobulin at or close to the desired location of action.

The dosing amounts and frequencies of administration are in one embodiment selected to be therapeutically or prophylactically effective. As is known in the art adjustments for protein degradation systemic versus localized delivery and rate of new protease synthesis as well as the age body weight general health sex diet time of administration drug interaction and the severity of the condition may be necessary and will be ascertainable with routine experimentation by those skilled in the art.

The concentration of the therapeutically active immunoglobulin in the formulation may vary from about 0.1 to 100 weight . In one embodiment the concentration of the immunoglobulin is in the range of 0.003 to 1.0 molar. In order to treat a patient a therapeutically effective dose of the immunoglobulin disclosed herein may be administered. By therapeutically effective dose herein is meant a dose that produces the effects for which it is administered. The exact dose will depend on the purpose of the treatment and will be ascertainable by one skilled in the art using known techniques. Dosages may range from 0.0001 to 100 mg kg of body weight or greater for example 0.1 1 10 or 50 mg kg of body weight. In one embodiment dosages range from 1 to 10 mg kg.

In some embodiments only a single dose of the immunoglobulin is used. In other embodiments multiple doses of the immunoglobulin are administered. The elapsed time between administrations may be less than 1 hour about 1 hour about 1 2 hours about 2 3 hours about 3 4 hours about 6 hours about 12 hours about 24 hours about 48 hours about 2 4 days about 4 6 days about 1 week about 2 weeks or more than 2 weeks.

In other embodiments the antibodies disclosed herein are administered in metronomic dosing regimes either by continuous infusion or frequent administration without extended rest periods. Such metronomic administration may involve dosing at constant intervals without rest periods. Typically such regimens encompass chronic low dose or continuous infusion for an extended period of time for example 1 2 days 1 2 weeks 1 2 months or up to 6 months or more. The use of lower doses may minimize side effects and the need for rest periods.

In certain embodiments the immunoglobulin disclosed herein and one or more other prophylactic or therapeutic agents are cyclically administered to the patient. Cycling therapy involves administration of a first agent at one time a second agent at a second time optionally additional agents at additional times optionally a rest period and then repeating this sequence of administration one or more times. The number of cycles is typically from 2 10. Cycling therapy may reduce the development of resistance to one or more agents may minimize side effects or may improve treatment efficacy.

The antibodies disclosed herein may be administered concomitantly with one or more other therapeutic regimens or agents. The additional therapeutic regimes or agents may be used to improve the efficacy or safety of the immunoglobulin.

Fc RIIb is expressed on a variety of immune cells including B cells plasma cells dendritic cells monocytes and macrophages where it plays a critical role in immune regulation. In its normal role on B cells Fc RIIb serves as a feedback mechanism to modulate B cell activation through the B cell receptor BCR . Engagement of B cell antigen receptor BCR by immune complexed antigen on mature B cells activates an intracellular signaling cascade including calcium mobilization which leads to cell proliferation and differentiation. However as IgG antibodies with specificity to the antigen are produced the associated immune complexes ICs can crosslink the BCR with Fc RIIb whereupon the activation of BCR is inhibited by engagement of Fc RIIb and associated intracellular signaling pathways that interfere with the downstream pathways of BCR activation.

B cells function not only to produce antibodies and cytokines that control immune response they are also antigen presenting cells APCs . Internalization of antigen by BCR into a B cell can play a role in presentation to and activation of T cells. Regulation of B cell activation through the BCR is also potentially regulated by antibody engagement of Fc RIIb. Other APCs such as dendritic cells macrophages and monocytes are capable of internalizing antibody bound antigen through activating receptors such as Fc RIIa Fc RIIIa and Fc RI. Expression of Fc RIIb on these cell types particularly dendritic cells can inhibit activation of these cell types and subsequent presentation to and activation of T cells Desai et al. 2007 J Immunol .

A novel strategy for inhibiting activation of the aforementioned cell types it to use a single immunoglobulin to coengage Fc RIIb with surface antigen present on the Fc RIIb cell. In the case of B cells based on the natural biological mechanism this would potentially involve dual targeting of Fc RIIb and BCR with the goal of mimicking immune complex mediated suppression of B cell activation. illustrates one such potential mechanism in which an antibody is used to coengage both Fc RIIb via its Fc region and a target antigen associated with BCR complex in this example CD19 via its Fv region.

Under physiological conditions bridging of the BCR with Fc RIIb and subsequent B cell suppression occurs via immune complexes of IgGs and cognate antigen. The design strategy was to reproduce this effect using a single crosslinking antibody. Human IgG binds human Fc RIIb with weak affinity approximately 1 M for IgG1 and Fc RIIb mediated inhibition occurs in response to immune complexed but not monomeric IgG. It was reasoned that increasing Fc affinity to this receptor would be required for maximal inhibition of B cell activation. Protein engineering methods were used to design and screen Fc variants for enhanced Fc RIIb binding.

In addition to this primary design goal maximal Fc affinity to Fc RIIb a secondary design goal was to reduce interaction of the Fc region with activating Fc Rs. Fc R affinity profiles that may be optimal for inhibiting Fc RIIb cells include not only high affinity for the inhibitory receptor Fc RIIb but also potentially high Fc RIIb affinity coupled with reduced affinity for one or more activating receptors including for example Fc RI Fc RIIIa and or Fc RIIa. Reduced affinity to activating receptors may lead to reduced toxicity associated with an antibody treatment. For example reduced affinity to Fc RIIIa present on NK cells should reduce the level of NK cell mediated ADCC. Similarly reduced affinity to Fc RIIa present on a variety of effector cells including macrophages and neutrophils should reduce the level of phagocytosis ADCP mediated by these cells. In addition for monocytes macrophages dendritic cells and the like reduced interaction with activating Fc Rs would mean that immunoglobulin would be more free to interact with Fc RIIb on the cell surface.

Using solved structures of the human Fc Fc RIIIb complex and the sequences of the human Fc Rs structural and sequence analysis were used to identify Fc R positions that contribute to Fc RIIb affinity and selectivity relative to the activating receptors. The design strategy employed two steps. First Fc R positions that are determinants of Fc RIIb and Fc RIIIa binding selectivity were identified by accounting for proximity to the Fc R Fc interface and amino acid dissimilarity between Fc RIIb and Fc RIIIa. The results of this analysis are presented in . Second sequence positions in the Fc region proximal to these Fc R positions were identified. The results of this analysis are presented in . Fc variants were designed that incorporate substitutions at these positions.

A library of Fc variants was generated and screened to explore amino acid modifications at these positions. Variants were generated and screened in the context of an antibody targeting the antigen CD19 a regulatory component of the BCR coreceptor complex. The Fv region of the this antibody is a humanized and affinity matured version of antibody 4G7 and is referred to herein as HuAM4G7. The amino acid sequences of this antibody are provided in . The Fv genes for this antibody were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pTT5 National Research Council Canada . Mutations in the Fc domain were introduced using site directed mutagenesis QuikChange Stratagene Cedar Creek Tex. . In addition control knock out variants with ablated affinity for Fc receptors were generated that comprise the substitution L328R and either a G236R substitution or an Arg inserted after position 236. These variants G236R L328R and 236R L328R are referred to as Fc KO or Fc R knockout. To serve as non CD19 Fc isotype controls anti respiratory syncytial virus RSV and anti FITC antibodies were constructed in the pTT5 vector by fusing the appropriate Vand Vregions to the C and C1 3 domains with Fc changes. Heavy and light chain constructs were cotransfected into HEK293E cells for expression and antibodies were purified using protein A affinity chromatography Pierce Biotechnology Rockford Ill. .

Human Fc receptor proteins Fc RI and Fc RIIb for binding and competition studies were obtained from R D Systems Minneapolis Minn. . Genes encoding Fc RIIa and Fc RIIIa receptor proteins were obtained from the Mammalian Gene Collection ATCC and subcloned into pTT5 vector National Research Council Canada containing 6 His and GST tags. Allelic forms of the receptors H131 and R131 for Fc RII and V158 and F158 for Fc RIIIa were generated using QuikChange mutagenesis. Vectors encoding the receptors were transfected into HEK293T cells and proteins were purified using nickel affinity chromatography.

Variants were screened for receptor affinity using Biacore technology also referred to as Biacore herein a surface plasmon resonance SPR based technology for studying biomolecular interactions in real time. SPR measurements were performed using a Biacore 3000 instrument Biacore Piscataway N.J. . A protein A G Pierce Biotechnology CM5 biosensor chip Biacore was generated using a standard primary amine coupling protocol. All measurements were performed using HBS EP buffer 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4 0.15 M NaCl 3 mM EDTA 0.005 vol vol surfactant P20 Biacore . Antibodies at 20 nM or 50 nM in HBS EP buffer were immobilized on the protein A G surface and Fc Rs were injected. After each cycle the surface was regenerated by injecting glycine buffer 10 mM pH 1.5 . Data were processed by zeroing time and response before the injection of Fc R and by subtracting appropriate nonspecific signals response of reference channel and injection of running buffer . Kinetic analyses were performed by global fitting of binding data with a 1 1 Langmuir binding model using BIAevaluation software Biacore .

A representative set of sensorgrams for binding of select variant anti CD19 antibodies to Fc RIIb is shown in . The affinities equilibrium Kds of all variants and WT native IgG1 to all of the Fc Rs obtained from fits of the Biacore binding data are presented in . Whereas WT IgG1 Fc binds with Fc RIIb with M affinity Kd 1467 nM in a large number of variants have been engineered that bind more tightly. Because all of the antibodies tested have specificity for CD19 via their Fv region the binding results in . D are due solely to binding to Fc RIIb by the Fc region. This is supported by the lack of detectable binding by the Fc KO variants G236R L328R and 236R L328R which are ablated for binding to all Fc Rs.

A useful quantity for analysis of the variants is their fold affinity relative to WT IgG1 which is generated by dividing the Kd for binding of WT IgG1 by the Kd for binding of variant for each receptor. These fold affinity results are provided in . A number of variants have Fc RIIb binding enhancements over 2 logs and substantially reduced or ablated affinities for the activating receptors. In particular S267E single substitution as well as L235Y S267E G236D S267E S239D S267E S267E H268E and S267E L328F double substitutions have markedly higher affinity for Fc RIIb. In addition these variant have affinity for the activating receptor Fc RIIIa that is either comparable to native IgG1 modestly enhanced or even significantly reduced.

The data in indicate that the properties of the variants are highly dependent not only on the position that is mutated but also the precise amino acid that is substituted at each position. For example one of the strongest positions for controlling Fc RIIb affinity and selectivity relative to activating Fc Rs is position 267. Yet modification at this position can yield dramatically different results depending on the particular amino acid that is substituted in particular as shown in whereas affinity of S267E for Fc RIIb is greatly enhanced relative to WT IgG1 and provides substantial selectivity improvement relative to Fc RIIIa other substitutions such as S267A and S267G provide either marginal or no Fc RIIb enhancement and or little or no selectivity improvement relative to Fc RIIIa. The importance of the precise modification is further supported by the fact that two of the best positions for selectively enhancing Fc RIIb affinity 236 and 328 for example 236D and 328F are also the same positions that are modified to generate the Fc KO variant 236R and 328R . These results illustrate the complexity of the Fc R interface and highlight the challenge of engineering modifications that precisely control desired Fc R properties.

Many of the Fc combination variants including double and triple combinations of single substitutions exhibited unexpected synergy non additivity when compared against the single substitutions alone. This was determined for all combination variants for which data was available by comparing the actual fold improvement in affinity as measured by Biacore versus the expected fold improvement in affinity as calculated by the product of the fold improvements of the single substitutions . As can be seen from the data double substitutions at the following pairs of positions resulted in a greater than expected affinity for one or more Fc Rs 234 267 235 267 236 267 236 268 239 267 2391268 266 267 267 328 and 268 327.

In order to validate the Biacore data and evaluate receptor binding of the variants on the cell surface binding of select antibodies to cells expressing Fc RIIb was measured. Since HEK293T cells do not express CD19 or Fc Rs transfection of these cells with Fc RIIb allowed an analysis of antibody binding to Fc receptors in an isolated system on a cell surface. HEK293T cells in DMEM with 10 FBS were transfected with human Fc RIIb cDNA in pCMV6 expression vector Origene Technologies Rockville Md. cultured for 3 days harvested washed twice in PBS resuspended in PBS with 0.1 BSA PBS BSA and aliquoted at 2 105 cells per well into 96 well microtiter plates. Fc variant antibodies were serially diluted in PBS BSA then added to the cells and incubated with mixing for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing with PBS BSA phycoerythrin PE labeled anti human Fab specific goat F ab 2 fragment was added for detection. Cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature washed and resuspended in PBS BSA. Binding was evaluated using a FACSCanto II flow cytometer BD Biosciences San Jose Calif. and the mean fluorescence intensity MFI was plotted as a function of antibody concentration using GraphPad Prism software GraphPad Software San Diego Calif. from which half maximal binding EC50 values were determined by sigmoidal dose response modeling.

Receptor expression levels were assessed prior to binding of antibodies and half maximal effective concentration EC50 values of the MFI at different antibody concentrations were determined. shows the results of this experiment. The EC50 values of the variants tested showed a similar rank order as the Biacore results. The cell surface binding confirmed that the S267E L328F variant of those tested has the highest affinity for Fc RIIb with an EC50 approximately 320 fold relative to WT IgG1. The strong agreement between these cell surface binding data and the Biacore binding data support the accuracy of the affinity measurements.

Because of the importance of animal models in drug development select variants were screened further for binding to mouse and cynomolgous monkey receptors. The extracellular regions of mouse and cynologous monkey Fc Rs were expressed and purified. The extracellular regions of these receptors were obtained by PCR from clones obtained from the Mammalian Gene Collection MGC or generated de novo using recursive PCR. To enable purification and screening receptors were fused C terminally with a His and GST tag. Tagged Fc Rs were transfected into 293T cells and media containing secreted receptor were harvested 3 days later and purified using Nickel chromatography.

Variant antibodies were tested for their affinity to mouse or cynologous monkey Fc Rs using Biacore SPR as described above. Specifically antibodies were first immobilized on a protein A G chip to high density and then followed by injections of the extracellular domain of the mouse or cynologous monkey Fc R of interest. Both association and dissociation phases were tracked in real time using the Biacore technology. show the fold improvements compared to WT IgG1 for binding of select variants to mouse and cynologous monkey Fc Rs as determined from Biacore.

Although the variants were screened in the context of human IgG1 it is contemplated that the variants could be used in the context of other antibody isotypes for example including but not limited to human IgG2 human IgG3 and human IgG4 . In order to explore the transferability of the variants to other antibody isotypes the S267E L328F variant was constructed and tested in the context of a IgG1 2 ELLGG antibody which is a variant of an IgG2 Fc region U.S. Ser. No. 11 256 060 herein expressly incorporated by reference . The mutations were constructed antibodies purified and binding data carried out as described above. shows affinities of the IgG1 and IgG1 2 variant antibodies to the human Fc Rs as determined by Biacore. The data indicate that the greatly enhanced Fc RIIb affinity and the overall Fc R binding profile are maintained in the variant IgG2 Fc region thus supporting the use of the variants in other isotype contexts.

Collectively the above data indicate that a number of engineered variants at specific Fc positions provide the targeted properties namely enhanced affinity for Fc RIIb and selectively enhanced Fc RIIb affinity relative to the activating receptors Fc RI Fc RIIa and Fc RIIa. Substitutions to enhance affinity to Fc RIIb include 234 235 236 237 239 266 267 268 325 326 327 328 and 332. In some embodiments substitutions are made to at least one or more of the nonlimiting following positions to enhance affinity to Fc RIIb 235 236 239 266 267 268 and 328.

Although normal B cells have a long in vivo half life of approximately five weeks their lifespan is greatly reduced in vitro. BCR stimulation by crosslinking antibodies such as anti IgM or anti CD79b counteracts this in vitro predisposition towards apoptosis leading to B cell activation and increased B cell viability. To demonstrate this an ATP dependent B cell viability assay was performed. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs were purified from leukapheresis of anonymous healthy volunteers HemaCare Van Nuys Calif. using Ficoll Paque Plus density gradients Amersham Biosciences Newark N.J. . Primary human B cells were purified from PBMCs using a B cell enrichment kit StemCell Technologies Vancouver British Columbia . Murine anti human CD79b clone SN8 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Santa Cruz Calif. . Polyclonal anti mu F ab 2 was purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Lab West Grove Pa. . Anti mu or anti CD79b antibody serial dilutions were performed in triplicate in 96 well microtiter plates containing RPMi1640 with 10 FBS. Purified primary human B cells 5 7.5 104 per well were added to a final volume of 100 l and incubated at 37 C. for 3 days. ATP dependent luminescence was quantified to determine cell viability Cell Titer Glo Cell Viability Assay Promega Madison Wis. and a Topcount luminometer PerkinElmer Waltham Mass. was used for data acquisition. show the results of the assay demonstrating the survival of primary human B cells upon BCR activation here carried out by crosslinking with anti mu A or anti CD79b B antibodies. In vivo such activation would occur via immune complexed antigen which for example could be an infectious agent or in the cause of an autoimmune or allergic reaction could be an autoimmune antigen or allergen.

The ATP dependent luminescence assay was used to examine if BCR activation mediated viability of primary human B cells could be suppressed by an anti CD19 antibody having enhanced Fc affinity for Fc RIIb. The above experiment was repeated except that antibody serial dilutions of WT variant and control antibodies were performed in triplicate in 96 well microtiter plates containing RPMI1640 with 10 FBS plus anti CD79b at 1 g ml to stimulate BCR. The results are shown in . Again B cells possessed low viability in the absence of BCR crosslinking and addition of 10 g ml anti CD79b antibody stimulated survival by about 6 fold cells alone vs. anti CD79b . Anti CD19 S267E L328F the variant with the highest Fc RIIb affinity inhibited BCR stimulated viability in a dose dependent manner. In contrast control antibodies including anti CD19 IgG1 Fv control and anti RSV S267E L328F Fc control minimally suppressed viability. To assess if this inhibitory effect required coengagement of CD19 and Fc RIIb as opposed to simultaneous binding of each receptor by different antibodies the anti CD19 S267E L328F variant was compared to a combination of anti CD19 IgG1 and anti RSV S267E L328F controls at equal concentrations. The combination of these antibodies should simultaneously bind to both CD19 and Fc RIIb but unlike anti CD19 S267E L328F is unable to crosslink these receptors. As shown in the combination failed to suppress BCR activation induced survival indicating that coengagement of Fc RIIb and CD19 by a single molecule is required to inhibit BCR mediated viability. Not all variants were capable of inhibiting B cell activation. As demonstrated in variants with moderately increased affinity relative to WT IgG1 S267A 408 nM 3.6 fold relative to native IgG1 do not inhibit B cell activation. In contrast that data in demonstrate that variants with high affinity here the weakest affinity being the S267E variant 71.9 nM 20.4 fold relative to native IgG1 do indeed inhibit activation. Together the results in and suggest that a certain high affinity for Fc RIIb about 100 nM is needed to mediate inhibitory activity upon coengagement of Fc RIIb and BCR co receptor target antigen.

Signals through the B cell receptor complex ultimately result in calcium release and this pathway can be inhibited by Fc RIIb Nielsen et al. 2005 Transfus Med Hemother 32 339 347 incorporated entirely by reference . Intracellular calcium mobilization was used as a quantitative measure of BCR mediated B cell activation to further evaluate the impact of the immunoglobulins. The current study used primary B cells from normal human donors as a more physiologically relevant model of calcium signaling. In addition rather than stimulating primarily naive B cells via an anti IgM antibody an anti human CD79b Ig antibody was used in order to induce BCR activation in both naive and memory B cells.

Intracellular free calcium concentration Ca2 was measured by flow cytometry using a Fluo 4 NW calcium assay Molecular Probes Eugene Oreg. . Purified human B cells were resuspended at 5 105 cells ml in calcium assay buffer and pre loaded with Fluo 4 dye for 30 min at room temperature. After incubation with anti CD19 or Fc and Fv control antibodies cells were stimulated by addition of 10 g ml of anti CD79b antibody. Calcium flux kinetics was recorded using a FACSCanto II flow cytometer and data were analyzed using FlowJo software Tree Star Ashland Oreg. .

Calcium mobilization in the presence of 10 g ml anti CD19 native IgG1 Fc antibody CD19 native IgG1 was increased relative to the vehicle control as expected from coengagement of CD19 and BCR. In contrast IIbE variants of anti CD19 IgG1 also at 10 g ml inhibited calcium mobilization induced by BCR crosslinking with the two highest affinity variants showing greatest activity. To determine the importance of CD19 binding for this effect an Fc isotype control antibody was used that binds with high affinity to Fc RIIb but not to CD19 this antibody referred to as FITC S267E L328F in has the S267E L328F IgG1 heavy chain but an Fv region that binds the hapten FITC which is not on B cells . Relative to vehicle this antibody had minimal effect on calcium mobilization indicating that CD19 binding is required to inhibit calcium mobilization. A dose response extension of this experiment was carried out in which each point represents the area under the curve of a single calcium mobilization response as in . The data show that potency and efficacy of IIbE variants correlated with affinity for Fc RIIb consistent with the B cell viability assay with anti CD19 Native IgG1 showing no dose response . The relationship between the EC50 of calcium inhibition and affinity for Fc RIIb is shown in .

To assess if the observed inhibition of calcium flux required engagement of both Fc RIIb and CD19 by a single antibody a competition experiment was performed. Because Fc RI has the highest affinity among all the Fc Rs and competes with Fc RIIb for IgG binding data not shown a 24 fold molar excess soluble Fc RI solFc RI to block the interaction of the highest affinity antibody CD19 S267E L328F with Fc RIIb . BCR induced calcium mobilization was again effectively inhibited by 10 g ml CD19 S267E L328F but not by CD19 Native IgG1. Notably inhibition by the IIbE variant was completely abolished in the presence of soluble Fc RI indicating that Fc RIIb engagement is required. These results indicate that BCR induced calcium mobilization can be inhibited by a single antibody that binds with high affinity to both Fc RIIb and CD19 surface receptors.

Together the B cell viability and calcium mobilization results suggest that Fc variant antibodies with high affinity for Fc RIIb may be useful in methods for inhibiting activation of B cells. The data provided indicate that amino acid modification at positions 234 235 236 237 239 266 267 268 325 326 327 328 and 332 may be useful for such inhibitory methods. In particular the data provided indicate that substitutions 234D 234E 234W 235D 235F 235R 235Y 236D 236N 237D 237N 239D 239E 266M 267D 267E 268D 268E 327D 327E 328F 328W 328Y and I332E may be useful for such inhibitory methods.

SHIP activation is an Fc RIIb dependent downstream component of ITIM associated signaling. The capacity of the anti CD19 S267E L328F antibody to stimulate SHIP phosphorylation pSHIP in the context of BCR activation by anti CD79b crosslinking antibody was assessed using western analysis. Purified primary human B cells 1 107 were incubated for 10 min at 22 C. with 20 g ml anti CD79b and 10 g ml anti CD19 antibodies and then ice cold PBS was added. For the positive control 10 g ml of anti Fc RII specific antibody AT10 AbD Serotec Raleigh N.C. was used to crosslink Fc RIIb and 20 g ml anti mouse IgG Fc specific antibody was used to crosslink AT10 and anti CD79b. Cells were lysed in cold RIPA buffer Cell Signaling Beverly Mass. containing protease Roche Indianapolis Ind. and phosphatase Calbiochem San Diego Calif. inhibitor cocktails with 2 nM microcystin Calbiochem and incubated for 30 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 30 min at 4 C. to remove debris fractionated by SDS PAGE NuPAGE Novex Invitrogen Life Technologies Carlsbad Calif. and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane Invitrogen Life Technologies . Western analysis was performed with phospho SHIP Cell Signaling Technologies Beverly Mass. and GAPDH specific primary antibodies Biovision Mountain View Calif. using HRP conjugated anti mouse IgG secondary antibody with enhanced chemiluminescence imaging Amersham Bioscience Newark N.J. and a UVP Bioimaging image capturing system Upland Calif. .

The data are presented in . The western blot of cell extracts from purified primary human B cells showed that the anti CD19 IIbE variant stimulated a substantial increase in pSHIP level compared to anti CD19 IgG1 and other controls anti RSV S267E L328F and anti CD19 Fc KO lane 1 vs. lanes 2 4 . As expected direct crosslinking of Fc RIIb with BCR by anti Fc RII antibody also showed an increase in pSHIP level lane 5 . These results indicate that suppression of B cell function by the anti CD19 IIbE antibody stimulates SHIP phosphorylation which is consistent with a known signaling pathway of BCR Fc RIIb coengagement.

Although normal B cells in vivo have a long half life of approximately 5 weeks in vitro this lifespan is greatly reduced with increased apoptosis due to the lack of appropriate niche. B cell activation via stimulation via the BCR induces an anti apoptotic effect and prolongs viability as demonstrated in . In order to determine whether the antiproliferative activity of the IIbE variant was a result of neutralizing BCR mediated survival signals thereby allowing in vitro apoptosis to proceed an annexin V staining assay was performed. 1 105 purified primary human B cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 C. in triplicate with 1 g ml anti CD79b and serial dilutions of anti CD19 or control antibodies in 100 l RPMI1640 with 10 FBS. After incubation cells were harvested and stained with PE conjugated annexin V Biovision Mountain View Calif. and 7 amino actinomycin D 7 AAD Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. at 5 g ml. The annexin V positive 7 AAD negative cells were acquired using a FACSCanto II flow cytometer and analyzed with FACSDiva 5 analysis software BD Biosciences .

The data are shown in . Annexin V staining of primary human B cells cultured in the presence or absence of anti CD79b confirmed that apoptosis was suppressed by BCR activation cells alone vs. anti CD79b . This survival signal was neutralized in a dose dependent manner by anti CD19 S267E L328F but not by anti RSV S267E L328F Fc control or anti CD19 IgG1 Fv control antibodies. Inhibition of the anti apoptotic effect like inhibition of calcium mobilization and cell proliferation requires coengagement of CD19 and Fc RIIb by a single antibody because the combination of anti CD19 IgG1 and anti RSV S267E L328F Fv and Fc controls respectively did not stimulate apoptosis. These data indicate that the anti CD19 IIbE variant inhibits BCR induced B cell proliferation by suppressing anti apoptotic survival signals.

In order to evaluate the effect of modulating Fc RIIIa affinity the immunoglobulins were examined for their ADCC activity. Antibody serial dilutions were carried out in 96 well microtiter plates in triplicates and incubated with Ramos target cells 10 000 total to opsonize the target cells for 15 minutes. Ramos is an immortal huma B cell line derived from Burkitt s lymphoma cells. Purified NK cells 50 000 total using negative selection kit from frozen PBMC prepared from leukophoresis pack using standard Ficoll density gradient were added to appropriate concentration. The final working ADCC reaction was in 100 ul of 1 FBS RPMI1640 for 4 hours at 37 C. after which the amount of LDH released from the target cells was detected using fluorescent detection system. The percentage of ADCC was determined by normalizing the background LDH activity target and NK together without antibody adjusted experimental LDH activity against the total LDH activity present in the target cells spontaneous LDH activity present in the target cells alone adjusted TritonX100 lysed target cells . As shown in many of the variants with enhanced Fc RIIb affinity yet lower or equivalent Fc RIIa affinity compared with wild type IgG1 including S267E G236D S267E and S267E L328F lack ADCC activity. This is attributed to their reduced or ablated affinity for the activating Fc Rs particularly Fc RIIIa which is the sole Fc R expressed on NK cells.

Immunoglobulins were also tested for their capacity to mediate phagocytosis by macrophages. Target cells were RS4 11 cells an immortal human B cell line derived from leukemia cells. Macrophages express a variety of Fc Rs including Fc RI Fc RIIa Fc RIIb and Fc RIIIa. Purified monocytes were differentiated in the presence of macrophage colony stimulating factor for 5 days into macrophages. Macrophages were mixed with fluorescently labeled PKH26 RS4 11 cells in 10 human AB serum in RPMI followed by the addition of anti CD19 antibodies and incubated for 4 hours at 37 C. APC conjugated antibodies to CD14 and CD11b were added to the cell mixture washed and fixed. Phagocytosis was determined by the percentage CD14 CD11b and PKH26 double positive population divided by the total number of stained tumors. The data are shown in . Anti CD19 IgG1 and the variant S239D 1332E demonstrated phagocytosis. In contrast variants with enhanced Fc RIIb affinity yet reduced affinity for activating receptors including S267E L328F and G236D S267E had little or not phagocytic activity comparable to control antibody that targeted RSV.

Immunoglobulins were also tested for their capacity to mediate CDC. Release of Alamar Blue was used to monitor lysis of a target B cell line by human serum complement. Raji cells an immortal B cell line were washed in 10 FBS medium by centrifugation and resuspension and loaded into 96 well plates at 40 000 cells per well. Variant anti CD19 antibodies or Rituxan anti CD20 control were added in fold dilutions to the indicated final concentrations. Human serum complement Quidel was diluted 1 to 5 with medium and added to antibody opsonized target cells. Plates were incubated for 2 hrs at 37 C. Alamar Blue was added cells were cultured overnight and fluorescence was measured. Data from this assay are shown in . In contrast to the anti CD20 control the variant anti CD19 antibodies do not mediate CDC activity against B cells.

A hallmark of autoimmunity in mouse and human is dysregulation of Fc RIIb expression resulting in lower surface level of this inhibitory receptor leading to an elevated level of B cell activation and consequential failure of self reactive B cell inhibition and production of plasma cells secreting self antigen specific immunoglobulins. Such self reactive immunoglobulin immune complexes are etiologic agents in various organ failures in systemic autoimmunity and other arthritic inflammations such as systemic lupus erythematosus SLE and rheumatoid arthritis RA. The immunoglobulins disclosed herein were assessed using a huPBL SCID mouse model as a proxy by examining B cell activity measured by the number of B cells and plasma cell development by detecting the antigen specific immunoglobulins. In this method human PBLs from normal or diseased e.g. SLE or RA donors are engrafted to immune deficient SCID mice and treated with the inhibitory immunoglobulin described herein then challenged with an antigen to examine the course of B cell development into plasma cells. In such case the production of antigen specific immunoglobulins is inhibited from which can be inferred inhibition of both B cell activation and differentiation.

The protocol for this study is provided in . Four different groups of mice with five mice in each group were engrafted with human PBLs from a healthy donor. At day 16 test articles consisting of PBS vehicle control anti CD19 with native IgG1 Fc anti CD19 IgG1 WT anti CD19 with IgG1 Fc of enhanced affinity for Fc RIIb anti CD19 S267E L328F or Rituximab IgG1 anti CD20 were given 10 mg kg twice weekly for a total of 6 doses. At day 24 antigen challenge with tetanus toxoid fragment C was given and mice were sacrificed at days 31 and 38. Tetanus toxoid TT specific antibody production was examined. The results of this experiment are shown in . The data shows that before the antigen challenge the level of anti TT specific antibody was very low in all the groups. After immunization the untreated PBS control group showed the highest level of anti TT specific antibody level. In comparison the B cell depleting anti CD20 antibody produced low level of antigen specific antibody level. After immunization the anti CD19 S267E L328F group showed the lowest level of antigen specific antibodies whereas the anti CD19 IgG1 WT produced a higher level of antigen specific antibody. These in vivo data show that the anti CD19 antibody with enhanced Fc RIIb affinity is capable of inhibiting B cell activation and immunoglobulin secreting plasma cell differentiation and thus support the potential of the immunoglobulins disclosed herein for treating autoimmune and inflammatory disorders.

The use of antibodies to coengage CD19 and Fc RIIb is an example of how simultaneous high affinity engagement of a B cell antigen and Fc RIIb may be used to inhibit activation or proliferation of Fc RIIb cells. As discussed above Fc RIIb is a negative regulator of a number of cell types including but not limited to B cells plasma cells monocytes macrophages dendritic cells neutrophils basophils eosinophils and mast cells. A variety of antigens expressed on these Fc RIIb cell types may be also be co targeted with high affinity Fc RIIb binding to inhibit cellular activation and or proliferation. provides a number of examples of antigens and cell types that may be targeted by the immunoglobulins disclosed herein.

At the outset it is not clear which antigens may serve as effective co targets with Fc RIIb for modulation of cellular activity. A likely key aspect of a potential co target is its functional role in the cell and in particular whether its intracellular signaling pathways if any overlap with those of Fc RIIb. CD19 is a co receptor of the BCR complex and thus the capacity of high affinity co engagement of CD19 and Fc RIIb to inhibit B cell activation is likely related to the association of CD19 with BCR and the negative regulatory role of Fc RIIb in inhibiting BCR stimulated activation. Importantly however CD19 is not involved in antigen recognition which is the specific function of the IgM component of the BCR. Rather CD19 and other proteins such as CD21 CD22 CD72 CD81 and Leu13 are BCR co receptors. Of course targeting of other components of the BCR including the antigen recognition domain also referred to as IgM and the signaling domains CD79a Ig and CD79b Ig is also supported by the data herein. However given the complex biochemical pathways involved in regulating cellular activation and proliferation of these cell types evaluating which antigens may serve as effective co targets with Fc RIIb for modulation of cellular activity requires experimentation.

In order to evaluate which antigens may be effective co targets with Fc RIIb for modulating cellular activity the S267E L328F high Fc RIIb affinity variant along with WT IgG1 and Fc KO variant s 236R L328R and or G236R L328R were cloned into antibodies specific for a variety of other antigens expressed on Fc RIIb cells including CD19 CD20 CD22 CD23 CD40 CD52 and CD79b. In several cases multiple Fv s targeting the same antigen were constructed in order to assess the epitope dependence of the effects. list the heavy and light chain variable regions VH and VL of the antibodies used. The VH and VL genes targeting these antigens were constructed by gene synthesis and variants were constructed expressed and purified as described above.

The effect of high affinity co engagement of these antigens with Fc RIIb was evaluated using the ATP dependent luminescence B cell viability assay as described above. show the results of these experiments. The data indicate that CD79b is also an effective co target for using high affinity Fc RIIb co engagement to inhibit B cell activation. This is consistent with its role as the signaling component of the BCR complex. Results using two additional anti CD19 antibodies again confirmed the amenability of this antigen to controlling B cell activation using high affinity Fc RIIb co ligation irrespective of the specific epitope targeted. In contrast no effect of high affinity Fc RIIb co engagement was observed for antibodies with specificity for CD20 CD23 and CD52. Unexpectedly dual targeting of Fc RIIb using antibodies having specificity for CD22 and CD40 resulted in enhanced B cell activation. In the case of CD22 this may be the result of its role as a negative regulator of BCR activation. In the case of CD40 this may be the result of its role as a positive regulator of B cell activation via engagement at the T cell interface. It is known that some of the antibodies used are agonist that is to say that their binding of CD40 on B cells and other cells promotes positive signaling and activation of B cells. In a sense these antibodies are mimicking the co activation signal of a T cell. The antibody and thus epitope dependence of this activation is likely related to the capacity of the antibodies to agonize. The reason for the enhanced agonism and stimulation of the B cells upon high affinity S267E L328F engagement of Fc RIIb but not using WT IgG1 or Fc KO is not currently clear and requires further study.

Select antibodies targeting other antigens were tested further for their capacity to inhibit intracellular calcium mobilization using the assay described above. The results in agree well with the data from the B cell viability assay. Whereas high affinity co ligation of Fc RIIb and CD23 had no effect on calcium mobilization CD79b is an effective co target for inhibition of calcium. High affinity Fc RIIb co ligation with CD22 and CD40 resulted in an increase in calcium mobilization again consistent with the viability results.

In order to screen a larger set of antigens using commercial reagents a novel method was developed for evaluating the capacity of Fc RIIb antigen co engagement to inhibit of cellular activity. This approach uses a haptenized version of an antibody or ligand that has specificity for the target antigen together with variant versions of an anti hapten antibody. This concept is illustrated in . A variety of haptens are known in the art that may be used for this approach including but not limited to FITC biotin and nitrophenyl.

The VH and VL genes of the anti FITC antibody 4 4 20 were constructed by gene synthesis and variants were constructed with enhanced affinity for Fc RIIb S267E L328F along with WT IgG1 and Fc R knockout variant s 236R L328R and or G236R L328F . Antibodies were constructed expressed and purified as described above. Commercial antibodies targeting antigens mu CD19 CD20 CD21 CD24 CD35 CD45RA CD72 CD79a CD79b CD80 CD81 CD86 and HLA DR were purchased from Beckman Coulter Fullerton Calif. BD Pharmingen San Jose Calif. AbD Serotec Raleigh N.C. or GenTex Inc. San Antonio Tex. . FITC labeling reagent Pierce Biotech Inc. Rockford Ill. was used to label commercial antibodies according to the supplied protocol at either room temperature or 37 C. for 1 hour. After labeling un reacted label was removed using BioSpin P 6 or P 30 columns from BioRad Hercules Calif. and used with varying concentrations of anti FITC antibodies in proliferation experiments as described above.

The effectiveness of the hapten approach for screening antigens was first confirmed using anti and anti CD19 antibodies two antigens that are known to mediate inhibitory activity upon high affinity co engagement with Fc RIIb. show anti FITC antibody variants with high affinity for Fc RIIb but not WT IgG1 or Fc KO variants are able to inhibit B cell activation in the presence of FITC labeled anti mu and anti CD19 antibodies. These data are consistent with the above approach wherein variants were incorporated directly into the antibody with specificity for CD19 or mu and thus confirm the use of the hapten approach for screening target antigens for capacity to modulate cellular activity upon high affinity co engagement with Fc RIIb.

Whereas particular embodiments have been described above for purposes of illustration it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that numerous variations of the details may be made without departing from the invention as described in the appended claims.
