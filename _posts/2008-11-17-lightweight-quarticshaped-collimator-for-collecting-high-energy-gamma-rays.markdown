To collimate with a conventional cylindrical detector of gamma rays a long hollow tube is surrounded with shielding sufficient to attenuate un collimated gamma rays. Much work has been done on improving collimators but mostly for the lower energies used in medical applications typically 0.511 MeV and for exotic detectors. For high energy gamma rays typically 2.6 MeV such as those emitted from soil and objects in the soil proper collimation requires an inordinate amount of shielding material on the order of hundreds of pounds of lead shielding.

Select embodiments of the present invention minimize the shielding material required for proper collimation of high energy gamma rays. In select embodiments of the present invention the weight of shielding is minimized and the collimator tube is portable.

Select embodiments of the present invention envision a lightweight collimator having a top and a bottom and incorporating shielding about a cylindrical detector having a top and a bottom the detector affixed near the top of the collimator for collecting collimated radiation through the bottom of the collimator at least the shielding for collimator shaped externally according to a quartic relationship 

In select embodiments of the present invention the shielding is made by machining solid shielding material. In select embodiments of the present invention the shielding is made by pouring molten shielding material into forms.

In select embodiments of the present invention the radiation comprises at least gamma rays and the detector is a gamma ray detector.

In select embodiments of the present invention the shielding material comprises at least in part lead.

Select embodiments of the present invention comprise a method for making a lightweight collimator for collecting radiation the collimator having at least a top and a bottom the collimator for collecting collimated radiation through the bottom of the collimator. The method comprises providing a cylindrical detector the detector having a top and a bottom affixing the detector near the top of the collimator providing a cylindrical tube having an inside diameter of at least the outside diameter of the detector the tube for collecting the radiation connecting the cylindrical tube to the bottom of the detector providing shielding to be incorporated within the collimator and about the detector and the cylindrical tube at least the shielding to be shaped in accordance with the above quartic relationship fabricating a configuration to enclose the detector the shielding and the tube and enclosing the detector the shielding and the tube in the configuration such that the collimator may be shaped externally according to the quartic relationship by conformally covering the shaped shielding and such that at least the shielding has a variable wall thickness that decreases gradually from a thickness Lat the top of the collimator to a thickness y measured at a distance z away from the bottom of the detector.

In select embodiments of the present invention the method comprises making the shielding machining solid shielding material. In select embodiments of the present invention the method comprises making the shielding by pouring molten shielding material into forms shaped in accordance with the above quartic relationship.

In select embodiments of the present invention the method comprises providing as the detector at least one capable of detecting high energy gamma rays. In select embodiments of the present invention the shielding material comprises at least in part lead.

Refer to . Select embodiments of the present invention comprise a shaped collimator having a fixed inner diameter D and a variable wall thickness L that decreases gradually from a thickness L at the top end of the collimator to a smaller thickness y a distance z away as measured along the longitudinal axis of the collimator in accordance with the above quartic relationship.

Refer to depicting a prior art collimator . The detector is enclosed in a cylindrical case filled with conventional lead shielding . The detector collects gamma rays via a cylindrical collimator tube . Some of the collimated gamma rays not shown separately from soil and other gamma sources pass directly into the collimator tube and the detector . Un collimated gamma rays can reach the detector only after passing through the shielding thus are blocked. It is desirable for un collimated gamma rays to be blocked by a sufficient thickness of shielding but the same thickness is not required for portions of the collimator tube remote from the detector .

The prior art collimator tube of employs a full thickness L of shielding for the entire length of its case . For the portion of the collimator tube not near the detector it is possible for un collimated gamma rays to be blocked by just the horizontal thickness of the tube and the case and therefore the thickness of the shielding may be reduced at the lower collection end of the tube .

Refer to illustrating an embodiment of the present invention a collimator with a tapered case and a reduced amount of shielding . The detector is surrounded by conventional lead shielding but an outer collimator case tapered In accordance with a mathematical relationship reduces the amount of shielding at the collection end of the tube .

Refer to showing a portion of the longitudinal cross section of the collimator case with detector and shielding installed. The collimator tube has a fixed inner diameter D corresponding to the diameter of the detector . The thickness of the shielding decreases gradually from a thickness L at the end of the tube attached to the detector to a smaller thickness y a distance z away as measured along the longitudinal axis of the tube according to the quartic formula given above. The formula establishes the minimum y to attenuate un collimated gamma rays entering portions of the collimator from its collection point above the soil to the detector .

Refer to depicting a quartic shape employed with select embodiments of the present invention. For this shape 82 less shielding is needed than that employed in the prior art shown in . Shown is the actual shape to scale of the longitudinal cross section that may be employed with an embodiment of the present invention. For this embodiment the length of the collimator is 20 times the diameter D and the shielding thickness L is 1.9 D.

For select embodiments of the present invention a collimator may be made by machining solid shielding material to a quartic shape or alternatively by making quartic shaped forms into which molten lead is poured. Select embodiments of the present invention are used with a cylindrical detector by attaching the case and shielding in a continuous configuration to parts of the housing of the detector . The detector itself may incorporate shielding e.g. on the back of the detector .

Any advantages and benefits described may not apply to all embodiments of the invention.

While the invention has been described in terms of some of its embodiments those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modifications within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. For example although the system is described in specific examples for reducing the amount of shielding needed for a collimator used to collect gamma rays it may be used for any type of testing or monitoring and thus may be useful in such diverse applications as structural monitoring mining drilling remediating environmental intervention military operations and the like. Structure monitored or tested may be of any type ranging from naturally occurring to manmade. In the claims means plus function clauses are intended to cover the structures described herein as performing the recited function and not only structural equivalents but also equivalent structures. Thus although a nail and a screw may not be structural equivalents in that a nail employs a cylindrical surface to secure wooden parts together whereas a screw employs a helical surface in the environment of fastening wooden parts a nail and a screw may be equivalent structures. Thus it is intended that all matter contained in the foregoing description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative rather than limiting and the invention should be defined only in accordance with the following claims and their equivalents.
