The present disclosure relates generally to e commerce transaction techniques and more specifically to a system and method for managing e commerce transactions.

On line commerce which can be referred to as e commerce has over the years achieved widespread acceptance thanks to the expansive growth of the Internet and the growing sophistication of on line merchant systems. Consumers today can purchase goods or services from on line merchants over secure communication interfaces operating according to protocols such as a Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure HTTPS . E commerce transactions using the HTTPS protocol usually show an iconic symbol such as a pad lock somewhere in the browser window to indicate to the user that the communication with the on line merchant is secure.

Sophisticated e commerce systems have provided users a means to purchase or sell goods by fixed price or auctioning methods. Many retailers today also offer their consumers the convenience to purchase their products over on line systems. To enhance a user s security in e commerce transactions payments systems such as PayPal can be used to protect the privacy of sensitive consumer information such as bank accounts and credit card information during an e commerce transaction.

One embodiment of the present disclosure can entail an avatar engine having a controller to retrieve a user profile of a user present the user an avatar having characteristics that correlate to the user profile detect one or more responses of the user during a communication exchange between the avatar and the user identify from the one or more responses a need to engage in an e commerce transaction engage in a commercial exchange with a merchant system according to the e commerce transaction identify a commercial status of the e commerce transaction from the commercial exchange with the merchant system and present the user by way of the avatar the commercial status of the e commerce transaction.

Another embodiment of the present disclosure can entail presenting a user an avatar having characteristics that correlate to a profile of the user identifying from a communication exchange between the user and the avatar a need to engage in an e commerce transaction identifying a merchant system that satisfies the identified need and engaging in a commercial exchange with the merchant system according to the e commerce transaction.

Yet another embodiment of the present disclosure can entail a computer readable storage medium having computer instructions for presenting a user an avatar having characteristics that correlate to a profile of the user identifying from a communication exchange between the user and the avatar a need to engage in an e commerce transaction and engaging in a commercial exchange with a merchant system according to the identified e commerce transaction.

The VHS then distributes multimedia broadcast programs via an access network to commercial and or residential buildings housing a gateway such as a residential gateway or RG . The access network can represent a bank of digital subscriber line access multiplexers DSLAMs located in a central office or a service area interface that provide broadband services over optical links or copper twisted pairs to buildings . The gateway distributes broadcast signals to media processors such as Set Top Boxes STBs which in turn present broadcast selections to media devices such as computers or television sets managed in some instances by a media controller such as an infrared or RF remote control . Unicast traffic can also be exchanged between the media processors and subsystems of the IPTV media system for services such as video on demand VoD . It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the media devices and or portable communication devices shown in can be an integral part of the media processor and can be communicatively coupled to the gateway .

For example a user can access the TV2 server using a personal computer coupled to the public network .

The avatar engine of can be operably coupled to the third communication system for purposes similar to those described above.

It should be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art from the foregoing media communication system embodiments that other suitable media communication systems for distributing broadcast media content as well as peer to peer exchange of content can be applied to the present disclosure.

The communication system can comprise a Home Subscriber Server HSS a tElephone NUmber Mapping ENUM server and network elements of an IMS network . The IMS network can be coupled to IMS compliant communication devices CD or a Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN CD using a Media Gateway Control Function MGCF that connects the call through a common PSTN network .

IMS CDs register with the IMS network by contacting a Proxy Call Session Control Function P CSCF which communicates with a corresponding Serving CSCF S CSCF to register the CDs with an Authentication Authorization and Accounting AAA supported by the HSS . To accomplish a communication session between CDs an originating IMS CD can submit a Session Initiation Protocol SIP INVITE message to an originating P CSCF which communicates with a corresponding originating S CSCF . The originating S CSCF can submit the SIP INVITE message to an application server AS such as reference that can provide a variety of services to IMS subscribers. For example the application server can be used to perform originating treatment functions on the calling party number received by the originating S CSCF in the SIP INVITE message.

Originating treatment functions can include determining whether the calling party number has international calling services and or is requesting special telephony features such as 72 forward calls 73 cancel call forwarding 67 for caller ID blocking and so on . Additionally the originating S CSCF can submit queries to the ENUM system to translate an E. telephone number to a SIP Uniform Resource Identifier URI if the targeted communication device is IMS compliant. If the targeted communication device is a PSTN device the ENUM system will respond with an unsuccessful address resolution and the S CSCF will forward the call to the MGCF via a Breakout Gateway Control Function BGCF .

When the ENUM server returns a SIP URI the SIP URI is used by an Interrogating CSCF I CSCF to submit a query to the HSS to identify a terminating S CSCF associated with a terminating IMS CD such as reference . Once identified the I CSCF can submit the SIP INVITE to the terminating S CSCF which can call on an application server similar to reference to perform the originating treatment telephony functions described earlier. The terminating S CSCF can then identify a terminating P CSCF associated with the terminating CD . The P CSCF then signals the CD to establish communications. The aforementioned process is symmetrical. Accordingly the terms originating and terminating in can be interchanged.

IMS network can also be operably coupled to the avatar engine previously discussed for . In this representative embodiment the avatar engine can be accessed over a PSTN or VoIP channel of communication system by common techniques such as described above.

The transceiver can also support common wireline access technologies such as circuit switched wireline access technologies packet switched wireline access technologies or combinations thereof. PSTN can represent one of the common circuit switched wireline access technologies. Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP and IP data communications can represent some of the commonly available packet switched wireline access technologies. The transceiver can also be adapted to support IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS protocol for interfacing to an IMS network that can combine PSTN and VoIP communication technologies.

The UI can include a depressible or touch sensitive keypad and a navigation mechanism such as a roller ball joystick mouse and or navigation disk for manipulating operations of the communication device . The keypad can be an integral part of a housing assembly of the communication device or an independent device operably coupled thereto by a tethered wiring interface such as a USB or a wireless interface supporting for example Bluetooth. The keypad can represent a numeric dialing keypad commonly used by phones and or a Qwerty keypad with alphanumeric keys.

The UI can further include a display such as monochrome or color LCD Liquid Crystal Display OLED Organic Light Emitting Diode or other suitable display technology for conveying images to the end user of the communication device . In an embodiment where the display is touch sensitive a portion or all of the keypad can be presented by way of the display. The UI can also include an audio system that utilizes common audio technology for conveying low volume audio such as audio heard only in the proximity of a human ear and high volume audio such as speakerphone for hands free operation . The audio system can further include a microphone for receiving audible signals of an end user.

The power supply can utilize common power management technologies such as replaceable and rechargeable batteries supply regulation technologies and charging system technologies for supplying energy to the components of the communication device to facilitate long range or short range portable applications. The controller can utilize computing technologies such as a microprocessor and or digital signal processor DSP with associated storage memory such a Flash ROM RAM SRAM DRAM or other storage technologies.

The HDTV can also have a common camera sensor for capturing still and or moving images of the user which can be displayed in part by the HDTV as a picture in picture PIP image . The visual images of the user can be conveyed to the STB . Speech can be detected by a microphone of an audio system of the remote control or an audio system of the STB . The avatar can be an animated image or can have human like qualities such as the avatar image . The STB can transmit to the avatar engine the visual images as well as speech signals of the user for analysis.

The avatar engine can also be communicatively coupled to a mobile phone with a camera that can convey still or moving images of the user to the avatar engine. The mobile phone can have an audio system for receiving responses of the user and for conveying the user s speech to the avatar engine . The audio system can also have a loud speaker to convey to the user synthesized speech of the avatar for hands free operations. To avoid disturbing others the mobile phone can also incorporate common Bluetooth wireless transceiver technology to communicate with a common Bluetooth headset worn by the user . Similarly the avatar engine can be communicatively coupled to a computer with similar resources as the mobile phone .

With system in mind method can begin with step in which the avatar engine retrieves a user profile associated with the user of the iMCS . This step can be responsive to the user requesting access to the avatar by initiating a speech command or tactile command such as selecting an avatar request button on the remote control that is detected by the STB and thereby conveyed to the avatar engine . The user profile can include demographic profiling information of the user psychographic profiling information of the user and or user preferences supplied by the user. The demographic profiling information of the user can be based on age gender income number of occupants in household occupation education value of residential property location of residential property and or fees paid for services rendered by the iMCS just to name a few possibilities.

The demographic profiling information of the user can be determined from a subscriber account of the user and or monitored media consumption behavior of the user. One or more network elements of the iMCS can utilize common demographic analysis tools to make these determinations.

The psychographic profiling information of the user can also be determined from monitored media consumption behavior of the user and or subscriber account information. Utilizing common psychographic analysis tools one or more network elements of the iMCS can generate the psychographic profiling information of the user . The psychographic profiling information can identify one or more traits attitudes interests and or lifestyles of the user .

User preferences supplied by the user can identify for example a preferred gender for the avatar a preferred image could be an image of the user an image of a friend or spouse of the user celebrity etc. a preferred personality for the avatar mild mannered avatar preferred search preferences preferred content sources preferred merchants for purchasing or selling goods or services and so on.

In step the avatar engine can present on the HDTV the avatar correlated to the user profile as described above. The avatar engine can use common correlation technology to statistically generate an avatar image that is likely suited for the user according to the aforementioned aspects provided by the user profile. Using common speech synthesis and recognition technology the avatar engine can interact with the user by way of the avatar to provide interactive media services. The interactive function can be initiated by the user with speech or tactile responses on the remote control which can be detected by the avatar engine in step by way of the STB .

User responses can represent any detectable visual or audible response of the user determined from an exchange between the user and the avatar engine by way of the avatar . A response for example can represent a command such as Show me my DVR recordings Record this program Show me the EPG for HD channels Show me the VoD catalog for family movies Show me YouTube.com Show me contemporary music in iTunes What s the weather like outside What s the weather forecast for the next three days Where can I buy Spencer Tracy movies Please auction my five Spiderman comic books on eBay . Accept only bids that exceed 200 per comic book. You can find detailed information about each comic book and visual images in my Spiderman folder which you can use to display on eBay Please purchase a 3G iPhone on line if you find one with 16 Gbytes of memory and XXX features for less than 250 and so on.

The avatar engine thus can be programmed for example to identify in step from the user s responses a need to engage in an e commerce transaction. E commerce transactions can represent any commercial transaction for purchasing or selling goods or services over a communication system such as the Internet. In step the avatar engine can determine from the user s responses whether the transaction is a purchase or sale. If the transaction is a purchase the avatar engine can proceed to step where it can identify from the responses a good or service requested by the user . Assume for illustration purposes that the user has requested an on line purchase of the iPhone as described above. In step the avatar engine can search one or more merchant systems for the iPhone .

A merchant system in the present context can mean any on line system capable of engaging in e commerce transactions with other on line systems such as the avatar engine . Each of the merchant systems can define an Application Programming Interfaces API which can be made publically available so that programmers can program the avatar engine to engage in e commerce transactions without manual intervention as described below.

The search procedure employed by the avatar engine in step can be based on preferences supplied in the user profile of step and or observed behaviors of the user monitored by the avatar engine and recorded in a behavioral profile. The avatar engine can search for known sources for the iPhone such as AT T and Apple as well as search for ad hoc sources for the phone such as eBay . The avatar engine can determine from on line merchant systems managed by these sources which of the merchant systems offers the best price for the iPhone with the desired features outlined by the user. The avatar engine can also explore which merchant system can most reliably provide what the merchant system or sellers associated therewith as in the case of eBay is offering which merchant system provides the better money back guarantee which merchant system is able to combine a discount for phone services with a purchase of the iPhone and so on. Based on the observed behavior of the user from prior e commerce transactions the avatar engine can apply a weight of importance to these additional factors explored with each merchant system.

When the avatar engine determines that one of the merchant systems has an offer that stands out from the rest the avatar engine can proceed to step where it engages with said system in a commercial exchange. On the other hand if the avatar engine determines that more than one merchant system offers adequate deals for the iPhone then the avatar engine can present the user by way of the avatar the available options to purchase the phone accompanied with a request for instructions from the user. Under these circumstances the user can select a merchant from the options provided which can trigger the avatar engine to proceed to step as described above. Alternatively the user can select more than one merchant which can cause the avatar engine to negotiate with more than one merchant system contemporaneously. In yet another embodiment the user profile can be used by the avatar engine to identify preferred merchants a priority of merchants or a directive to randomly choose merchants when there is more than one adequate offer without disturbing the user .

Once the avatar engine has transitioned to step it can engage in a commercial exchange in any suitable manner that serves the best interests of the user . For example if the merchant system supports an auctioning process the avatar engine can offer a bid for the iPhone at a price that can be less than the price limit set by the user for example 200 . The avatar engine can then engage in a bidding exchange with the merchant system against others bidders vying for the purchase of the same product. If however the merchant system offers the iPhone at a fixed price the avatar engine can accept the price in step if it meets the user s criteria and proceed to step to consummate the purchase.

Once the merchant system and the avatar engine reach an agreed price at step the avatar engine retrieves payment information in step from a database or other suitable payment data source and supplies this information to the merchant system to complete the purchase. The payment information can represent credit card information bank account information or other suitable forms of payment data. To add security to the payment process the avatar engine can instead engage an intermediary payment system such as PayPal to fulfill the payment process without divulging sensitive information to the merchant system or its users.

Once the product has been purchased the avatar engine can generate a commercial status for the transaction and communicate said status in step by way of the avatar . The commercial status can notify the user that the good or service requested has been found that the good or service requested has been carried out or not and why and or that the merchant by way of the merchant system has proposed a purchase price that is beyond an agreed limit set by the user. The latter notification can occur if in step the avatar engine cannot reach agreement with the merchant system such as in a bidding process where the bids exceed the purchase price limit set by the user . In this instance the user can be notified by the avatar engine by way of the avatar and if desired the user can raise the limit thereby re engaging the avatar engine in the bidding process started at step .

Referring back to step the avatar engine can instead detect that the user wants to sell a good or service identified in step as for example the Spiderman comic book collectables. From the responses of the user the avatar engine can also determine whether the user wants to sell the goods or services at a fixed price or auction. Depending on this determination the avatar engine can identify one or more merchant systems from a random search preferences identified in the user profile or a behavioral profile generated by the avatar engine from historical observations of the user s behavior in prior e commerce transactions. For example the behavioral profile can identify eBay as a preferred merchant system of the user for auctions or fixed sale transactions. The user profile might however identify on line merchant systems specializing in comic book exchanges as a preference over a general purpose merchant system such as eBay .

Once the avatar engine identifies a merchant system in step according to the above determinations it can inform the merchant system of the parameters for the sale such as for example the fixed price to be offered a minimum price floor in an auction sale delivery charges warranty terms marketing images of the good or service offered that can be displayed by the merchant system and so on. In step the avatar engine can monitor offers received by the merchant system. The avatar engine accept or reject the offers in step . If a purchaser s offer is accepted the avatar engine can proceed to step where it awaits payment notification from the merchant system. Once payment notification is received the avatar engine can generate a commercial status for the transaction which is communicated to the user by way of the avatar in step . The commercial status can for example indicate that one or more of the comic books were sold the sale price of the items sold and an account balance after commission paid to the merchant system as well as other transactional expenses such as a sales tax.

If the offer is not accepted by the avatar engine because for example the offer is below the minimum price established by the user the avatar engine can proceed to step where it informs the user by way of the avatar of a counteroffer and awaits directions from the user. If the user accepts the counteroffer the avatar engine can direct the merchant system in step to accept the offer and consummate the sale.

Upon reviewing the aforementioned embodiments it would be evident to an artisan with ordinary skill in the art that said embodiments can be modified reduced or enhanced without departing from the scope and spirit of the claims described below. For example method can be applied to any communication device such as a computer STB cell phone IMS or VoIP phone communicatively coupled to the avatar engine .

In another embodiment the avatar engine can be integrated in any communication device. For example the avatar engine can be an integral part of the STB a mobile phone a PDA a gaming console a communication device of an IMS system such as shown in a portal and so on. Additionally the avatar engine can be distributed between devices. In this embodiment a portion of the avatar engine can operate in a network element of the iMCS while another portion operates in another communication device.

The computer system may further include a video display unit e.g. a liquid crystal display LCD a flat panel a solid state display or a cathode ray tube CRT . The computer system may include an input device e.g. a keyboard a cursor control device e.g. a mouse a disk drive unit a signal generation device e.g. a speaker or remote control and a network interface device .

The disk drive unit may include a machine readable medium on which is stored one or more sets of instructions e.g. software embodying any one or more of the methodologies or functions described herein including those methods illustrated above. The instructions may also reside completely or at least partially within the main memory the static memory and or within the processor during execution thereof by the computer system . The main memory and the processor also may constitute machine readable media.

Dedicated hardware implementations including but not limited to application specific integrated circuits programmable logic arrays and other hardware devices can likewise be constructed to implement the methods described herein. Applications that may include the apparatus and systems of various embodiments broadly include a variety of electronic and computer systems. Some embodiments implement functions in two or more specific interconnected hardware modules or devices with related control and data signals communicated between and through the modules or as portions of an application specific integrated circuit. Thus the example system is applicable to software firmware and hardware implementations.

In accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure the methods described herein are intended for operation as software programs running on a computer processor. Furthermore software implementations can include but not limited to distributed processing or component object distributed processing parallel processing or virtual machine processing can also be constructed to implement the methods described herein.

The present disclosure contemplates a machine readable medium containing instructions so that a device connected to a network environment can send or receive voice video or data and to communicate over the network using the instructions . The instructions may further be transmitted or received over a network via the network interface device .

While the machine readable medium is shown in an example embodiment to be a single medium the term machine readable medium should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media e.g. a centralized or distributed database and or associated caches and servers that store the one or more sets of instructions. The term machine readable medium shall also be taken to include any medium that is capable of storing encoding or carrying a set of instructions for execution by the machine and that cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the present disclosure.

The term machine readable medium shall accordingly be taken to include but not be limited to solid state memories such as a memory card or other package that houses one or more read only non volatile memories random access memories or other re writable volatile memories magneto optical or optical medium such as a disk or tape and or a digital file attachment to e mail or other self contained information archive or set of archives is considered a distribution medium equivalent to a tangible storage medium. Accordingly the disclosure is considered to include any one or more of a machine readable medium or a distribution medium as listed herein and including art recognized equivalents and successor media in which the software implementations herein are stored.

Although the present specification describes components and functions implemented in the embodiments with reference to particular standards and protocols the disclosure is not limited to such standards and protocols. Each of the standards for Internet and other packet switched network transmission e.g. TCP IP UDP IP HTML HTTP represent examples of the state of the art. Such standards are periodically superseded by faster or more efficient equivalents having essentially the same functions. Accordingly replacement standards and protocols having the same functions are considered equivalents.

The illustrations of embodiments described herein are intended to provide a general understanding of the structure of various embodiments and they are not intended to serve as a complete description of all the elements and features of apparatus and systems that might make use of the structures described herein. Many other embodiments will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reviewing the above description. Other embodiments may be utilized and derived therefrom such that structural and logical substitutions and changes may be made without departing from the scope of this disclosure. Figures are also merely representational and may not be drawn to scale. Certain proportions thereof may be exaggerated while others may be minimized. Accordingly the specification and drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.

Such embodiments of the inventive subject matter may be referred to herein individually and or collectively by the term invention merely for convenience and without intending to voluntarily limit the scope of this application to any single invention or inventive concept if more than one is in fact disclosed.
