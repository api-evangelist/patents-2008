title: Use of dermatan sulfates and/or desulfated heparins to treat or prevent heparinoid-induced autoimmune responses
abstract: Dermatan sulfates and/or O-desulfated heparins useful in treating and preventing heparinoid-induced autoimmune responses, in particular heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and its associated disease states. The dermatan sulfates comprise repeating disulfated and/or trisulfated disaccharide units of L-iduronic acid and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine. The O-desulfated heparins comprise heparin molecules selectively O-desulfated at the 2-O and/or 3-O positions of the uronic acid and glucosamine saccharide residues. Particularly effective dermatan sulfate HIT antagonists have a mean molecular weight of from about 2000 to about 10,000 Daltons.

This application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 11 132 317 filed May 19 2005 now abandoned which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 572 364 filed May 19 2004. The entire disclosure and contents of the above applications are hereby incorporated by reference.

This invention was made in part with Government support under Grant No. HL 66 646 01 and HL 70 453 01 awarded by the National Institute of Health National Heart Lung Blood Institute. The Government may have certain rights to the invention.

The present invention relates to treating and or preventing heparinoid induced autoimmune responses with certain dermatan sulfates and or certain O desulfated heparins. The present application particularly relates to the treatment and or prevention of heparin induced thrombocytopenia HIT and its associated disease states with certain dermatan sulfate and or certain O desulfated heparin HIT antagonists.

Heparin and related heparinoids are sulfated mucopolysaccharides that belong to the family of glycosaminoglycans GAGs . Over one trillion units of heparin are administered to 12 million patients annually in the United States for the prevention and treatment of thrombo embolic diseases. See Fahey Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia. . 1995 13 112 116 http www.argatroban.com ref 01htm 2004. Cardiovascular related thrombo embolic diseases are among the leading causes of death in the United States. With perhaps the exception of stroke the most widely prescribed anticoagulant for the prevention and treatment of these diseases is heparin. Heparin is ubiquitous throughout hospitals and is used routinely to keep all intravenous and other access lines to the patient from clotting.

While bleeding is a well understood side effect of heparin its use is also associated with a drug induced autoimmune hypersensitivity response that paradoxically predisposes the patient to develop severe thrombocytopenia and thrombosis and is typically referred to as heparin induced thrombocytopenia HIT . The cardiology patient e.g. a patient undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery is particularly predisposed to HIT because multiple exposures to heparin can occur prior to surgery that sensitize the patient to the high doses of heparin required to suppress the massive hypercoagulation response to surgery. See Bauer et al. Prevalence of Heparin Associated Antibodies without Thrombosis in Patients Undergoing Cardiopulmonary Bypass Surgery 1997 95 1242 46 Pouplard et al. Antibodies to Platelet Factor 4 Heparin After Cardiopulmonary Bypass in Patients Anticoagulated with Unfractionated Heparin or a Low Molecular Weight Heparin Clinical Implications for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia 1999 99 2536 39 Trossaert et al. High Incidence of Anti Heparin Platelet Factor 4 Antibodies After Cardiopulmonary Bypass surgery . 1998 101 4 653 55 Utley Cardiopulmonary Bypass Surgery . 1992 7 2 267 75.

Approximately 2 5 of all patients in the U.S. exposed to heparin develop an antibody mediated hypersensitivity to heparin with associated thrombocytopenia referred to as Type II HIT with a significantly greater percentage developing antibodies without thrombocytopenia. See Wallis et al. Failure of Early Heparin Cessation as Treatment for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia . 1999 106 6 629 635 Warkentin et al. A 14 Year Study of Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia . 1996 101 502 507 Brieger et al. Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia . 1998 31 1449 1459. HIT disease can range from clinically insignificant to extremely severe. In contrast to the hemorrhagic thrombocytopenia disease states HIT is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. Historically about 40 of these HIT patients develop a life threatening thrombosis or HITT syndrome that produces devastating complications including necrosis of the extremities stroke myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism. See Pouplard et al supra Trossaert et al supra. Morbidity rates among HIT patients can reach as high as 61 including a limb amputation rate of approximately 20 and an overall mortality rate of approximately 30 . See Silver et al. Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia Thrombosis and Hemorrhage . 1983 198 301 306 King et al. Heparin Associated Thrombocytopenia . 1984 100 535 40 Utley supra Wallis et al. supra.

HIT can occur relatively rapidly after exposure to heparin. In a recent study the onset of HIT occurred on or after day 4 of heparin therapy in 70 of patients an even more rapid onset of HIT occurred in 30 of these patients i.e. after 10.5 hours of heparin exposure. See Warkentin et al Temporal Aspects of Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia . 2001 344 1286 1292. Diagnosis is often based on a decline in platelet numbers and the exclusion of other causes of thrombocytopenia.

The prothrombotic state of HIT is caused in part by an immunologic reaction to heparin exposure that promotes platelet activation antecedent to thrombocytopenia and thrombosis. The immunological response to heparin exposure may also damage the endothelial cells that form the vascular lining and induce Tissue Factor expression in monocytes thereby further enhancing the procoagulant state. See Visentin et al. Antibodies from Patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia Thrombosis Are Specific for Platelet Factor 4 Complexed with Heparin or Bound to Endothelial Cells . 1994 93 81 88 Blank et al. Anti Platelet Factor 4 Heparin Antibodies from Patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia Provoke Direct Activation of Microvascular Endothelial Cells . 2002 14 121 29 Pouplard et al. Induction of Monocyte Tissue Factor Expression by Antibodies to Heparin Platelet Factor 4 Complexes Developed in Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia 2001 97 3300 302.

Platelet activation is caused by an interaction of the heparinoid induced immune complexes with the Fc IIa receptor on the cell surface. The major factors eliciting platelet activation with sera of HIT type II patients have previously been attributed to the degree of sulfation and molecular weight of the GAG and not the type of glycosidic linkage of the oligosaccharide or the antithrombin III binding capacity of the GAG. Branched glucan sulfates form immune complexes with patient sera and activate platelets at lower concentrations than linear glucan sulfates. The suggested optimal size GAG for HIT antigen formation immune complex formation and subsequent platelet activation is a hexadecasaccharide of 4800 Daltons. See Greinacher et al. Heparin Associated Thrombocytopenia the Antibody Is Not Heparin Specific . 1992 67 545 549 Greinacher et al. Characterization of the Structural Requirements for a Carbohydrate Based Anticoagulant with a Reduced Risk of Inducing the Immunological Type of Heparin Associated Thrombocytopenia . 1995 74 886 892. Thus it has been previously concluded that hyper or oversulfation of GAGs is an inappropriate approach to anticoagulation based on the HIT inducing potential of sulfated GAGs and that to reduce the ability of a GAG to induce a HIT response i the nature of the glycosidic bond is unimportant ii the molecule should be unbranched iii the molecule should have a degree of sulfation i.e. the number of sulfate groups monosaccharide of less than 0.60 i.e. a sulfate to carboxylate S C ratio of no more than 1.2 for chain lengths greater than 10 monosaccharides i.e. greater than 3000 Daltons iv the molecule should be smaller than 2400 Daltons if its degree of sulfation is 1.0 1.3 and v the therapeutic concentration should not exceed 0.12 g ml if the degree of sulfation is greater than 0.6 and the chain length greater than 2400 Daltons. See Greinacher et al. Characterization of the Structural Requirements for a Carbohydrate Based Anticoagulant with a Reduced Risk of Inducing the Immunological Type of Heparin Associated Thrombocytopenia . 1995 74 886 92.

The antigenic complexes formed in HIT are comprised of heparin and releasable platelet proteins predominantly platelet factor 4 PF4 a platelet specific heparin binding protein. See Greinacher et al. Heparin Associated Thrombocytopenia Isolation of the Antibody and Characterization of a Multimolecular PF4 Heparin Complex as Major Antigen . 1994 71 247 51. Heparin and PF4 molecules assemble into a multimolecular antigenic complex. The binding of PF4 to heparin induces the formation of antigenic domains or neoepitopes on the PF4 surface that elicit an antibody mediated immune response. See Li et al. Defining a Second Epitope for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia Thrombosis Antibodies Using KKO a Murine HIT like Monoclonal Antibody 2002 99 1230 36. The immune response is polyclonal and polyspecific with at least three neoepitopes identified based on immunoreactivity studies. See Suh et al. Antibodies from Patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia Thrombosis Recognize Different Epitopes on Heparin Platelet Factor 4 1998 91 916 22.

Antigenic complexes reactive to HIT antibodies can be formed between a variety of negatively charged polyanions and platelet proteins in vitro and in vivo. See U.S. Pat. No. 5 972 718 Moghaddam et al. issued Oct. 26 1999 which discloses the formation of antigenic neoepitopes comprised of polymers bound to PF4 reactive with HIT antibodies where the polymers can be polyvinyl sulfonate polystyrene sulfonate polyanetholesulfonate polyvinyl phosphate polyvinyl phosphonate or polyvinyl sulfate comprised of 10 60 subunits having molecular weights between 2000 and 6000 U.S. Pat. No. 5 972 717 Aster et al. issued Oct. 26 1999 which discloses the formation of antigenic neoepitopes reactive with HIT antibodies in which the complexes expressing the antigenic neoepitopes are comprised of PF4 or peptides of PF4 bound to heparin heparin fragments heparin salts heparamine metallic heparinates heparin sulfate chondroitin sulfate dermatan sulfate and keratan sulfates having preferably 10 20 saccharide residues U.S. Pat. No. 5 466 582 Amiral issued Nov. 14 1995 which discloses the formation of antigenic neoepitopes reactive with HIT antibodies in which the complexes expressing the antigenic neoepitopes are comprised of PF4 or peptides of PF4 bound to heparin metal heparinates heparinoids and heparin fragments where the heparin fragments have an average molecular weight of less than 6000 Daltons the heparinoids being selected from the class of heparamine and chondroitin sulfates. Twenty monosaccharides approximately 6000 Daltons of chondroitin sulfate represents the minimal chain length that binds PF4 whereas the affinity of chondroitin sulfate for PF4 increases with increased content of the disulfated disaccharide 4 GlcA 1 3GalNAc 4 6 O sulfate 1 . See Petersen et al. Characterization of a Neutrophil Cell Surface Glycosaminoglycan that Mediates Binding of Platelet Factor 4. 1999 274 12376 82. However increased sulfation of chondroitin sulfate induces antibodies cross reactive with the PF4 heparin complex thrombocytopenia and thrombosis. See Greinacher et al. Heparin Associated Thrombocytopenia in a Patient Treated with Polysulphated Chondroitin Sulphate Evidence for Immunological Crossreactivity between Heparin and Polysulphated Glycosaminoglycan . 1992 81 252 54.

Treatment of HIT usually involves heparin withdrawal and sometimes transfusion. Even so the failure of early heparin cessation as a treatment for HIT has led to the approval of several direct thrombin inhibitors as alternative anticoagulants. Patients who are positive for the immune complex of heparin IgG PF4 or are subject to platelet loss or thrombosis while on heparin therapy are candidates for alternative anticoagulant therapies. Presently the thrombin inhibitors ACOVA argatroban and Refludan recombinant hirudin are approved for the treatment of HIT HITT where heparin is contraindicated. These drugs however have narrow therapeutic indices lack antidotes and require laboratory monitoring. Even with the use of these approved drugs circulating immune complexes may persist for days to weeks and continue to promote the immunohematologic prothrombotic state because these direct thrombin inhibitors do not eliminate all thrombosis associated with HIT. See Bauer et al. supra http www.argatroban.com ref0.1htm 2004 supra Walenga et al. Combined Thrombin and Platelet Inhibition Treatment for HIT Patients 1999 19 128 33 Greinacher et al. Lepirudin Recombinant Hirudin for Parenteral Anticoagulation in Patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia 1999 100 6 587 93. As such the predisposition to life threatening thrombosis in HIT is neither predictable nor adequately addressed by the alternative use of these direct thrombin inhibitors. Accordingly despite the use of these alternatives the morbidity and mortality of HIT patients remains relatively high and will likely remain so until a therapy is developed that treats the root cause of this disease initiated by the formation and action of the immune complexes in HIT which adversely modulate the functions of platelets endothelial cells and monocytes.

One embodiment of this invention is broadly directed at the treatment and or prevention of heparinoid induced autoimmune responses in particular heparin induced thrombocytopenia HIT and its associated disease states by using certain dermatan sulfates as well as certain O desulfated heparins separately or in combination as heparinoid induced autoimmune response antagonists and especially as HIT antagonists. The dermatan sulfates of this invention comprise repeating disulfated and or trisulfated disaccharide units of L iduronic acid and N acetyl D galactosamine and have the following properties 1 for at least about 80 of the polysaccharides a molecular weight in the range of from about 1200 to about 35 000 Daltons 2 a sulfur content in the range of from about 6 to about 11 3 a sulfate carboxylate ratio S C in the range of from about 1.2 to about 2.0 4 a combined disulfated and trisulfated disaccharide content in the range of from about 20 to 100 by weight of the total disaccharide content 5 less than about 20 platelet activation activity in the presence of HIT immune sera HIT sera or anti heparin PF4 antibody HIT antibody and 6 an ability to inhibit the activation of human platelets caused by HIT reactive sulfated glycosaminoglycans GAGs such as heparin in the presence of either HIT sera or HIT antibody.

The O desulfated heparins of this invention comprise heparin molecules selectively O desulfated at the 2O and or 3 O positions of the uronic acid and glucosamine saccharide residue i.e. to provide 2 O and or 3 O desulfated heparins. These O desulfated heparins have the following properties 1 an average molecular weight in the range of from about 2000 to about 14 000 Daltons 2 a sulfate carboxylate ratio S C in the range of from about 1.2 to about 1.5 3 a residue on ignition in the range of from about 28 to about 41 4 a nitrogen content in the range of from about 1.3 to about 2.5 calculated on a dried basis 5 a USP antifactor Xa potency of less than about 10 units mg 6 a USP heparin potency of less than about 10 units mg 7 about 50 or greater inhibitory activity against human leukocyte elastase activity at ratios of O desulfated heparin elastase of from about 0.5 to about 1.0 8 less than about 20 platelet activation activity in the presence of HIT sera or HIT antibody and 9 an ability to inhibit the activation of platelets caused by HIT reactive sulfated GAGs such as heparin in the presence of either HIT sera or HIT antibody.

Another embodiment of this invention is broadly directed at the treatment and or prevention of heparinoid induced autoimmune responses in particular HIT and its associated disease states by using certain lower molecular weight dermatan sulfates as heparinoid induced autoimmune response antagonists and especially as HIT antagonists. These lower molecular weight dermatan sulfates comprise repeating disulfated and or trisulfated disaccharide units of L iduronic acid and N acetyl D galactosamine and have the following properties 1 a mean molecular weight in the range of from about 2000 to about 10 000 Daltons 2 a sulfur content in the range from about 6.0 to about 11 3 a sulfate carboxylate ratio S C in the range of from about 1.2 to about 2.0 4 a combined disulfated and trisulfated disaccharide content in the range of from about 20 to 100 by weight of the total disaccharide content 5 less than about 20 platelet activation activity in the presence of HIT sera or HIT antibody and 6 an ability to inhibit the activation of platelets caused by HIT reactive sulfated GAGs such as heparin in the presence of either HIT sera or HIT antibody.

Direct thrombin inhibitors do not block the activation of platelets caused by complexes of heparin platelet proteins and HIT antibodies. While the combined use of a heparin cofactor II agonist such as dermatan sulfate and various oversulfated derivatives thereof with a GPIIb IIIa receptor antagonist have been taught to inhibit thrombin in various thromboembolic disease states including HIT see commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6 518 244 Cardin et al. issued Feb. 11 2003 it has been surprisingly found that the dermatan sulfates of this invention by themselves and substantially in the absence of such GPIIb IIIa receptor antagonists unexpectedly block the platelet activation otherwise caused by immune complexes comprised of heparin platelet proteins and HIT antibodies even when substantially in the absence of thrombin. The dermatan sulfates of this invention have been found to disrupt the platelet activation process caused by the immune complexes of HIT thus abating this disease at its immunological root cause. Also surprising and unexpected is that the potency of this HIT antagonist activity is enhanced by increasing the degree of sulfation and decreasing the molecular weight of these dermatan sulfates and that this antagonist activity is independent of both glucuronate content and thrombin inhibitory activity.

It has been further surprisingly found that selective O desulfation of heparin at the 2 O and or 3 O positions of the uronic acid and glucosamine sugar residues leads to O desulfated heparin chains with molecular weights typically greater than 2400 Daltons and S C ratios greater than about 1.0 that while able to form complexes with platelet proteins are unable to promote the formation of functional HIT like immune complexes with anti heparinoid antibodies that are capable of activating platelets. Not only do the O desulfated heparins of this invention not form functional autoimmune complexes but instead block the activation of platelets caused by heparin when in the presence of platelet proteins and heparinoid induced immune sera from HIT patients and substantially lacking thrombin activity.

The dermatan sulfates and or O desulfated heparins of this invention unexpectedly prevent the activation of platelets and endothelial cell damage caused by the immune complexes of HIT even in the presence of administered heparin a property or activity referred to as HIT antagonism. The HIT antagonist properties of the dermatan sulfates and or O desulfated heparins of this invention provide a therapeutic modality that not only suppress the autoimmune responses that propagate HIT and its associated disease states by disrupting the communication of immune complexes with platelets and endothelial cells but also potentially suppresses other disease states that can interfere with the function and longevity of medical devices that interact with or are exposed to blood.

The dermatan sulfates and or O desulfated heparins of this invention are useful in the prevention and or treatment of conditions that occur in response to heparinoid e.g. heparin exposure including elevated immune complexes heparin induced platelet activation thrombocytopenia the evolution of HIT specific platelet related thrombosis caused by early platelet activation due to these immune complexes henceforth thrombosis endothelial cell damage due to heparinoid induced autoimmune responses as well as the functional impairment of medical devices that are coated with heparinoids or otherwise come into contact with blood where the antigenic complexes of HIT and their immune complexes can form deposit and potentially build up such as on stents catheters vascular grafts extracoporeal devices such as heart lung machines oxygenators hemodialysis circuits filters and membranes etc. and especially create vascular access obstructions e.g. in end stage renal dialysis patients who are routinely exposed to heparin during maintenance hemodialysis . The dermatan sulfates of this invention are also useful in combination with heparin lyases heparinases such as heparin lyases I II and III that degrade heparin to reverse its effects but without affecting the ability of the dermatan sulfates of this invention to treat and or prevent heparinoid induced autoimmune responses especially HIT.

The nonanticoagulant O desulfated heparins of this invention are also useful when administered to patients suffering from heparinoid induced autoimmune responses who may be maintained on heparin anticoagulation or alternatively are anticoagulated by the administration of inhibitors of either thrombin or activated Factor X FXa including for example DX 9065c Daiichi Pharm. Ltd. BAY59 7939 Bayer fondaparinux hirudin Refludan bivalirudin Angiomax argatroban Argatroban etc.

The chemical physical and physiological properties of the dermatan sulfates including the LMWDS embodiments of this invention can be determined by the following methods 

The dermatan sulfates of this invention can be prepared by the oversulfation of native dermatan sulfate. For example these dermatan sulfates can be prepared by sulfation of native dermatan sulfate using a sulfur trioxide trimethylamine complex in a suitable organic solvent such as formamide. Methods of preparing such dermatan sulfates are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 922 690 Van Gorp et al. issued Jul. 13 1999 which is incorporated by reference and which describes oversulfation of native dermatan sulfate to provide yields of greater than about 75 4 6 di O sulfated species species having lower and higher degrees of sulfation can also be useful herein and can be obtained by optimizing reaction conditions appropriately by techniques well known to those skilled in the art. More extensive sulfation to include other sites can also be desirable. See Pav o et al. Highly Sulfated Dermatan Sulfates from Ascidians Structure versus Anticoagulant Activity of these Glycosaminoglycans . 1998 273 27848 57 which is incorporated by reference. Optimization of the HIT antagonist properties can be realized by varying such parameters as reactant chemistries that include the use of quaternary salts to mask or restrict and therefore to control or redirect sulfation sites as well as the extent of sulfation in a organic solvent medium by varying the ratio of reactants by varying the reaction temperatures and times and the like. These sulfation products can be further fractionated for example by ion exchange methods to obtain mixtures that differ in their degree of sulfation and therefore their HIT antagonist properties. Native dermatan sulfate itself can also be fractionated by such methods to yield higher sulfated mixtures having HIT antagonist properties as previously described. Alternatively the dermatan sulfates of this invention can be obtained by de novo synthesis using protection deprotection strategies well known to those skilled in the art of solution and solid phase synthesis chemistries.

The LMWDS embodiments of this invention can be prepared by any number of approaches including but not limited to i the oversulfation of native dermatan sulfate followed by controlled depolymerization ii controlled depolymerization of native dermatan sulfate followed by oversulfation of the fragments iii depolymerization of native dermatan sulfate followed by the enrichment of the di and tri sulfated disaccharide containing oligosaccharide species by ion exchange fractionation and iv synthesis in solution or on solid phase supports such resins. Depolymerization of native dermatan sulfate or oversulfated dermatan sulfate can be achieved by a variety of techniques well known to those skilled in the art including but not limited to v periodate oxidation followed by borohydride reduction and acid hydrolysis vi elimination of a benzyl esterified dermatan sulfate or oversulfated dermatan or other suitable ester in an alkaline media from which the ester is prepared from its respective quaternary ammonium salt e.g. benzethonium dermatan vii peroxidative depolymerization viii nitrous acid degradation ix the action of chondroitinase enzymes x gamma irradiation or xi suitable combinations of methods v x .

3. Uses of Dermatan Sulfate and or O Desulfated Heparins Methods for Administering and Pharmaceutical Compositions Containing Same

The dermatan sulfates and or O desulfated heparins of this invention are useful in the treatment of patients having or potentially susceptible to heparinoid induced immune responses such as HIT and its associated disease states e.g. conditions of elevated immune complexes that occur in response to heparin exposure with or without associated thrombosis and even when administered substantially in the absence of a platelet glycoprotein IIb IIIa receptor antagonist. The dermatan sulfates and or O desulfated heparins of this invention are also useful in blocking the ability of antigenic complexes comprised of heparin platelet proteins and other HIT antibodies to activate human platelets as measured by SRA.

More specifically the dermatan sulfates and or O desulfated heparins of this invention are useful therapeutically for the treatment and or prevention of disease states characterized by an autoimmune response to heparin and other heparinoid therapies where the afflicted patient experiences a rise in antibodies reactive to antigenic complexes of heparin or other heparinoids and associated platelet proteins where the condition can progress to a pronounced thrombocytopenia typically characterized clinically as a greater than about 50 fall in platelet numbers or a nadir count of less than about 100 000 l. The dermatan sulfates and or O desulfated heparins of this invention have particular efficacy in treating the underlying cause of HIT by suppressing the activation of platelets endothelial cells or monocytes caused by circulating and bound immune complexes comprised of heparin platelet proteins and HIT antibodies thereby reducing the immunoreactive inflammatory and procoagulant states of HIT characterized by activation of platelets endothelium monocytes and thrombin generation known to be elevated in HIT as well as treating and or preventing vascular access obstruction associated with such immune complexes comprised of heparin platelet proteins and anti heparin antibodies experienced by for example hemodialysis patients.

The dermatan sulfates and or O desulfated heparins of this invention can be administered in any manner suitable to deliver the active ingredient s to the patient and or medical device to treat and or prevent heparinoid induced autoimmune responses by reaching the antigenic and receptor sites of the patient or the surfaces of medical devices that interact with or are exposed to blood from a patient who is also exposed to heparinoids that can promulgate a systemic or localized disease process or device impairment or failure s . Thus the dermatan sulfates and or O desulfated heparins of this invention may be administered in the presence of heparinoids or administered with heparin in those situations where heparin administration alone is otherwise contraindicated.

In the case of medical devices the dermatan sulfate sulfates and or O desulfated heparins of this invention can be used to treat the device before or after exposure of the patient to the heparinoids. The medical devices can also be provided with a source of the dermatan sulfates and or O desulfated heparins of this invention to be delivered to the device to minimize or prevent such impairment. For example the medical device can be coated with the dermatan sulfates and or O desulfated heparins of this invention e.g. as a sustained release coating of the dermatan sulfates to minimize or prevent the aftermath of heparinoid induced autoimmune responses from eventually clogging fouling or otherwise obstructing the device and thus causing impairment or failure thereof.

For administration to patients e.g. humans the dermatan sulfates and or O desulfated heparins of this invention can be in the form of injectable or oral compositions for administration. Suitable injectable compositions for use in this invention can be given intravenously parenterally intramuscularly or subcutaneously and include bolus or extended infusion compositions. Injectable administration of the dermatan sulfates and or O desulfated heparins of this invention typically involves the preparation of suitable infusion solutions according to procedures well known to those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts. Administration in these various ways are suitable as long as the beneficial pharmaceutical effect of the dermatan sulfates and or O desulfated heparins of this invention is realized by the patient. Such beneficial effect is usually achieved when the target plasma level concentrations of the active drug are maintained. Such target plasma level concentrations can be readily determined for each patient by physicians and veterinarians skilled in the art.

The dosage regimen for the dermatan sulfate and or O desulfated heparins is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including type species age weight sex and medical condition of the patient the severity of the condition to be treated or prevented the routes of administration the renal and hepatic function of the patient and the particular dermatan sulfate and or O desulfated heparin to be used. An ordinarily skilled physician or veterinarian can readily determine and prescribe the therapeutically effective amount of the dermatan sulfate and or O desulfated heparin required to prevent counter or arrest the progress of the heparinoid induced autoimmune response condition or disease state such as HIT. For example in the case of LMWDS HIT antagonists of this invention therapeutic doses will typically be in the range of from about 0.1 to about 250 mg kg as an intravenous or subcutaneous bolus followed by a maintenance intravenous infusion as is needed of from about 5 to about 600 microg kg min.

The dermatan sulfates and or O desulfated heparins of this invention can be administered in admixture with suitable pharmaceutical diluents excipients or carriers collectively referred to hereinafter as pharmaceutical carriers suitably selected with respect to the intended form of administration such as oral tablets capsules elixirs syrups and the like and consistent with conventional pharmaceutical practices. See for example Remington 2000 20Ed. Mack Publishing Company herein incorporated by reference for suitable pharmaceutical carriers well known to those skilled in the art. Injectable compositions suitable for use in this invention are well known to those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts. For example injectable compositions can include aqueous solutions syrups aqueous or oil suspensions and emulsions with edible oil including cottonseed oil or peanut oil. Suitable dispersing or suspending agents for aqueous suspensions include synthetic or natural gums such as tragacanth alginate acacia dextran sodium carboxymethyl cellulose gelatin methylcellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone. These injectable compositions can include a sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solvent in particular water isotonic saline isotonic glucose solution buffer solution or other solvent conveniently used for parenteral administration of active pharmaceutical ingredients or can be provided as a sterile freeze dried powder which is readily dissolved in a sterile medium immediately prior to use. The injectable compositions of this invention can be formulated as long acting depot preparations for subcutaneous or intramuscular implantation and can include suitable polymeric or hydrophobic emulsions in the pharmaceutical carrier.

Typically suitable injectable e.g. intravenous solutions include pharmaceutically acceptable pH buffers e.g. sodium citrate tonicity adjusting agents and other components providing a storage stable and therapeutically effective injectable solution. Tonicity adjusting agents including sodium chloride are used to adjust tonicity for osmotic pressure and to prevent blood cell lysing. These agents minimize pain and thrombophlebitis often experienced by patients receiving intravenous administrations of pharmaceutical compositions. The amount used is that which makes the formulation isotonic with the osmotic pressure of the biological system of the patient. Expressed in osmolarity units the preferred amounts of tonicity adjusting agent suitable for use in the present invention e.g. sodium chloride are from about 50 to about 500 milliosmoles more preferably about 290 milliosmoles. For injectable compositions pharmaceutically acceptable osmolarity can be achieved by formulating with an amount of sodium chloride of from about 1.5 to about 15 mg ml preferably about 9 mg ml. Such osmolality can also be achieved by using an amount of mannitol of from about 7 to about 75 mg ml preferably about 50 mg ml. Other tonicity adjusting agents which can be used to adjust tonicity include but are not limited to dextrose and other sugars. These injectable compositions can also be suitable for long term storage in glass containers commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry e.g. in concentrated form in standard USP Type borosilicate glass containers.

In general the method for preparing injectable compositions comprising the dermatan sulfate and or O desulfated heparin involves combining the various ingredients in a mixing vessel e.g. at room temperature. The active ingredients in salt or free base form buffers sources e.g. citric acid and sodium citrate and tonicity adjusting agent s are combined to obtain an active ingredient concentration typically in the range of from about 0.01 mg ml to about 1 mg ml. In one embodiment for preparing such compositions a substantial portion of the finished product amount of water for example from about 60 to 100 is introduced into a standard pharmaceutical mixing vessel. An amount of the dermatan sulfate and or O desulfated heparin suitable for obtaining the desired finished product concentration is dissolved in the water. Amounts of sodium citrate and citric acid sufficient to obtain a finished citrate concentration of from about 2 to about 20 mM are added. A pharmaceutically acceptable amount of tonicity adjusting agent in the isotonic range is added. Any remaining portion of water is then added to achieve the desired final concentrations of ingredients. The amount of water initially used in preparing the formulation and the amount of the remaining portion of water added at the end of the procedure does not affect the properties of the finished product. Such amounts are a matter of choice for those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts allowing for pH adjustment during formulation. Concentrated formulations of these injectable compositions can be diluted at the time of administration with a suitable diluent to obtain a finished concentration for example of about 0.05 mg ml which is suitable for transfer to an infusion bag and use by a patient in need of the treatment.

The dermatan sulfates and or O desulfated heparins of this invention that are orally active can be administered as oral dose forms as tablets capsules including sustained or controlled release formulations pills powders granules elixirs tinctures suspensions syrups and emulsions can be administered one or more times during the day e.g. one two three or four times daily. For oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule the dermatan sulfate can be combined with an oral non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier such as lactose starch sucrose glucose methyl cellulose magnesium stearate dicalcium phosphate calcium sulfate mannitol sorbitol and the like. For oral administration in liquid form the oral drug components can be combined with any oral non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol glycerol water and the like. Suitable carriers for oral administration include but are not limited to amino acid compounds of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 650 386 Leone Bay et al. issued Jul. 22 1997 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 965 121 Leone Bay et al. issued Oct. 12 1999 both of which are incorporated by reference. Moreover when desired or necessary suitable binders lubricants disintegrating agents and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include starch gelatin natural sugars such as glucose or lactose corn sweeteners natural and synthetic gums such as acacia tragacanth or sodium alginate carboxymethylcellulose polyethylene glycol waxes and the like. Lubricants used in these dosage forms include sodium oleate sodium stearate magnesium stearate sodium benzoate sodium acetate sodium chloride and the like. Disintegrators include without limitation starch methyl cellulose agar bentonite xanthan gum and the like.

Oral compositions with enteric coatings can be prepared by mixing the dermatan sulfate and or O desulfated heparin with an excipient to form a spheroid and coating the spheroid with a thin polymer film. For example the dermatan sulfate and or O desulfated heparin can be mixed with non water swellable microcrystalline cellulose to form a spheroid which is then coated with a film of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose phthalate and or a plasticizer which prevents any release of the active ingredient in the stomach. When the composition reaches the intestine the dermatan sulfate and or O desulfated heparins is then released. Other suitable materials for enteric coatings include for example hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate succinate hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose hexahydrophthalate shellac cellulose acetate cellulose acetate phthalate polyvinyl acetate phthalate carboxymethyl ethyl cellulose methacrylic acid copolymers methacrylic ester copolymers and the like.

Oral compositions can also be prepared by mixing the dermatan sulfate and or O desulfated heparin with a wetting agent such as fatty acid esters lecithin sucrose mannitol or sorbitol and then spheronizing or granulating the mixture into microgranules. These are then coated with a microporous membrane polymer such as Eudragit E30D Rohm Pharma GmbH Weiterstadt Germany hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose phthalate and other wetting agents plasticizers and the like. These formulations are enteric by nature and the dermatan sulfate does not become bioavailable until the system reaches the intestine.

Oral compositions can also be prepared by mixing the dermatan sulfate and or O desulfated heparin and an acid such as fumaric or tartaric acid which is compressed into a spherical tablet and coated with lacquers that are insoluble in gastric juices but soluble in intestinal juices. These lacquers include copolymers of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid esters. The acidic matrix prevents quick dissolution early and yet promotes the active ingredient s bioavailability further downstream in the digestive tract.

Oral compositions can also be prepared by coating a solid dosage form of the dermatan sulfate and or O desulfated heparin with hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose phthalate or acidic succinyl and acetyl esters of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose. Triethylcitrate is added as a plasticizer which aids in the binding of the coating material to the core pellet. The coating resists dissolution in the stomach but completely dissolves in the small intestine.

In general solid dosage forms comprising the dermatan sulfate and or O desulfated heparin can be coated using conventional coating techniques such as conventional pan coating techniques or column spray coating techniques. See PCT application WO 99 38827 Cook et al. published Aug. 5 1999 herein incorporated by reference for a more detailed description of these techniques. The dermatan sulfate and or O desulfated heparin can also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems such as small unilamellar vesicles large unilamellar vesicles and multilamellar vesicles. The liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipids such as cholesterol stearylamine or phophatidylcholines. The dermatan sulfate and or O desulfated heparin can also be delivered using monoclonal antibodies as individual carriers to which the active ingredient molecules are coupled or the active ingredients can be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. These soluble polymers include polyvinylpyrrolidone pyran copolymer polyhydroxy propyl methacrylamide phenol polyhydroxy ethyl aspartamide phenol or polyethyleneoxide polylysine substituted with palmitoyl residues. In addition the active ingredients can be coupled to biodegradable polymers that control the release of the active ingredient for example polylactic acid polyglycolic acid copolymers of polylactic and polyglycolic acid polyepsilon caprolactone polyhydroxy butyric acid polyorthoesters polyacetals polydihydropyrans polycynacrylates and cross linked or amphiphatic block copolymers of hydrogels.

The dermatan sulfate and or O desulfated heparin can also be formulated as ocular eye drops. See PCT application WO 99 38827 Cook et al. published Aug. 5 1999 herein incorporated by reference for a more detailed description of the other ingredients in ocular eye drop formulations suitable dosing schemes for such formulations and methods for preparing such formulations. Suitable eyedrop formulations are those which are isotonic and maintain sufficient contact with the eye surface to systemically deliver the active ingredient to the patient. The ocular preparation can be a solid insert such as one which after dispensing the active ingredient remains essentially intact or a bioerodible insert that is soluble in lacrimal fluids or otherwise disintegrates. See PCT application WO 99 38827 Cook et al. published Aug. 5 1999 herein incorporated by reference for a more detailed description of solid insert embodiments. The ocular preparation can also be in the form of an ointment which is compounded for example by mixing finely milled powdered ingredients with a small amount of petrolatum e.g. white petrolatum and levigating or otherwise mixing until a uniform distribution is achieved with the balance of the petrolatum being added by geometric addition until the desired dosage form is made.

The dermatan sulfate and or O desulfated heparin can also be formulated for intranasal delivery. See Mousa et al. Intranasal Antiplatelet Antithrombotic Efficacy of a Novel Platelet GPIIB IIIA Receptor Antagonist DMP755. 1998 92 115 124 which is incorporated by reference. The dermatan sulfate and or O desulfated heparin can also be formulated for delivery through a transdermal patch or as a rectal suppository.

The dermatan sulfates and or O desulfated heparins of this invention with or without additional actives such as heparin lyase can also be formulated as a therapeutic composition or packaged drug product that is provided with a set of instructions for administering the composition drug to treat a patient in need thereof. The set of instructions can be written or printed on a sheet of paper can be on the packaging associated with the packaged drug e.g. on the package label can be in the form of electronic media or software e.g. in the form of a floppy disk s CD ROM disk s or other non volatile electronic storage media that can be loaded installed directly or by downloading from a remote site such as via a LAN WAN or the Internet or otherwise can be read by a computer personal digital assistant PDA or other electronic device or any other suitable method for providing instructions on how to administer the composition drug to treat the patient.

Platelet rich plasma is labeled with 0.1 Ci C serotonin ml. Twenty l of HIT serum is incubated with 70 l of platelet suspension 300 000 platelets l in the presence of HIT antibody only HIT Antibody or HIT antibody in the presence of either increasing amounts of FI 1 5 mg ml or UFH 0.1 and 0.5 u ml . The reaction is stopped by EDTA and the amount of C serotonin released is determined. The results of this testing are shown in . As can be seen in complexes of FI and platelet proteins do not stimulate platelets to release serotonin in the presence of HIT sera.

Platelets are drawn from healthy human volunteers known not to have had exposure to drugs that interfere with platelet function. Whole blood 290 l is incubated with HIT serum 160 l in the presence of HIT antibody only HIT Antibody or HIT antibody either in the presence of increasing amounts of FI 0.01 10 mg ml or UFH 0.1 and 0.5 u ml . P Selectin expression is determined by flow cytometry using fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated anti CD61 antibody. The results of this testing are shown in . As can be seen in complexes of FI and platelet proteins do not induce platelet P selectin cell surface expression in the presence of HIT sera.

Whole blood 290 l is incubated with HIT serum 160 l in the presence of HIT antibody only HIT antibody or HIT antibody either in the presence of increasing amounts of FI 0.01 10 mg ml or UFH 0.1 and 0.5 u ml . Platelet microparticle release is determined by flow cytometry. The results of this testing are shown in . As can be seen in complexes of FI and platelet proteins do not stimulate platelets to produce procoagulant microparticles in the presence of HIT sera.

Platelet rich plasma is labeled with 0.1 Ci C serotnin ml. Twenty l of HIT serum source for HIT antibody is first incubated alone as the control HIT Antibody and with UFH at 0.1 U ml followed by the addition of increasing concentrations of DS OD or FI LMWDS followed by the addition of human platelets. The amount of C serotonin released in the assay is determined as described in Test 1 above. The results of this testing are shown in . As can be seen in increasing the sulfation OD and FI and decreasing the molecular weight FI improve the ability of dermatan sulfates to antagonize the activation of platelets by preformed immune complexes comprised of heparin platelet proteins and anti heparin antibody.

Whole blood 290 l is incubated with HIT serum 160 l the absence of HIT antibody alone and in the presence of UFH 0.1 u ml and in the presence of increasing amounts of FI 0.0001 1 mg ml . Platelet microparticle release is determined by flow cytometry similar to that described in Test 3 above. The results of this testing are shown in . As can be seen in the addition of FI blocks the ability of preformed immune complexes comprised of heparin platelet proteins and anti heparin antibody to induce the release of platelet microparticles.

Platelet rich plasma is labeled with 0.1 Ci C serotnin ml. Twenty l of HIT serum source for HIT antibody is first incubated in saline alone as the control Saline and also with UFH at either 0.1 U ml or at 0.5 U ml. Next increasing concentrations of selectively 2 O 3 O desulfated heparin Lot NH 001603 are added to each of the test series followed by the addition of human platelets. The amount of C serotonin released in the assay is determined as described in Test 1 above. The results of this testing are shown in . As can be seen in in the absence of added UFH the O desulfated heparin does not cross react with HIT immune sera and platelet proteins in a manner that leads to platelet activation at O desulfated heparin concentrations up to 100 g ml. Further O desulfated heparin causes a dose dependent inhibition of the heparin induced serotonin release from platelets exposed to HIT immune sera and thus antagonizes the activation of platelets by preformed immune complexes comprised of heparin platelet proteins and anti heparin antibody.

Test 7 Inhibiting Immunoreactivity of HIT Antibodies with Polyvinyl Sulfonate PF4 Antigenic Complexes as Detected by ELISA Assay

Preformed antigenic complexes comprised of polyvinylsulfonate PVS and PF4 bound to microtiter wells are incubated with increasing concentrations of FD FI FO OD or NH test samples are washed to remove the residual sample and are then incubated with human HIT immune serum or nonimmune serum as control . The amount of immune complex formation is then detected with alkaline phosphatase conjugated to goat anti human IgG affinity purified antibody by reaction with p nitrophenyl phosphate as the enzyme substrate and then determined spectrophotometrically at 405 nm. Values are corrected for nonimmune serum controls. The results graphically plotted in show FI FO OD and NH disrupt neoepitope expression of PVS PF4 complexes and their subsequent immunoreactivity with HIT antibodies better than FD.
