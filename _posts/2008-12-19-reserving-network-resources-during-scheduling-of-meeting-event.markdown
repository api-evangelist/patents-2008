The present disclosure generally relates to network based meeting scheduling and allocation of network resources for a meeting conducted via a data network such as the Internet.

Computer based calendars are used by individuals and organizations to schedule meetings and reserve meeting rooms. Such meetings often rely on network based communications for example video conference voice conference etc. A conference system typically relies on provisioning of network resources at the time of deployment that are dedicated exclusively to the conference system. The Cisco Unified Meetingplace system is a telephone conference system that requires provisioning of network resources at the time of deployment that are dedicated exclusively to the Cisco Unified Meetingplace system. The Cisco TelePresence system is network based video conference system that also requires provisioning of network resources at the time of deployment that are dedicated exclusively to the Cisco TelePresence system.

The Cisco TelePresence system reserves bandwidth and quality of service from the dedicated network resources at the time a TelePresence conference is initiated. The Cisco WebEx Web Conferencing System also reserves bandwidth at the time a web based conference is initiated. The Cisco Unified Meetingplace system the Cisco TelePresence system and the Cisco WebEx Web Conferencing System each are commercially available from Cisco Systems San Jose Calif.

In one embodiment a method comprises receiving a request for scheduling a meeting event between client endpoint devices in an Internet Protocol IP based network the meeting event having a starting time and duration the meeting event requiring identifiable network resources from the network determining whether the network will have available network capacity to supply the identifiable network resources during the meeting event and selectively reserving the identifiable network resources for the meeting event from the available network capacity based on determining the network will have the available network capacity during the meeting event.

In another embodiment an apparatus comprises a device interface circuit and a processor circuit. The device interface circuit is configured for receiving in an Internet Protocol IP based network a request for scheduling a meeting event between client endpoint devices in the network. The meeting event has a starting time and duration and requires identifiable network resources from the network. The processor circuit is configured for determining whether the network will have available network capacity to supply the identifiable network resources during the meeting event. The processor circuit further is configured for selectively reserving the identifiable network resources for the meeting event from the available network capacity based on determining the network will have the available network capacity during the meeting event.

Particular embodiments enable identifiable network resources in a network to be dynamically reserved for a meeting event scheduled between client endpoint devices at the time that the meeting event is scheduled. The identifiable network resources are dynamically reserved by a meeting server device i.e. a network resource reservation device in response to the meeting server device receiving a request for scheduling the meeting event and based on the meeting server device determining the network will have available network capacity to supply the identifiable network resources during the meeting event. If the meeting server device determines the network will not have the available network capacity during the meeting event the meeting server device can send a request for additional network capacity required for the meeting. The meeting server device can reserve the identifiable network resources in response to receiving a reply indicating the additional network capacity will be available for the meeting. Alternately if the meeting server device determines the additional network capacity required for the meeting event will not be available the meeting server device can recommend an alternative start time for the meeting event.

The meeting server device also can implement the meeting for the starting time based on deploying the identifiable network resources reserved for the event for example based on sending commands to router devices or firewall devices in the network for initiation of the meeting event according to the reserved network resources and according to network policies established for the meeting event. The meeting server also can release the identifiable network resources back to the available network capacity and or return the additional network capacity e.g. having been leased from an Internet Service Provider in response to confirming the meeting event has ended.

Hence network resources in a network can be scheduled and reserved according to calendar based meeting event planning based on comparing whether provisioned network capacity in the network will have available network capacity to supply the identifiable network resources required during the meeting event. Further meeting event planning can include requesting additional network capacity on at least a temporary basis where the identifiable network resources and additional network capacity can be released for reuse or reclamation in response to confirming the meeting event has ended.

The example network can include a second autonomous system AS and at least one Internet Service Provider ISP that provides a wide area network WAN reachability for the autonomous system AS to reach the second autonomous system AS and other client endpoint devices e.g. C . The Internet Service Provider can be implemented as an incumbent local exchange carrier ILEC a competing local exchange carrier CLEC a cable television operator providing Internet access etc. Hence the network provides reachability between the client endpoint devices e.g. C C C C C C and or C .

The Internet Service Provider can be implemented as an Internet Access provider or a Network Service Provider i.e. a Tier 1 network . The ISP provides network access for the autonomous system AS to a wide area network e.g. the Internet by provisioning one or more network access links L to the autonomous system AS . The network access link L can be implemented as a fractional T1 data link i.e. less than 1.544 Mb s one or more T1 data links each T1 data link providing a 1.544 Mb s data connection a T3 data link i.e. 43.232 Mb s equivalent to 28 T1 data links or any combination thereof based on a contractual arrangement between the ISP and the autonomous system AS . As described below the network access link L can be provisioned based on connecting multiple physical data links e.g. T1 to the border router where only a portion of the connected physical data links are activated by the ISP .

An Autonomous System e.g. AS refers to a collection of Internet Protocol router devices e.g. R R R R R under a single technical administration using an interior gateway protocol IGP and common metrics to determine how to route packets within the Autonomous System e.g. AS and using an inter Autonomous System routing protocol e.g. Border Gateway Protocol BGP to determine how to route packets to other Autonomous Systems see e.g. the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF Request for Comments RFC at Sec. 1.1 . In this example the router devices R R R R R within the autonomous system AS could exchange routing information according to an interior gateway protocol such as a distance vector routing protocol or a link state routing protocol in contrast the border routers R and R could exchange routing information with routers in the ISP according to BGP as described in the IETF RFC 4271.

As illustrated in the autonomous systems AS and AS and the ISP each include a Network Management System also referred to as a Network Operations Center NOC . Each network management system is configured for maintaining a corresponding network inventory of all network equipment that is deployed within the corresponding network or including deployed router devices switching devices not shown active network links server devices or etc. Hence at least a portion of the network inventory is deployed and assigned by the network management system as provisioned network capacity within the corresponding network or . Hence the provisioned network capacity is the maximum capacity that is available for use within the corresponding network e.g. AS according to its existing configuration i.e. its existing deployment . As described below with respect to the provisioned network capacity can change over time as additional network equipment is added to the network inventory and or as additional network equipment already in the network inventory is provisioned and deployed in the corresponding autonomous system .

The meeting server device is an apparatus i.e. a machine deployed within the autonomous system AS . The meeting server comprises a device interface circuit a processor circuit and a memory circuit .

Any of the disclosed circuits of the meeting server device including the device interface circuit the processor circuit and the memory circuit and their associated components can be implemented in multiple forms. Example implementations of the disclosed circuits include hardware logic that is implemented in a logic array such as a programmable logic array PLA a field programmable gate array FPGA or by mask programming of integrated circuits such as an application specific integrated circuit ASIC . Any of these circuits also can be implemented using a software based executable resource that is executed by a corresponding internal processor circuit such as a microprocessor circuit not shown where execution of executable code stored in an internal memory circuit e.g. within the memory circuit causes the processor circuit to store application state variables in processor memory creating an executable application resource e.g. an application instance that performs the operations of the circuit as described herein. Hence use of the term circuit in this specification refers to both a hardware based circuit that includes logic for performing the described operations or a software based circuit that includes a reserved portion of processor memory for storage of application state data and application variables that are modified by execution of the executable code by a processor circuit. The memory circuit can be implemented for example using a non volatile memory such as a programmable read only memory PROM or an EPROM and or a volatile memory such as a DRAM etc.

Further any reference to outputting a message or outputting a packet or the like can be implemented based on creating the message packet in the form of a data structure and storing that data structure in a tangible memory medium in the disclosed apparatus e.g. in a transmit buffer . Any reference to outputting a message or outputting a packet or the like also can include electrically transmitting e.g. via wired electric current or wireless electric field as appropriate the message packet stored in the tangible memory medium to another network node via a communications medium e.g. a wired or wireless link as appropriate optical transmission also can be used as appropriate . Similarly any reference to receiving a message or receiving a packet or the like can be implemented based on the disclosed apparatus detecting the electrical or optical transmission of the message packet on the communications medium and storing the detected transmission as a data structure in a tangible memory medium in the disclosed apparatus e.g. in a receive buffer . Also note that the memory circuit can be implemented dynamically by the processor circuit for example based on memory address assignment and partitioning executed by the processor circuit .

The meeting server device is configured for responding to a request for scheduling a meeting event between client endpoint devices based on determining whether the network or at least a portion thereof will have available network capacity to supply the identifiable network resources during the meeting event. illustrates the meeting server device reserving identifiable network resources relative to available network capacity within the provisioned network capacity . The processor circuit can reserve the identifiable network resources required for a meeting event M based on determining the network or at least a portion of the autonomous system AS has the available network capacity to supply the identifiable network resources relative to the provisioned network capacity and any other allocated network capacity . As illustrated in the only allocated network capacity at event coinciding with the start time of the meeting event M is low priority unreserved network resources e.g. low priority e mail or web browsing traffic . As described below with respect to the processor circuit also can request additional network capacity be added to the provisioned network capacity in response to receiving a request for scheduling a meeting event the request for additional network capacity can be generated by the processor circuit in response to the processor circuit determining the network or requires the additional network capacity to accommodate a meeting event for example the concurrent implementing of the meeting events M and M .

Hence identifiable network resources can be selectively reserved for a meeting event at the time that the meeting event is scheduled ensuring guaranteed deployment of bandwidth and quality of service requirements for the meeting event.

The device interface circuit of the meeting server is configured for receiving via the data link L in step a request for scheduling a meeting event e.g. M between client endpoint devices e.g. C C and C within the network .

The request for scheduling a meeting event i.e. scheduling request can be generated by one of the client endpoint devices regardless of whether the client endpoint device generating the request is to participate in the meeting event . The scheduling request also can be generated by a processor based server device in the autonomous system AS not shown that executes a calender server program on behalf of the client endpoint devices for example the commercially available Microsoft Exchange Server IBM Lotus Notes etc.

The scheduling request also can be used to reserve network resources for maintenance. For example the scheduling request also can be generated by the NOC for example if service personnel wish to perform network maintenance e.g. reconfiguration upgrades repairs testing etc. on an identified portion of the autonomous system AS e.g. one or more routers one or more links one or more servers etc. . In this example the scheduling request generated by the NOC could explicitly specify one or more network components e.g. router R link L VPN concentrator a specific firewall device etc. .

The scheduling request can specify the start time and duration and start date if on a different date and the client endpoint devices that are to participate in the meeting event . If needed the scheduling request also can specify meeting type e.g. video audio etc. whether any data files need to be distributed to meeting participants etc. alternately attributes describing the meeting can be obtained based on the scheduling request providing a reference to another data structure stored in the autonomous system AS that describes the identifiable network resources that are required for the event.

The processor circuit of the meeting server device is configured for responding to the scheduling request received in step by determining in step whether the network e.g. AS or will have available network capacity to supply the network resources required for the meeting event from the autonomous system AS the ISP and or the autonomous system AS . For example assume the scheduling request is for the meeting event M and specifies a meeting time starting at event of at 8 00 AM on Dec. 18 2008 between the client endpoint devices C C and C deployed exclusively within the autonomous system AS . The processor circuit can parse the scheduling request and identify in step that the requested meeting event M will require Voice over IP connections and limited file transfer capabilities between the client endpoint devices C C and C implemented for example using 0.5 Mb s bandwidth links providing a guaranteed voice quality grade quality of service between the client endpoint devices C C and C . Hence the processor circuit can determine that the meeting event M requires 0.5 Mb s guaranteed bandwidth and a voice quality grade quality of service for the data links L L L and L provided by the router devices R and R .

The processor circuit determines in step whether the network e.g. AS will have available network capacity to supply the identifiable network resources identified in step during the meeting event e.g. M . For example the processor circuit of the meeting server device can access in step a data structure containing network resource records relevant to the duration of the meeting event i.e. between events and of . In particular the processor circuit can access the provisioned network capacity illustrated as stored within the tangible data structure stored in the memory circuit . Alternately the tangible data structure can be stored on another tangible storage device e.g. a network enabled hard disk drive reachable by the device interface circuit . The processor circuit also can access stored data structures within the data structure referred to as network meeting overlay files.

Each network meeting overlay file defines a previously scheduled meeting event overlying the network based on assignment of identifiable network resources for the corresponding meeting event hence each network meeting overlay file defines the identifiable network resources that already have been reserved for the corresponding meeting event .

The processor circuit compares in step the starting time and duration of the meeting event e.g. M specified in the meeting request with the provisioned network capacity and any other meeting events scheduled for deployment concurrently with the requested meeting event. Assume for example that the scheduling request for the meeting event M is the first request received by the meeting server device and that the only other allocated network capacity is the unreserved low priority network resources illustrated in . If the processor circuit determines in step that the network will have available network capacity at the scheduled meeting time to supply the network resources required for the meeting event the processor circuit can generate in step a new network meeting overlay file that defines the new meeting event overlying the network e.g. AS and reserve the identifiable network resources for the meeting event based on specifying the identifiable network resources in the new network meeting overlay file . Hence using the example of the meeting event M requiring 0.5 Mb s of network resources the processor circuit determines in step that the relevant allocated network capacity for the unreserved network resources at event is 0.05 Mb s that the provisioned network capacity at event is 3.75 Mb s hence the available network capacity at event after accounting for the meeting event M will be 3.20 Mb s i.e. 3.75 Mb s minus 0.5 Mb s minus 0.05 Mb s . Hence the processor circuit determines in step that the available network capacity of 3.70 Mb s at event will be sufficient to supply the required 0.5 Mb s of network resources for the meeting event M .

Hence the processor circuit reserves the identifiable network resources for the meeting event M based on creating in step the network meeting overlay file illustrated in .

The network policies specified in the network meeting overlay file can include a meeting reservation priority client specific meeting requirements e.g. and plus network device specific meeting requirements .

The meeting reservation priority can identify a relative priority of the meeting enabling higher priority meetings e.g. having a priority value of 5 to preempt lower priority meetings e.g. having a priority of 4 or lower .

The client specific meeting requirements e.g. can specify a file transfer authorization specifying whether the corresponding client endpoint device e.g. C is authorized to transfer data files for example according to FTP protocol. The file transfer authorization can specify a maximum file size e.g. 500 Megabytes Mb permissible file types identifiable for example based on MIME encoding file extension naming such as .pdf .ppt .txt .wav .mov etc.

The network policies also can specify a bandwidth capacity for the corresponding client endpoint device e.g. C a guaranteed quality of service QoS requirement for the corresponding client endpoint device e.g. voice quality grade quality of service required and or network traffic prioritization . The QoS requirement can refer to implementing prescribed network parameters to minimize quality adverse effects such as jitter delay dropped packets latency etc. in order to maintain prescribed quality constraints.

The network traffic prioritization can identify the respective priorities the respective network traffic types during the meeting event . As illustrated with respect to the network meeting overlay file voice traffic has the highest priority 5 followed by files transferred according to the FTP protocol 3 or 2 with instant messaging traffic being assigned the lowest relative priority 2 or 1 .

The network meeting overlay file also specifies network device specific meeting requirements enabling the processor circuit to implement the meeting event M for the specified starting time on the specified meeting date . The processor circuit implements the meeting event M based on sending explicit commands to the network devices e.g. the router devices R and R in order to guarantee the reserved network resources for the meeting events M described in further detail below with respect to .

Referring to assume that following the creation of the network meeting overlay file for the meeting event M and storage in the data structure in step the device interface circuit of the meeting server device receives in step another scheduling request from a client endpoint device for scheduling a meeting event M having the starting time and duration of 9 00 AM to 2 00 PM on Dec. 18 2008 illustrated as starting event and ending event in . The scheduling request for the meeting event M also can specify the meeting event M is between the client endpoint devices C C and C . As illustrated in the client endpoint devices C and C are reachable via the wide area network requiring creation of encrypted VPN connections by the VPN concentrator device to ensure meeting security in compliance with corporate or regulatory policies.

The processor circuit identifies the network resources required from the network for the meeting event or at least required from the autonomous system AS in step e.g. 2.75 Mb s required for meeting event M and accesses in step the provisioned network capacity data structure and the network meeting overlay file for the meeting event M . In particular the processor circuit retrieves the network meeting overlay file based on detecting the meeting events M and M having concurrent requirements of network capacity between events and . As described above the allocated network capacity as of event is 0.55 Mb s where 0.5 Mb s is reserved for the resources of the meeting event M and 0.05 Mb s is allocated for the unassigned network resources . Further the provisioned network capacity e.g. for data link L from event to event is 3.75 Mb s e.g. data link L is deployed using 2 T1 lines and one fractional T1 line 0.75 Mb s leased by the NOC of the autonomous system AS from the ISP .

As illustrated in the processor circuit determines in step that the available network capacity during the meeting event M starting at event e.g. 3.2 Mb s is sufficient to supply the identified network resources that are required for the meeting event M e.g. 2.75 Mb s . Hence the processor circuit of the meeting server device reserves in step the identifiable network resources based on creating a network meeting overlay file illustrated in that defines the meeting event M overlying the network . Specifically the network meeting overlay file assigns the identifiable network resources to the meeting event M to guarantee that the network resources are reserved for the meeting event M . As illustrated in the concurrent reservation of the network resources and for the respective meeting events M and M results in an allocated network capacity of 3.3 Mb s which is below the provisioned network capacity between events and of 3.75 Mb s.

As illustrated in the network meeting overlay file created by the processor circuit in step defines the meeting event M based on reservation and assignment of the identifiable network resources to the meeting event M . The network policies specify bandwidth and quality of service requirements in order to guarantee high quality video teleconferencing e.g. 1080p format high definition television using for example Cisco TelePresence equipment deployed at the client endpoint devices C and C . In contrast the bandwidth and quality of service requirements for the client endpoint device C specify a voice grade e.g. Voice over IP quality. Further the network policies and the network device specific meeting requirements identify the VPN connections VPN and VPN to be established by the VPN concentrator device as well as the relevant bandwidth and quality of service requirements for the respective VPN connections .

Hence the storage of the network meeting overlay file by the processor circuit into the data structure enables the processor circuit to later implement the meeting M based on retrieving the corresponding network meeting overlay file and deploying the identifiable network resources based on sending the appropriate commands to the network devices and .

Following storage of the network meeting overlay files and in the data structure for the respective meeting events M and M assume with respect to that the device interface circuit receives in step a scheduling request from a requesting client endpoint device for a meeting event M between the client endpoint devices C C and C having a start time and duration of 1 00 PM to 2 30 PM on Dec. 18 2008 illustrated in by the start event and the end event . Following identification of the network resources required from the network for the meeting event M in step e.g. 2.25 Mb s required at least from link L the processor circuit retrieves in step the provisioned network capacity e.g. 3.75 Mb s for at least the data link L and the network meeting overlay file based on detecting the meeting events M and M having concurrent requirements of network capacity between events and .

The processor circuit determines in steps and that the available network capacity at least for the data link L prior to the starting event for the meeting event M is the difference between the allocated network capacity of 2.8 Mb s and the provisioned network capacity of 3.75 Mb s resulting in an available network capacity at least on the data link L of 0.95 Mb s. Hence the processor circuit determines in step that the network e.g. the data link L will not have the available network capacity of 2.55 Mb s required during the meeting event M .

In response to determining in step that the available network capacity e.g. 0.95 Mb s will not be sufficient to supply the identifiable network resources e.g. 2.25 Mb s for the meeting event M the processor circuit is configured for sending in step a request for additional network capacity that is required for the meeting event M . The processor circuit sends in step the request for additional network capacity e.g. an additional T1 connection for the data link L to the network management system NOC of the autonomous system AS .

In one embodiment the request for additional network capacity can be implemented in the form of an automated e mail message that is sent to a prescribed destination within the NOC where network provisioning equipment within the NOC and under the control of network management personnel can negotiate with the NOC of the ISP for leasing the additional network capacity for at least the overlapping time interval between the events and of .

In another embodiment the request for additional network capacity can be implemented using network based application programming interfaces APIs executed by the processor circuit and the NOCs in the autonomous system AS and the ISP . In this example the network provisioning equipment in the NOC of the autonomous system AS can be configured for automatically responding to the request for additional network capacity based on automatically sending the request to the NOC of the ISP . The NOC of the ISP can be configured for automatically activating a connected T1 link between the border router R and an access router not shown of the ISP enabling the provisioned network capacity to be dynamically increased by the additional network capacity as required between the events and .

The request for additional network capacity also can be sent by the processor circuit to the NOC of the autonomous system AS for example based on retrieving stored data structures identifying insufficient network capacity within the autonomous system AS . The NOC of the autonomous system AS can be configured to grant access to the meeting server device of the autonomous system AS for example based on a trusted relationship between the autonomous systems AS and AS .

If in step the processor circuit of the meeting server device receives via the device interface circuit a reply from the NOC of the autonomous system AS and or the ISP indicating that the additional network capacity will not be available the processor circuit can generate in step a meeting response to the requesting client endpoint device recommending an alternate start time for the meeting event for example based on identifying from the data structure a time where there is available network capacity to supply the required network resources Hence a user can be notified at the time the scheduling request is generated if the required network resources are not available.

Assuming in step that the processor circuit receives a reply from the NOC of the autonomous system AS and or the ISP indicating that the additional network capacity will be available between the events and the processor circuit can reserve in step the identified network resources for the meeting event M based on creating the network meeting overlay file illustrated in .

As illustrated in the network meeting overlay file created by the processor circuit in step defines the meeting event M based on reservation and assignment of the identifiable network resources to the meeting event M . The network policies specify bandwidth and quality of service requirements in order to guarantee high quality video teleconferencing e.g. 1080p format high definition television using for example Cisco TelePresence equipment deployed at the client endpoint devices C and C . The bandwidth and quality of service requirements for the client endpoint device C specify a voice grade e.g. Voice over IP quality. Further the network policies and the network device specific meeting requirements identify the VPN connection VPN to be established by the VPN concentrator device as well as the relevant bandwidth and quality of service requirements for the VPN connections VPN .

Hence the storage of the network meeting overlay file by the processor circuit into the data structure enables the processor circuit to later implement the meeting M based on retrieving the corresponding network meeting overlay file and deploying the identifiable network resources based on sending the appropriate commands to the network devices and .

Hence the creation and storage of the network meeting overlay files and by the processor circuit guarantees that the required network resources and are reserved from the available network capacity relative to the provisioned network capacity . In addition the example embodiment demonstrates that the meeting server device can request the additional network capacity if needed in order to increase the available network capacity to a level that is sufficient to supply the identifiable network resources required for a meeting event. Consequently network capacity can be dynamically adjusted based on calendar based scheduling of meetings that require network resources.

The processor circuit of the meeting server device parses the network meeting overlay file e.g. and implements the meeting for the starting time beginning at event based on deploying the identifiable network resources in step . In particular the processor circuit can send configuration commands for the meeting event e.g. M in step to the relevant network elements. Example configuration commands include bandwidth reservation commands and quality of service policy commands that are sent to the relevant router devices e.g. R and R quality of service policy commands and filtering policy commands sent to firewall devices e.g. implemented within the router devices R and R .

In the case of implementing the meetings M or M based on retrieval of the respective network meeting overlay files and the processor circuit also can send commands to the VPN concentrator device prior to the corresponding starting time enabling the VPN concentrator device to initiate a secure tunnel connection e.g. a VPN connection with a client endpoint device e.g. VPN for client endpoint device C or a peer VPN concentrator device e.g. VPN and VPN with VPN concentrator in the autonomous system AS via the peer border routers R and R . If a client endpoint device e.g. C outside the autonomous system AS does not have a VPN resources necessary for VPN creation the processor circuit can add to the network meeting overlay file e.g. an instruction for the VPN concentrator to send a single use or limited time use e.g. can use up to five times VPN key to the client endpoint device C and to perform a pre meeting test of the VPN connection VPN . Hence the processor circuit in response to parsing the network meeting overlay file can send a command to the VPN concentrator to ensure all client endpoint devices invited to the meeting M are properly configured for establishing the required VPN connection .

In addition security policies and or quality of service policies can be sent by the processor circuit in step to the appropriate firewall devices in order to enforce corporate or regulatory policy requirements during the relevant meeting .

The processor circuit begins execution of the meeting in step by permitting incoming connections from client endpoint devices that are invited to the meeting at a prescribed time interval before the start of the meeting e.g. 10 minutes prior to the start of a meeting . The incoming connections can be either TCP IP connections for a web based meeting incoming Voice over IP connections for a voice conference call and or incoming video connections for a video conferencing system. If in step there are any client endpoint devices that have not yet established a connection with the meeting server device the processor circuit of the meeting server device can initiate in step the relevant connections e.g. web based Voice over IP based or video based with the remaining client endpoint devices invited to the meeting e.g. 1 minute prior to the start of the meeting and bridge the connections either before or coincident with the scheduled beginning of the meeting at the prescribed start event e.g. for the meeting event M .

The messaging server device also can manage the identified network resources that are assigned for the relevant meeting as the meeting progresses. For example if in step the processor circuit detects that the meeting ends early where all the client endpoint devices have disconnected from the meeting event the processor circuit can terminate the meeting by releasing in step the identified network resources from the meeting event back to the available network capacity . The processor circuit also can output messages in step to the network devices e.g. the router devices the firewall devices the VPN concentrator device etc. to cancel the configuration commands sent in step for deployment of the meeting alternately the configuration commands sent in step each can include a timer field that specifies a lifetime for the configuration command.

If in step the processor circuit detects that the prescribed meeting time has expired the processor circuit can send a query to one or more of the client endpoint devices invited to the meeting to determine if extra time is requested to continue the meeting. If extra time is requested the processor circuit can add additional time to the meeting in step for up to a prescribed maximum e.g. 30 minutes . In response to the processor circuit confirming in step that the meeting has ended e.g. based on detecting all client endpoint devices have disconnected from the meeting event or based on receiving a terminate instruction from one of the client endpoint devices the processor circuit can release the network resources from the meeting event back to the available network capacity for reuse. The release of the network resources can be implemented based on either deleting the relevant network meeting overlay file or moving the network meeting overlay file from the data structure used to calculate available network capacity to another storage location for archived storage.

According to example embodiments network resources can be dynamically allocated and reserved for future calendar based meetings where the availability of network resources required for a meeting event is compared at the time of scheduling the meeting with available network capacity that will be available at the time of the meeting event. Hence the behavior of the network can be associated with calendar based events where the behavior of the network is based on network resource allocation relative to available network capacity and changing provisioned network capacity as needed to accommodate requirements for network resources.

Although the example embodiments illustrate that the single meeting server device executes both the resource reservation illustrated in and the meeting deployment in a distributed architecture can be implemented where one or more meeting server devices reserve identifiable network resources for meeting events according to and another set of one or more meeting server devices implement the meetings according to .

While the example embodiments in the present disclosure have been described in connection with what is presently considered to be the best mode for carrying out the subject matter specified in the appended claims it is to be understood that the example embodiments are only illustrative and are not to restrict the subject matter specified in the appended claims.
