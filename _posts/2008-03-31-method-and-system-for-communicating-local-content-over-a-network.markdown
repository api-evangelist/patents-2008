The communications system may further include a reporting module on the partner computer system that reports the transaction by automatically transmitting a transaction report from the partner computer system to the local content provider system.

The customer computer systems are connected over the Internet A to the local content provider computer system . The local content provider computer system holds databases with account data and data of business of customers. A customer at each one of the customer computer systems can access the local content provider computer system . The customer can enroll by creating an account on the local content provider computer system and store associated content such as business content on the local content provider computer system .

The partner computer systems are connected over the Internet B to the local content provider computer system . Local content and account information can be transmitted from the local computer provider computer system over the Internet B to the partner computer system as needed.

Some of the remote computer systems are connected over the Internet C to one of the partner computer systems while some of the remote computer systems are connected over the Internet D to another one of the partner computer systems and some of the remote computer systems are connected over the Internet E to a further one of the partner computer systems . The local content received by one of the partner computer systems can be transmitted over for example the Internet E to one of the remote computer systems as required. Any transactions between one of the partner computer systems and a remote computer system can be reported to the local content provider computer system by transmitting a transaction report from the partner computer system over the Internet B to the local content provider computer system .

As shown in the local content provider computer system includes a payment module an account data store in the form of an account database a plurality of account entries one of which is shown stored in the account database a content module a content data store in the form of a content database a plurality of added local content entries one of which is shown stored in the content database and a geographic location module . A customer computer system connects through the payment module to the account database . The content module is connected to and receives input from the customer computer system and the geographic location module . The content module is connected to the content database .

Each account entry includes at least a customer and an account total. The customer may be identified by name customer number etc. Each one of the added local content entries includes a name typically a business name an address a geographic location and added content. Each one of the added local content entries is associated with one of the account entries .

The functioning of is now described with reference to . A customer at the customer computer system operates the customer computer system to transmit a signal to the local content provider system wherein the signal includes a request for an enrollment page. The local content provider computer system then automatically transmits a signal to the customer computer system that includes the enrollment page. The customer at the customer computer system can then complete the enrollment page with enrollment information and then cause the transmission of a signal from the customer computer system to the local content provider computer system the signal including the enrollment information. At Block the enrollment information is received by the local content provider computer system .

For purposes of further discussion the contents of each signal the transmission of the signal and the reception of the signal is not described in detail. The contents of each signal should however be evident to one of ordinary skill in the art and one of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate that each signal is transmitted sometimes automatically from one computer system to another computer system as hereinbefore described with respect to enrollment.

At Block the local content provider computer system receives the content of an added local content entry . The contents of the added local content entry are received when the customer at the customer computer system accesses the content module and uploads the contents of the added local content entry utilizing the content module . The contents of the added local content entry that are uploaded by the customer at the customer computer system include the name typically a business name address and added content of the added local content entry .

At Block a geographic location is generated for the added local content entry . The content module communicates the address of the added local content entry to the geographic location module and the geographic location module provides the geographic location corresponding to the address to the content module . The geographic location typically includes longitude and latitude. The geographic location is then associated and forms part of the added local content entry . At Block the added local content entry is stored in the content database of the local content provider computer system .

At Block the local content provider computer system receives an update of an account balance upon payment. The customer at the customer computer system accesses the payment module and utilizes the payment module to submit a payment. Upon completion of the payment the account total of the account entry corresponding to the customer is increased by an amount that equals the payment. The final account balance is thus equal to the amount reflected in the account entry before completion of the payment plus the amount of the payment. At Block the account total of the account entry is updated and stored in the account database .

The business targeting module is connected to the content database . The data forwarding and updating module is connected to the business targeting module . The account reduction module is connected to the account database .

The partner database is connected to a feed preparation module A of the data forwarding and updating module . The partner Web application system is connected to the partner database . The data collection module connects the partner Web application system to the account reduction module . The partner Web application system is connected to the remote computer system to receive signals from the remote computer system .

The content database includes a plurality of added local content entries as hereinbefore described and also includes a plurality of primary local content entries . Each one of the added local content entries can be matched with a respective one of the primary local content entries by comparing the name address geographic location telephone number and or other unique identifier of the added and primary local content entries and . There are usually more primary local content entries than added local content entries which means that only a subset of the primary local content entries can be matched to the added local content entries . The added local content entries include the added content that was entered and described with reference to and the primary local content entries do not include the added content. The added local content entries also include a flag indication whether money is available in the corresponding account entry .

A user at the remote computer system can download a search page from the partner Web application system and enter a local search request on the search page. At Block the user transmits the local search request from the remote computer system to the partner Web application system and the partner Web application system receives the local search request.

At Block the partner Web application system extracts a subset of the matched entries from the partner database . The matched entries that are extracted from the partner database are geographically close to a location indicated by the local search request e.g. within a radius of five miles. All matched entries based on the search query are extracted but only matched entries corresponding to added local content entries flagged with Y that sufficient money is available indicate any added content originally from the added local content entries .

At Block the partner Web application system generates a results page and transmits the results page with entry selectors of the extracted entries to the remote computer system . The user at the remote computer system can then select one of the entry selectors. At Block the selection made at the remote computer system is automatically transmitted from the remote computer system to the partner Web application system upon selection of one of the entry selections. At Block the partner Web application system automatically transmits the entry corresponding to the entry selection originally made at the remote computer system to the remote computer system .

At Block the data collection module simultaneously and automatically transmits a transaction report from the partner computer system to the local content provider computer system . In another embodiment transaction reports can be collected by the data collection module and be transmitted in a delayed feed for example hourly or weekly. The transaction report includes an indication of the specific local content entry that has been selected at the remote computer system and transmitted from the partner Web application system to the remote computer system . The account reduction module receives the transaction report and automatically updates the account total by reducing the account total of the account entry corresponding to the added local content entry selected at the remote computer system by a predetermined amount.

It can thus be seen that an account entry on the local content provider computer system is charged due to a transaction that happens between the partner computer system and the remote computer system . The account total can again be updated by replenishing the account total as hereinbefore described with reference to .
