The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

the present disclosure generally relates to mirrors and more particularly relates to mirrors that reflect incident light based upon the intensity of the incident light.

Typically a mirror comprises a sheet of glass that is coated on its backside with a metal e.g. silver or aluminum. When light is incident upon the mirror the metal coating reflects the light thereby producing images by reflection to one who is looking into the mirror.

Such mirrors are typically manufactured by sputtering a thin layer of aluminum or silver onto the back of the glass when the glass is in a vacuum. Alternatively some mirrors are made by evaporating the aluminum or silver onto the front of the glass.

In the past some mirrors were made with a tin amalgam. In this regard a piece of glass was placed over tin foil covered with liquid mercury. The tin and the mercury created a reflective coating made up of a part solid and part fluid phase of the tin amalgam.

It is an object of the present invention to provide a passive mirror capable of blocking the reflection of harmful optical transients of visible light to protect the eye of a viewer.

It is still another object of the present invention to provide a passive mirror that blocks the reflection of optical transients exceeding a fluence threshold by a destructive absorption process.

It is still another object of the invention to make a thin film reflective material having a low boiling point.

A representative embodiment of a mirror in accordance with the present disclosure comprises a first substrate and a reflective film. The reflective film is formed on the first substrate and comprises mercury and at least one metal wherein the mirror is operative such that light incident upon the first substrate and having a fluence that falls below a threshold is reflected by the reflective film and light incident upon the first substrate and having a fluence that exceeds the threshold passes through the reflective film.

A representative embodiment of a method in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure can be broadly summarized by the following steps coating a first substrate with an amalgam forming metal suspending the coated substrate in a growth vessel the growth vessel containing liquid mercury and sealing the growth vessel until a reflective amalgam film forms on the first substrate.

Other systems methods features and advantages of the present disclosure will be or may become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following drawings and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems methods features and advantages be included within this description be within the scope of the present disclosure and be protected by the accompanying claims.

The present disclosure generally relates to mirrors and methods for making mirrors. In this regard an embodiment of a mirror comprises an amalgam film on a transparent substrate. The mirror is operative such that when light exhibiting a fluence that exceeds a threshold is incident upon the mirror the amalgam reaches its boiling point. At its boiling point the amalgam disintegrates thereby allowing the light to propagate through the mirror. In contrast any light incident upon the mirror that exhibits a fluence that does not exceed the fluence threshold is reflected. Note that fluence is a measure of energy per unit area such as Joules centimeter.

Furthermore the present disclosure relates to methods for making such a mirror. In this regard a transparent substrate coated with an amalgam forming metal is suspended within a cavity of a container that is housing liquid mercury Hg . The container is sealed and mercury vapor emitted from the liquid mercury reacts with the amalgam forming metal thereby generating a reflective film on the transparent substrate. In one embodiment an inert gas atmosphere of nitrogen or argon in the cavity of the container should prevent oxidation of the mercury. Notably the metal selected for such reaction is preferably a low boiling point metal e.g. a metal having a boiling point relatively near the boiling point of liquid mercury. Thus when light having a fluence exceeding the particular threshold described herein is incident upon the mirror the mirror allows the light to be transmitted as opposed to reflecting the light.

Note that the growth vessel depicted in is cylindrically shaped. However containers having alternative shapes are possible in other embodiments. For example the growth vessel may be a square or rectangular.

The removable lid is coupled to a substrate holder . The substrate holder extends from the lid and into the container when the lid is coupled to the container . The substrate holder is further coupled to a substrate . The substrate is preferably transparent and may be for example a piece of glass.

A layer of amalgam forming metal hereinafter referred to as seed layer is deposited on the substrate prior to suspending the substrate in the cavity . The seed layer may comprise for example silver Ag gold Au or cadmium Cd . The seed layer is preferably a thin metal film exhibiting an exemplary approximate thickness of 30 400 nanometers nm . The seed layer may be formed on the substrate via a vacuum evaporation process a sputtering process or any other known or future developed process for depositing the seed layer on the substrate .

Further note that the term amalgam refers to an alloy of mercury and at least one other metal. For example the amalgam may contain mercury and gold mercury and silver or mercury and cadmium. As described further herein the metal selected for seed layer preferably has a boiling point that is substantially close to mercury.

In addition a drop of liquid mercury is placed within the container body . As is depicted in the drop of liquid mercury may be deposited on a floor of the container body . In this regard because mercury has a significant partial pressure at 25 C. metal may react with mercury vapor produced by the liquid mercury deposited on the floor of the container . Note that at 25 C. the vapor pressure of mercury is 1.7 10torr and at 100 C. it is 0.25 torr. Torr refers to the atmospheric pressure that supports a column of mercury one millimeter high. As the temperature increases the growth rate of the amalgam film increases and the resulting mirror may exhibit poor quality.

Note that mercury is liquid at room temperature. Furthermore mercury evaporates at room temperature emitting colorless odorless mercury vapors. Thus when the cavity is sealed the growth vessel contains mercury vapors emitted from the liquid mercury . When the mercury vapors are contained within the cavity by the lid the mercury vapors react with the amalgam forming metal seed layer thereby forming a reflective amalgam film layer . The amount of the mercury in the reflective amalgram film can vary between zero and 50 atomic percent thereof.

Liquid mercury Hg reacting with the metal M seed layer to form an amalgam film may be represented by the following equation 

The reflective amalgam film layer exists in mercury vapor phase equilibrium thereby rendering the film stable. In this regard after a period of time e.g. a 24 hour period the film is formed within the container and equilibrium is reached. When such equilibrium is reached the amalgam film layer and the substrate reflect incident light that is below a fluence threshold and transmits light that exceeds the fluence threshold.

In this regard the metal selected for the seed layer preferably exhibits a mid range to low boiling point. For example the metal selected for the seed layer may be gold Au having a boiling point of 2807 C. silver Ag having a boiling point of 2212 C. or cadmium Cd having a boiling point of 765 C. In this regard mercury exhibits a boiling point of 356.58 C. Thus when light incident to the reflective amalgam film exceeds the fluence threshold e.g. 0.5 J cm microJoules centimeter the light does not reflect off the film . In the case of cadmium as the seed layer the cadmium film itself may act as a threshold mirror when no mercury is present i.e. the atomic fraction of mercury present is zero.

Instead the incident light strikes a portion of the amalgam film the mercury within that portion of the amalgam film reaches its boiling point and the mercury portion of the film mercury evaporates thereby allowing the light to pass through the film . Therefore light having a fluence that exceeds the threshold value damages the amalgam film and light incident upon that portion that has been damaged previously is no longer reflected. This aspect is described hereinafter with reference to .

The mirror further comprises a second transparent substrate . In this regard the substrate is coupled to the second transparent substrate via a sealant . Such sealant may comprise for example an epoxy or silicone resin for sealing an air or inert gas gap formed when the substrates and are coupled one to the other.

Note that the second transparent substrate may be for example a piece of glass. Further note that in one embodiment the substrates and are coated with an anti reflection coating such that undesired light does not reflect off the transparent substrates and . Instead light is reflected off the amalgam film .

In this regard when the light exhibits an intensity that falls below a fluence threshold e.g. 0.5 J cm the intensity of the light is not sufficient to change the phase of the mercury or the metal in the amalgam film . Thus the film reflects the light as indicated.

Further if the intensity of the light exceeds the above referenced fluence threshold e.g. 0.5 J cm the light exhibits intensity sufficient to change the phase of the mercury and or metal in the amalgam film . When such change occurs the mercury and or the metal in the amalgam film reaches their boiling points and a portion of the film is damaged i.e. the mercury boils away and no longer reflects. When that portion is damaged that portion of the film no longer reflects the light as described with reference to . Instead the light passes through the anti reflection coatings the substrate the damaged portion the air gap and the second substrate . Thus at least a portion of the light incident upon the mirror is not reflected.

The user inserts the transparent substrate that is coated with the amalgam forming metal layer in a growth vessel containing liquid mercury as indicated in step . Further the user seals the container and leaves the substrate in the container for a period of time e.g. 24 hours as indicated in step .
