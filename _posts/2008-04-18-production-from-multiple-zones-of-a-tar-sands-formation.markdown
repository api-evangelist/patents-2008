The Government has certain rights in the invention pursuant to Agreement Nos. SD 10634 and NFE 062050824 between Sandia National Laboratories operating under Agreement DE AC04 94AL85000Sa for the U.S. Department of Energy and Shell Exploration and Production Company.

The present invention relates generally to methods and systems for production of hydrocarbons hydrogen and or other products from various subsurface formations such as hydrocarbon containing formations.

Hydrocarbons obtained from subterranean formations are often used as energy resources as feedstocks and as consumer products. Concerns over depletion of available hydrocarbon resources and concerns over declining overall quality of produced hydrocarbons have led to development of processes for more efficient recovery processing and or use of available hydrocarbon resources. In situ processes may be used to remove hydrocarbon materials from subterranean formations. Chemical and or physical properties of hydrocarbon material in a subterranean formation may need to be changed to allow hydrocarbon material to be more easily removed from the subterranean formation. The chemical and physical changes may include in situ reactions that produce removable fluids composition changes solubility changes density changes phase changes and or viscosity changes of the hydrocarbon material in the formation. A fluid may be but is not limited to a gas a liquid an emulsion a slurry and or a stream of solid particles that has flow characteristics similar to liquid flow.

During some in situ processes wax may be used to reduce vapors and or to encapsulate contaminants in the ground. Wax may be used during remediation of wastes to encapsulate contaminated material. U.S. Pat. No. 7 114 880 to Carter and U.S. Pat. No. 5 879 110 to Carter each of which is incorporated herein by reference describe methods for treatment of contaminants using wax during the remediation procedures.

In some embodiments a casing or other pipe system may be placed or formed in a wellbore. U.S. Pat. No. 4 572 299 issued to Van Egmond et al. which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein describes spooling an electric heater into a well. In some embodiments components of a piping system may be welded together. Quality of formed wells may be monitored by various techniques. In some embodiments quality of welds may be inspected by a hybrid electromagnetic acoustic transmission technique known as EMAT. EMAT is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 652 389 to Schaps et al. 5 760 307 to Latimer et al. 5 777 229 to Geier et al. and 6 155 117 to Stevens et al. each of which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.

In some embodiments an expandable tubular may be used in a wellbore. Expandable tubulars are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 366 012 to Lohbeck and 6 354 373 to Vercaemer et al. each of which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.

Heaters may be placed in wellbores to heat a formation during an in situ process. Examples of in situ processes utilizing downhole heaters are illustrated in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2 634 961 to Ljungstrom 2 732 195 to Ljungstrom 2 780 450 to Ljungstrom 2 789 805 to Ljungstrom 2 923 535 to Ljungstrom and 4 886 118 to Van Meurs et al. each of which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.

Application of heat to oil shale formations is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2 923 535 to Ljungstrom and 4 886 118 to Van Meurs et al. Heat may be applied to the oil shale formation to pyrolyze kerogen in the oil shale formation. The heat may also fracture the formation to increase permeability of the formation. The increased permeability may allow formation fluid to travel to a production well where the fluid is removed from the oil shale formation. In some processes disclosed by Ljungstrom for example an oxygen containing gaseous medium is introduced to a permeable stratum preferably while still hot from a preheating step to initiate combustion.

A heat source may be used to heat a subterranean formation. Electric heaters may be used to heat the subterranean formation by radiation and or conduction. An electric heater may resistively heat an element. U.S. Pat. No. 2 548 360 to Germain which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein describes an electric heating element placed in a viscous oil in a wellbore. The heater element heats and thins the oil to allow the oil to be pumped from the wellbore. U.S. Pat. No. 4 716 960 to Eastlund et al. which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein describes electrically heating tubing of a petroleum well by passing a relatively low voltage current through the tubing to prevent formation of solids. U.S. Pat. No. 5 065 818 to Van Egmond which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein describes an electric heating element that is cemented into a well borehole without a casing surrounding the heating element.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 023 554 to Vinegar et al. which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein describes an electric heating element that is positioned in a casing. The heating element generates radiant energy that heats the casing. A granular solid fill material may be placed between the casing and the formation. The casing may conductively heat the fill material which in turn conductively heats the formation.

The heating element has an electrically conductive core a surrounding layer of insulating material and a surrounding metallic sheath. The conductive core may have a relatively low resistance at high temperatures. The insulating material may have electrical resistance compressive strength and heat conductivity properties that are relatively high at high temperatures. The insulating layer may inhibit arcing from the core to the metallic sheath. The metallic sheath may have tensile strength and creep resistance properties that are relatively high at high temperatures.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 060 287 to Van Egmond which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein describes an electrical heating element having a copper nickel alloy core.

Obtaining permeability in an oil shale formation between injection and production wells tends to be difficult because oil shale is often substantially impermeable. Many methods have attempted to link injection and production wells. These methods include hydraulic fracturing such as methods investigated by Dow Chemical and Laramie Energy Research Center electrical fracturing by methods investigated by Laramie Energy Research Center acid leaching of limestone cavities by methods investigated by Dow Chemical steam injection into permeable nahcolite zones to dissolve the nahcolite by methods investigated by Shell Oil and Equity Oil fracturing with chemical explosives by methods investigated by Talley Energy Systems fracturing with nuclear explosives by methods investigated by Project Bronco and combinations of these methods. Many of these methods however have relatively high operating costs and lack sufficient injection capacity.

Large deposits of heavy hydrocarbons heavy oil and or tar contained in relatively permeable formations for example in tar sands are found in North America South America Africa and Asia. Tar can be surface mined and upgraded to lighter hydrocarbons such as crude oil naphtha kerosene and or gas oil. Surface milling processes may further separate the bitumen from sand. The separated bitumen may be converted to light hydrocarbons using conventional refinery methods. Mining and upgrading tar sand is usually substantially more expensive than producing lighter hydrocarbons from conventional oil reservoirs.

In situ production of hydrocarbons from tar sand may be accomplished by heating and or injecting a gas into the formation. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 211 230 to Ostapovich et al. and 5 339 897 to Leaute which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein describe a horizontal production well located in an oil bearing reservoir. A vertical conduit may be used to inject an oxidant gas into the reservoir for in situ combustion.

U.S. Pat. No. 2 780 450 to Ljungstrom describes heating bituminous geological formations in situ to convert or crack a liquid tar like substance into oils and gases.

U.S. Pat. No. 4 597 441 to Ware et al. which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein describes contacting oil heat and hydrogen simultaneously in a reservoir. Hydrogenation may enhance recovery of oil from the reservoir.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 046 559 to Glandt and U.S. Pat. No. 5 060 726 to Glandt et al. which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein describe preheating a portion of a tar sand formation between an injector well and a producer well. Steam may be injected from the injector well into the formation to produce hydrocarbons at the producer well.

As outlined above there has been a significant amount of effort to develop methods and systems to economically produce hydrocarbons hydrogen and or other products from hydrocarbon containing formations. At present however there are still many hydrocarbon containing formations from which hydrocarbons hydrogen and or other products cannot be economically produced. Thus there is still a need for improved methods and systems for production of hydrocarbons hydrogen and or other products from various hydrocarbon containing formations.

Hydrocarbons in formations may be treated in various ways to produce many different products. In certain embodiments hydrocarbons in formations are treated in stages. depicts an illustration of stages of heating the hydrocarbon containing formation. also depicts an example of yield Y in barrels of oil equivalent per ton y axis of formation fluids from the formation versus temperature T of the heated formation in degrees Celsius x axis .

Desorption of methane and vaporization of water occurs during stage 1 heating. Heating of the formation through stage 1 may be performed as quickly as possible. For example when the hydrocarbon containing formation is initially heated hydrocarbons in the formation desorb adsorbed methane. The desorbed methane may be produced from the formation. If the hydrocarbon containing formation is heated further water in the hydrocarbon containing formation is vaporized. Water may occupy in some hydrocarbon containing formations between 10 and 50 of the pore volume in the formation. In other formations water occupies larger or smaller portions of the pore volume. Water typically is vaporized in a formation between 160 C. and 285 C. at pressures of 600 kPa absolute to 7000 kPa absolute. In some embodiments the vaporized water produces wettability changes in the formation and or increased formation pressure. The wettability changes and or increased pressure may affect pyrolysis reactions or other reactions in the formation. In certain embodiments the vaporized water is produced from the formation. In other embodiments the vaporized water is used for steam extraction and or distillation in the formation or outside the formation. Removing the water from and increasing the pore volume in the formation increases the storage space for hydrocarbons in the pore volume.

In certain embodiments after stage 1 heating the formation is heated further such that a temperature in the formation reaches at least an initial pyrolyzation temperature such as a temperature at the lower end of the temperature range shown as stage 2 . Hydrocarbons in the formation may be pyrolyzed throughout stage 2. A pyrolysis temperature range varies depending on the types of hydrocarbons in the formation. The pyrolysis temperature range may include temperatures between 250 C. and 900 C. The pyrolysis temperature range for producing desired products may extend through only a portion of the total pyrolysis temperature range. In some embodiments the pyrolysis temperature range for producing desired products may include temperatures between 250 C. and 400 C. or temperatures between 270 C. and 350 C. If a temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation is slowly raised through the temperature range from 250 C. to 400 C. production of pyrolysis products may be substantially complete when the temperature approaches 400 C. Average temperature of the hydrocarbons may be raised at a rate of less than 5 C. per day less than 2 C. per day less than 1 C. per day or less than 0.5 C. per day through the pyrolysis temperature range for producing desired products. Heating the hydrocarbon containing formation with a plurality of heat sources may establish thermal gradients around the heat sources that slowly raise the temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation through the pyrolysis temperature range.

The rate of temperature increase through the pyrolysis temperature range for desired products may affect the quality and quantity of the formation fluids produced from the hydrocarbon containing formation. Slowly raising the temperature of the formation through the pyrolysis temperature range for desired products may allow for the production of high quality high API gravity hydrocarbons from the formation. Slowly raising the temperature of the formation through the pyrolysis temperature range for desired products may allow for the removal of a large amount of the hydrocarbons present in the formation as hydrocarbon product.

In some in situ heat treatment embodiments a portion of the formation is heated to a desired temperature instead of slowly heating through a temperature range. In some embodiments the desired temperature is 300 C. 325 C. or 350 C. Other temperatures may be selected as the desired temperature. Superposition of heat from heat sources allows the desired temperature to be relatively quickly and efficiently established in the formation. Energy input into the formation from the heat sources may be adjusted to maintain the temperature in the formation substantially at the desired temperature. The heated portion of the formation is maintained substantially at the desired temperature until pyrolysis declines such that production of desired formation fluids from the formation becomes uneconomical. Parts of the formation that are subjected to pyrolysis may include regions brought into a pyrolysis temperature range by heat transfer from only one heat source.

In certain embodiments formation fluids including pyrolyzation fluids are produced from the formation. As the temperature of the formation increases the amount of condensable hydrocarbons in the produced formation fluid may decrease. At high temperatures the formation may produce mostly methane and or hydrogen. If the hydrocarbon containing formation is heated throughout an entire pyrolysis range the formation may produce only small amounts of hydrogen towards an upper limit of the pyrolysis range. After all of the available hydrogen is depleted a minimal amount of fluid production from the formation will typically occur.

After pyrolysis of hydrocarbons a large amount of carbon and some hydrogen may still be present in the formation. A significant portion of carbon remaining in the formation can be produced from the formation in the form of synthesis gas. Synthesis gas generation may take place during stage 3 heating depicted in . Stage 3 may include heating a hydrocarbon containing formation to a temperature sufficient to allow synthesis gas generation. For example synthesis gas may be produced in a temperature range from about 400 C. to about 1200 C. about 500 C. to about 1100 C. or about 550 C. to about 1000 C. The temperature of the heated portion of the formation when the synthesis gas generating fluid is introduced to the formation determines the composition of synthesis gas produced in the formation. The generated synthesis gas may be removed from the formation through a production well or production wells.

Total energy content of fluids produced from the hydrocarbon containing formation may stay relatively constant throughout pyrolysis and synthesis gas generation. During pyrolysis at relatively low formation temperatures a significant portion of the produced fluid may be condensable hydrocarbons that have a high energy content. At higher pyrolysis temperatures however less of the formation fluid may include condensable hydrocarbons. More non condensable formation fluids may be produced from the formation. Energy content per unit volume of the produced fluid may decline slightly during generation of predominantly non condensable formation fluids. During synthesis gas generation energy content per unit volume of produced synthesis gas declines significantly compared to energy content of pyrolyzation fluid. The volume of the produced synthesis gas however will in many instances increase substantially thereby compensating for the decreased energy content.

Heat sources are placed in at least a portion of the formation. Heat sources may include heaters such as insulated conductors conductor in conduit heaters surface burners flameless distributed combustors and or natural distributed combustors. Heat sources may also include other types of heaters. Heat sources provide heat to at least a portion of the formation to heat hydrocarbons in the formation. Energy may be supplied to heat sources through supply lines . Supply lines may be structurally different depending on the type of heat source or heat sources used to heat the formation. Supply lines for heat sources may transmit electricity for electric heaters may transport fuel for combustors or may transport heat exchange fluid that is circulated in the formation. In some embodiments electricity for an in situ heat treatment process may be provided by a nuclear power plant or nuclear power plants. The use of nuclear power may allow for reduction or elimination of carbon dioxide emissions from the in situ heat treatment process.

When the formation is heated the heat input into the formation may cause expansion of the formation and geomechanical motion. The heat sources may be turned on before at the same time or during a dewatering process. Computer simulations may model formation response to heating. The computer simulations may be used to develop a pattern and time sequence for activating heat sources in the formation so that geomechanical motion of the formation does not adversely affect the functionality of heat sources production wells and other equipment in the formation.

Heating the formation may cause an increase in permeability and or porosity of the formation. Increases in permeability and or porosity may result from a reduction of mass in the formation due to vaporization and removal of water removal of hydrocarbons and or creation of fractures. Fluid may flow more easily in the heated portion of the formation because of the increased permeability and or porosity of the formation. Fluid in the heated portion of the formation may move a considerable distance through the formation because of the increased permeability and or porosity. The considerable distance may be over 1000 m depending on various factors such as permeability of the formation properties of the fluid temperature of the formation and pressure gradient allowing movement of the fluid. The ability of fluid to travel considerable distance in the formation allows production wells to be spaced relatively far apart in the formation.

Production wells are used to remove formation fluid from the formation. In some embodiments production well includes a heat source. The heat source in the production well may heat one or more portions of the formation at or near the production well. In some in situ heat treatment process embodiments the amount of heat supplied to the formation from the production well per meter of the production well is less than the amount of heat applied to the formation from a heat source that heats the formation per meter of the heat source. Heat applied to the formation from the production well may increase formation permeability adjacent to the production well by vaporizing and removing liquid phase fluid adjacent to the production well and or by increasing the permeability of the formation adjacent to the production well by formation of macro and or micro fractures.

More than one heat source may be positioned in the production well. A heat source in a lower portion of the production well may be turned off when superposition of heat from adjacent heat sources heats the formation sufficiently to counteract benefits provided by heating the formation with the production well. In some embodiments the heat source in an upper portion of the production well may remain on after the heat source in the lower portion of the production well is deactivated. The heat source in the upper portion of the well may inhibit condensation and reflux of formation fluid.

In some embodiments the heat source in production well allows for vapor phase removal of formation fluids from the formation. Providing heating at or through the production well may 1 inhibit condensation and or refluxing of production fluid when such production fluid is moving in the production well proximate the overburden 2 increase heat input into the formation 3 increase production rate from the production well as compared to a production well without a heat source 4 inhibit condensation of high carbon number compounds C6 and above in the production well and or 5 increase formation permeability at or proximate the production well.

Subsurface pressure in the formation may correspond to the fluid pressure generated in the formation. As temperatures in the heated portion of the formation increase the pressure in the heated portion may increase as a result of thermal expansion of in situ fluids increased fluid generation and vaporization of water. Controlling rate of fluid removal from the formation may allow for control of pressure in the formation. Pressure in the formation may be determined at a number of different locations such as near or at production wells near or at heat sources or at monitor wells.

In some hydrocarbon containing formations production of hydrocarbons from the formation is inhibited until at least some hydrocarbons in the formation have been pyrolyzed. Formation fluid may be produced from the formation when the formation fluid is of a selected quality. In some embodiments the selected quality includes an API gravity of at least about 20 30 or 40 . Inhibiting production until at least some hydrocarbons are pyrolyzed may increase conversion of heavy hydrocarbons to light hydrocarbons. Inhibiting initial production may minimize the production of heavy hydrocarbons from the formation. Production of substantial amounts of heavy hydrocarbons may require expensive equipment and or reduce the life of production equipment.

In some hydrocarbon containing formations hydrocarbons in the formation may be heated to pyrolysis temperatures before substantial permeability has been generated in the heated portion of the formation. An initial lack of permeability may inhibit the transport of generated fluids to production wells . During initial heating fluid pressure in the formation may increase proximate heat sources . The increased fluid pressure may be released monitored altered and or controlled through one or more heat sources . For example selected heat sources or separate pressure relief wells may include pressure relief valves that allow for removal of some fluid from the formation.

In some embodiments pressure generated by expansion of pyrolysis fluids or other fluids generated in the formation may be allowed to increase although an open path to production wells or any other pressure sink may not yet exist in the formation. The fluid pressure may be allowed to increase towards a lithostatic pressure. Fractures in the hydrocarbon containing formation may form when the fluid approaches the lithostatic pressure. For example fractures may form from heat sources to production wells in the heated portion of the formation. The generation of fractures in the heated portion may relieve some of the pressure in the portion. Pressure in the formation may have to be maintained below a selected pressure to inhibit unwanted production fracturing of the overburden or underburden and or coking of hydrocarbons in the formation.

After pyrolysis temperatures are reached and production from the formation is allowed pressure in the formation may be varied to alter and or control a composition of formation fluid produced to control a percentage of condensable fluid as compared to non condensable fluid in the formation fluid and or to control an API gravity of formation fluid being produced. For example decreasing pressure may result in production of a larger condensable fluid component. The condensable fluid component may contain a larger percentage of olefins.

In some in situ heat treatment process embodiments pressure in the formation may be maintained high enough to promote production of formation fluid with an API gravity of greater than 20 . Maintaining increased pressure in the formation may inhibit formation subsidence during in situ heat treatment. Maintaining increased pressure may facilitate vapor phase production of fluids from the formation. Vapor phase production may allow for a reduction in size of collection conduits used to transport fluids produced from the formation. Maintaining increased pressure may reduce or eliminate the need to compress formation fluids at the surface to transport the fluids in collection conduits to treatment facilities.

Maintaining increased pressure in a heated portion of the formation may surprisingly allow for production of large quantities of hydrocarbons of increased quality and of relatively low molecular weight. Pressure may be maintained so that formation fluid produced has a minimal amount of compounds above a selected carbon number. The selected carbon number may be at most 25 at most 20 at most 12 or at most 8. Some high carbon number compounds may be entrained in vapor in the formation and may be removed from the formation with the vapor. Maintaining increased pressure in the formation may inhibit entrainment of high carbon number compounds and or multi ring hydrocarbon compounds in the vapor. High carbon number compounds and or multi ring hydrocarbon compounds may remain in a liquid phase in the formation for significant time periods. The significant time periods may provide sufficient time for the compounds to pyrolyze to form lower carbon number compounds.

Generation of relatively low molecular weight hydrocarbons is believed to be due in part to autogenous generation and reaction of hydrogen in a portion of the hydrocarbon containing formation. For example maintaining an increased pressure may force hydrogen generated during pyrolysis into the liquid phase within the formation. Heating the portion to a temperature in a pyrolysis temperature range may pyrolyze hydrocarbons in the formation to generate liquid phase pyrolyzation fluids. The generated liquid phase pyrolyzation fluids components may include double bonds and or radicals. Hydrogen H in the liquid phase may reduce double bonds of the generated pyrolyzation fluids thereby reducing a potential for polymerization or formation of long chain compounds from the generated pyrolyzation fluids. In addition Hmay also neutralize radicals in the generated pyrolyzation fluids. Therefore Hin the liquid phase may inhibit the generated pyrolyzation fluids from reacting with each other and or with other compounds in the formation.

Formation fluid produced from production wells may be transported through collection piping to treatment facilities . Formation fluids may also be produced from heat sources . For example fluid may be produced from heat sources to control pressure in the formation adjacent to the heat sources. Fluid produced from heat sources may be transported through tubing or piping to collection piping or the produced fluid may be transported through tubing or piping directly to treatment facilities . Treatment facilities may include separation units reaction units upgrading units fuel cells turbines storage vessels and or other systems and units for processing produced formation fluids. The treatment facilities may form transportation fuel from at least a portion of the hydrocarbons produced from the formation. In some embodiments the transportation fuel may be jet fuel such as JP 8.

Formation fluid may be hot when produced from the formation through the production wells. Hot formation fluid may be produced during solution mining processes and or during in situ heat treatment processes. In some embodiments electricity may be generated using the heat of the fluid produced from the formation. Also heat recovered from the formation after the in situ process may be used to generate electricity. The generated electricity may be used to supply power to the in situ heat treatment process. For example the electricity may be used to power heaters or to power a refrigeration system for forming or maintaining a low temperature barrier. Electricity may be generated using a Kalina cycle Rankine cycle or other thermodynamic cycle. In some embodiments the working fluid for the cycle used to generate electricity is aqua ammonia.

In some embodiments cryogenic separation unit is about 2.1 m tall and includes 20 distillation stages. Temperatures in cryogenic separation unit may range from about 56 C. to about 96 C. at a pressure of about 45 bar.

Carbon dioxide stream may include some hydrogen sulfide. For example carbon dioxide stream may include about 80 ppm of hydrogen sulfide. At least a portion of carbon dioxide stream may be used as a heat exchange medium in heat exchanger . In some embodiments at least a portion of carbon dioxide stream is sequestered in the formation and or at least a portion of the carbon dioxide stream is used as a diluent in downhole oxidizer assemblies.

Hydrocarbon hydrogen sulfide stream may include hydrocarbons having a carbon number of at least 2 and hydrogen sulfide. Hydrocarbon hydrogen sulfide stream may pass through heat exchanger and enter separation unit . In separation unit hydrocarbon hydrogen sulfide stream may be separated into hydrocarbon stream and hydrogen sulfide stream .

In some embodiments substantial removal of all the hydrogen sulfide from the Chydrocarbons is desired. Chydrocarbons may be used as an energy source in surface facilities. Recovery of Chydrocarbons may enhance the energy efficiency of the process. Separation of hydrogen sulfide from Chydrocarbons may be difficult because Chydrocarbons boil at approximately the same temperature as a hydrogen sulfide Chydrocarbons mixture. Addition of higher molecular weight higher boiling hydrocarbons does not enable the separation between hydrogen sulfide and Chydrocarbons as the addition of higher molecular weight hydrocarbons decreases the volatility of the Chydrocarbons. It has been advantageously found that the addition of carbon dioxide to the hydrogen sulfide Chydrocarbons mixture allows separation of hydrogen sulfide from the Chydrocarbons.

As shown in bottoms stream bottoms stream and carbon dioxide stream enter cryogenic separation unit .

Hydrocarbon stream enters hydrotreating unit . In hydrotreating unit liquid stream may be hydrotreated to form compounds suitable for processing to hydrogen and or commercial products.

Liquid hydrocarbon stream from liquid separation unit may include hydrocarbons having a boiling point up to 260 C. Liquid hydrocarbon stream may include entrained asphaltenes and or other compounds that may contribute to the instability of hydrocarbon streams. For example liquid hydrocarbon stream is a naphtha kerosene fraction that includes entrained partially dissolved and or dissolved asphaltenes and or high molecular weight compounds that may contribute to phase instability of the liquid hydrocarbon stream. In some embodiments liquid hydrocarbon stream may include at least 0.5 by weight asphaltenes 1 by weight asphaltenes or at least 5 by weight asphaltenes.

As properties of the liquid hydrocarbon stream are changed during processing for example TAN asphaltenes P value olefin content mobilized fluids content visbroken fluids content pyrolyzed fluids content or combinations thereof the asphaltenes and other components may become less soluble in the liquid hydrocarbon stream. In some instances components in the produced fluids and or components in the separated hydrocarbons may form two phases and or become insoluble. Formation of two phases through flocculation of asphaltenes change in concentration of components in the produced fluids change in concentration of components in separated hydrocarbons and or precipitation of components may cause processing problems for example plugging and or result in hydrocarbons that do not meet pipeline transportation and or refining specifications. In some embodiments further treatment of the produced fluids and or separated hydrocarbons is necessary to produce products with desired properties.

During processing the P value of the separated hydrocarbons may be monitored and the stability of the produced fluids and or separated hydrocarbons may be assessed. Typically a P value that is at most 1.0 indicates that flocculation of asphaltenes from the separated hydrocarbons may occur. If the P value is initially at least 1.0 and such P value increases or is relatively stable during heating then this indicates that the separated hydrocarbons are relatively stable.

Liquid hydrocarbon stream may be treated to at least partially remove asphaltenes and or other compounds that may contribute to instability. Removal of the asphaltenes and or other compounds that may contribute to instability may inhibit plugging in downstream processing units. Removal of the asphaltenes and or other compounds that may contribute to instability may enhance processing unit efficiencies and or prevent plugging of transportation pipelines.

Liquid hydrocarbon stream may enter filtration system . Filtration system separates at least a portion of the asphaltenes and or other compounds that contribute to instability from liquid hydrocarbon stream . In some embodiments filtration system is skid mounted. Skid mounting filtration system may allow the filtration system to be moved from one processing unit to another. In some embodiments filtration system includes one or more membrane separators for example one or more nanofiltration membranes or one or more reverse osmosis membranes. Use of a filtration system that operates at below ambient ambient or slightly higher than ambient temperatures may reduce energy costs as compared to conventional catalytic and or thermal methods to remove asphaltenes from a hydrocarbon stream.

The membranes may be ceramic membranes and or polymeric membranes. The ceramic membranes may be ceramic membranes having a molecular weight cut off of at most 2000 Daltons Da at most 1000 Da or at most 500 Da. Ceramic membranes may not swell during removal of the desired materials from a substrate for example asphaltenes from the liquid stream . In addition ceramic membranes may be used at elevated temperatures. Examples of ceramic membranes include but are not limited to mesoporous titania mesoporous gamma alumina mesoporous zirconia mesoporous silica and combinations thereof.

Polymeric membranes may include top layers made of a dense membrane and a base layers supports made of porous membranes. The polymeric membranes may be arranged to allow the liquid stream permeate to flow first through the dense membrane top layer and then through the base layer so that the pressure difference over the membrane pushes the top layer onto the base layer. The polymeric membranes are organophilic or hydrophobic membranes so that water present in the liquid stream is retained or substantially retained in the retentate.

The dense membrane layer of the polymeric membrane may separate at least a portion or substantially all of the asphaltenes from liquid hydrocarbon stream . In some embodiments the dense polymeric membrane has properties such that liquid hydrocarbon stream passes through the membrane by dissolving in and diffusing through the structure of dense membrane. At least a portion of the asphaltenes may not dissolve and or diffuse through the dense membrane thus they are removed. The asphaltenes may not dissolve and or diffuse through the dense membrane because of the complex structure of the asphaltenes and or their high molecular weight. The dense membrane layer may include cross linked structure as described in WO 96 27430 to Schmidt et al. which is incorporated by reference herein. A thickness of the dense membrane layer may range from 1 micrometer to 15 micrometers from 2 micrometers to 10 micrometers or from 3 micrometers to 5 micrometers.

The dense membrane may be made from polysiloxane poly di methyl siloxane poly octyl methyl siloxane polyimide polyaramide poly tri methyl silyl propyne or mixtures thereof. Porous base layers may be made of materials that provide mechanical strength to the membrane. The porous base layers may be any porous membranes used for ultra filtration nanofiltration and or reverse osmosis. Examples of such materials are polyacrylonitrile polyamideimide in combination with titanium oxide polyetherimide polyvinylidenedifluoroide polytetrafluoroethylene or combinations thereof.

During separation of asphaltenes from liquid stream the pressure difference across the membrane may range from about 0.5 MPa to about 6 MPa from about 1 MPa to about 5 MPa or from about 2 MPa to about 4 MPa. A temperature of the unit during separation may range from the pour point of liquid hydrocarbon stream up to 100 C. from about 20 C. to about 100 C. from about 10 C. to about 90 C. or from about 20 C. to about 85 C. During a continuous operation the permeate flux rate may be at most 50 of the initial flux at most 70 of the initial flux or at most 90 of the initial flux. A weight recovery of the permeate on feed may range from about 50 by weight to 97 by weight from about 60 by weight to 90 by weight or from about 70 by weight to 80 by weight.

Filtration system may include one or more membrane separators. The membrane separators may include one or more membrane modules. When two or more membrane separators are used the separators may be arranged in a parallel configuration to allow feed retentate from a first membrane separator to flow into a second membrane separator. Examples of membrane modules include but are not limited to spirally wound modules plate and frame modules hollow fibers and tubular modules. Membrane modules are described in Encyclopedia of Chemical Engineering 4Ed. 1995 John Wiley Sons Inc. Vol. 16 pages 158 164. Examples of spirally wound modules are described in for example WO 2006 040307 to Boestert et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 102 551 to Pasternak U.S. Pat. No. 5 093 002 to Pasternak U.S. Pat. No. 5 275 726 to Feimer et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 458 774 to Mannapperuma and U.S. Pat. No. 5 150 118 to Finkle et al all of which are incorporated by reference herein.

In some embodiments a spirally wound module is used when a dense membrane is used in filtration system . A spirally wound module may include a membrane assembly of two membrane sheets between which a permeate spacer sheet is sandwiched. The membrane assembly may be sealed at three sides. The fourth side is connected to a permeate outlet conduit such that the area between the membranes is in fluid communication with the interior of the conduit. A feed spacer sheet may be arranged on top of one of the membranes. The assembly with feed spacer sheet is rolled up around the permeate outlet conduit to form a substantially cylindrical spirally wound membrane module. The feed spacer may have a thickness of at least 0.6 mm at least 1 mm or at least 3 mm to allow sufficient membrane surface to be packed into the spirally wound module. In some embodiments the feed spacer is a woven feed spacer. During operation the feed mixture may be passed from one end of the cylindrical module between the membrane assemblies along the feed spacer sheet sandwiched between feed sides of the membranes. Part of the feed mixture passes through either one of the membrane sheets to the permeate side. The resulting permeate flows along the permeate spacer sheet into the permeate outlet conduit.

In some embodiments the membrane separation is a continuous process. Liquid stream passes over the membrane due to the pressure difference to obtain filtered liquid stream permeate and or recycle liquid stream retentate . In some embodiments filtered liquid stream may have reduced concentrations of asphaltenes and or high molecular weight compounds that may contribute to phase instability. Continuous recycling of recycle liquid stream through the filter system can increase the production of filtered liquid stream to as much as 95 of the original volume of filtered liquid stream . Recycle liquid stream may be continuously recycled through a spirally wound membrane module for at least 10 hours for at least one day or for at least one week without cleaning the feed side of the membrane.

Aromatic rich stream may suitable for use as a diluent for undesirable streams that may not otherwise be suitable for additional processing. The undesirable streams may have low P values phase instability and or asphaltenes. Addition of aromatic rich stream to the undesirable streams may allow the undesirable streams to be processed and or transported thus increasing the economic value of the stream undesirable streams. Aromatic rich stream may be sold as a diluent and or used as a diluent for produced fluids. All or a portion of aromatic rich stream may be recycled to separation unit .

The polymeric membrane includes a top layer made of a dense membrane and a base layer support made of a porous membrane. The polymeric membrane may be arranged to allow the liquid stream permeate to flow first through the dense membrane top layer and then through the base layer so that the pressure difference over the membrane pushes the top layer onto the base layer. The dense polymeric membrane has properties such that as liquid hydrocarbon stream passes through the membrane aromatic hydrocarbons are selectively separated from the liquid hydrocarbon stream to form aromatic rich stream . In some embodiments the dense membrane layer may separate at least a portion of or substantially all of the aromatics from liquid hydrocarbon stream . The dense membrane may be a silicon based membrane a polyamide based membrane and or a polyol membrane. Aromatic selective membranes may be purchased from W. R. Grace Co. New York USA PolyAn Berlin Germany and or Borsig Membrane Technology Berlin Germany .

Liquid stream retentate from membrane separation unit may be recycled back to the membrane separation unit. Continuous recycling of recycle liquid stream idem through nanofiltration system can increase the production of aromatic rich stream to as much as 95 of the original volume of the filtered liquid stream. Recycle liquid stream may be continuously recycled through a spirally wound membrane module for at least 10 hours for at least one day for at least one week or until the desired content of aromatics in aromatic rich stream is obtained. Upon completion of the filtration or when the retentate includes an acceptable amount of aromatics liquid stream retentate from separation unit may be sent to hydrotreating unit and or other processing units.

Membranes of separation unit may be ceramic membranes and or polymeric membranes. During separation of aromatic hydrocarbons from liquid stream in separation unit the pressure difference across the membrane may range from about 0.5 MPa to about 6 MPa from about 1 MPa to about 5 MPa or from about 2 MPa to about 4 MPa. Temperature of separation unit during separation may range from the pour point of the liquid hydrocarbon stream up to 100 C. from about 20 C. to about 100 C. from about 10 C. to about 90 C. or from about 20 C. to about 85 C. During a continuous operation the permeate flux rate may be at most 50 of the initial flux at most 70 of the initial flux or at most 90 of the initial flux. A weight recovery of the permeate on feed may range from about 50 by weight to 97 by weight from about 60 by weight to 90 by weight or from about 70 by weight to 80 by weight.

As shown in and liquid stream and or filtered liquid stream may enter hydrotreating unit . In some embodiments hydrogen source enters hydrotreating unit in addition to liquid stream and or filtered liquid stream . In some embodiments the hydrogen source is not needed. Liquid stream and or filtered liquid stream may be selectively hydrogenated in hydrotreating unit such that di olefins are reduced to mono olefins. For example liquid stream and or filtered liquid stream is contacted with hydrogen in the presence of DN 200 Criterion Catalysts Technologies Houston Tex. U.S.A. at temperatures ranging from 100 C. to 200 C. and total pressures of 0.1 MPa to 40 MPa to produce liquid stream . In some embodiments filtered liquid stream is hydrotreated at a temperature ranging from about 190 C. to about 200 C. at a pressure of at least 6 MPa. Liquid stream includes a reduced content of di olefins and an increased content of mono olefins relative to the di olefin and mono olefin content of liquid stream . The conversion of di olefins to mono olefins under these conditions is in some embodiments at least 50 at least 60 at least 80 or at least 90 . Liquid stream exits hydrotreating unit and enters one or more processing units positioned downstream of hydrotreating unit . The units positioned downstream of hydrotreating unit may include distillation units catalytic reforming units hydrocracking units hydrotreating units hydrogenation units hydrodesulfurization units catalytic cracking units delayed coking units gasification units or combinations thereof. In some embodiments hydrotreating prior to fractionation is not necessary. In some embodiments liquid stream may be severely hydrotreated to remove undesired compounds from the liquid stream prior to fractionation. In certain embodiments liquid stream may be fractionated and then produced streams may each be hydrotreated to meet industry standards and or transportation standards.

Liquid stream may exit hydrotreating unit and enter fractionation unit . In fractionation unit liquid stream may be distilled to form one or more crude products. Crude products include but are not limited to C Chydrocarbon stream naphtha stream kerosene stream diesel stream and bottoms stream . Fractionation unit may be operated at atmospheric and or under vacuum conditions.

In some embodiments hydrotreated liquid streams and or streams produced from fractions for example aromatic rich streams distillates and or naphtha are blended with the in situ heat treatment process liquid and or formation fluid to produce a blended fluid. The blended fluid may have enhanced physical stability and chemical stability as compared to the formation fluid. The blended fluid may have a reduced amount of reactive species for example di olefins other olefins and or compounds containing oxygen sulfur and or nitrogen relative to the formation fluid. Thus chemical stability of the blended fluid is enhanced. The blended fluid may decrease an amount of asphaltenes relative to the formation fluid. Thus physical stability of the blended fluid is enhanced. The blended fluid may be a more a fungible feed than the formation fluid and or the liquid stream produced from the in situ heat treatment process. The blended feed may be more suitable for transportation for use in chemical processing units and or for use in refining units than formation fluid.

In some embodiments a fluid produced by methods described herein from an oil shale formation may be blended with heavy oil tar sands in situ heat treatment process IHTP fluid. Since the oil shale liquid is substantially paraffinic and the heavy oil tar sands IHTP fluid is substantially aromatic the blended fluid exhibits enhanced stability. In certain embodiments in situ heat treatment process fluid may be blended with bitumen to obtain a feed suitable for use in refining units. Blending the IHTP fluid and or bitumen with the produced fluid may enhance the chemical and or physical stability of the blended product. Thus the blend may be transported and or distributed to processing units.

In some embodiments hydrocarbon stream is suitable for use as gasoline without further processing.

In some embodiments and as depicted in bottoms stream may be hydrocracked to produce naphtha and or other products. The resulting naphtha may however need reformation to alter the octane level so that the product may be sold commercially as gasoline. Alternatively bottoms stream may be treated in a catalytic cracker to produce naphtha and or feed for an alkylation unit. In some embodiments naphtha stream kerosene stream and diesel stream have an imbalance of paraffinic hydrocarbons olefinic hydrocarbons and or aromatic hydrocarbons. The streams may not have a suitable quantity of olefins and or aromatics for use in commercial products. This imbalance may be changed by combining at least a portion of the streams to form combined stream which has a boiling range distribution from about 38 C. to about 343 C. Catalytically cracking combined stream may produce olefins and or other streams suitable for use in an alkylation unit and or other processing units. In some embodiments naphtha stream is hydrocracked to produce olefins.

Combined stream and bottoms stream from fractionation unit enters catalytic cracking unit . Under controlled cracking conditions for example controlled temperatures and pressures catalytic cracking unit produces additional C Chydrocarbon stream gasoline hydrocarbons stream and additional kerosene stream .

Additional C Chydrocarbon stream may be sent to alkylation unit combined with C Chydrocarbon stream and or combined with hydrocarbon gas stream to produce gasoline suitable for commercial sale. In some embodiments the olefin content in hydrocarbon gas stream is acceptable and an additional source of olefins is not needed.

Many wells are needed for treating the hydrocarbon formation using the in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments vertical or substantially vertical wells are formed in the formation. In some embodiments horizontal or U shaped wells are formed in the formation. In some embodiments combinations of horizontal and vertical wells are formed in the formation.

A manufacturing approach for the formation of wellbores in the formation may be used due to the large number of wells that need to be formed for the in situ heat treatment process. The manufacturing approach may be particularly applicable for forming wells for in situ heat treatment processes that utilize u shaped wells or other types of wells that have long non vertically oriented sections. Surface openings for the wells may be positioned in lines running along one or two sides of the treatment area. depicts a schematic representation of an embodiment of a system for forming wellbores of the in situ heat treatment process.

The manufacturing approach for the formation of wellbores may include 1 delivering flat rolled steel to near site tube manufacturing plant that forms coiled tubulars and or pipe for surface pipelines 2 manufacturing large diameter coiled tubing that is tailored to the required well length using electrical resistance welding ERW wherein the coiled tubing has customized ends for the bottom hole assembly BHA and hang off at the wellhead 3 deliver the coiled tubing to a drilling rig on a large diameter reel 4 drill to total depth with coil and a retrievable bottom hole assembly 5 at total depth disengage the coil and hang the coil on the wellhead 6 retrieve the BHA 7 launch an expansion cone to expand the coil against the formation 8 return empty spool to the tube manufacturing plant to accept a new length of coiled tubing 9 move the gantry type drilling platform to the next well location and 10 repeat.

In situ heat treatment process locations may be distant from established cities and transportation networks. Transporting formed pipe or coiled tubing for wellbores to the in situ process location may be untenable due to the lengths and quantity of tubulars needed for the in situ heat treatment process. One or more tube manufacturing facilities may be formed at or near to the in situ heat treatment process location. The tubular manufacturing facility may form plate steel into coiled tubing. The plate steel may be delivered to tube manufacturing facilities by truck train ship or other transportation system. In some embodiments different sections of the coiled tubing may be formed of different alloys. The tubular manufacturing facility may use ERW to longitudinally weld the coiled tubing.

Tube manufacturing facilities may be able to produce tubing having various diameters. Tube manufacturing facilities may initially be used to produce coiled tubing for forming wellbores. The tube manufacturing facilities may also be used to produce heater components piping for transporting formation fluid to surface facilities and other piping and tubing needs for the in situ heat treatment process.

Tube manufacturing facilities may produce coiled tubing used to form wellbores in the formation. The coiled tubing may have a large diameter. The diameter of the coiled tubing may be from about 4 inches to about 8 inches in diameter. In some embodiments the diameter of the coiled tubing is about 6 inches in diameter. The coiled tubing may be placed on large diameter reels. Large diameter reels may be needed due to the large diameter of the tubing. The diameter of the reel may be from about 10 m to about 50 m. One reel may hold all of the tubing needed for completing a single well to total depth.

In some embodiments tube manufacturing facilities has the ability to apply expandable zonal inflow profiler EZIP material to one or more sections of the tubing that the facility produces. The EZIP material may be placed on portions of the tubing that are to be positioned near and next to aquifers or high permeability layers in the formation. When activated the EZIP material forms a seal against the formation that may serve to inhibit migration of formation fluid between different layers. The use of EZIP layers may inhibit saline formation fluid from mixing with non saline formation fluid.

The size of the reels used to hold the coiled tubing may prohibit transport of the reel using standard moving equipment and roads. Because tube manufacturing facility is at or near the in situ heat treatment location the equipment used to move the coiled tubing to the well sites does not have to meet existing road transportation regulations and can be designed to move large reels of tubing. In some embodiments the equipment used to move the reels of tubing is similar to cargo gantries used to move shipping containers at ports and other facilities. In some embodiments the gantries are wheeled units. In some embodiments the coiled tubing may be moved using a rail system or other transportation system.

The coiled tubing may be moved from the tubing manufacturing facility to the well site using gantries . Drilling gantry may be used at the well site. Several drilling gantries may be used to form wellbores at different locations. Supply systems for drilling fluid or other needs may be coupled to drilling gantries from central facilities .

Drilling gantry or other equipment may be used to set the conductor for the well. Drilling gantry takes coiled tubing passes the coiled tubing through a straightener and a BHA attached to the tubing is used to drill the wellbore to depth. In some embodiments a composite coil is positioned in the coiled tubing at tube manufacturing facility . The composite coil allows the wellbore to be formed without having drilling fluid flowing between the formation and the tubing. The composite coil also allows the BHA to be retrieved from the wellbore. The composite coil may be pulled from the tubing after wellbore formation. The composite coil may be returned to the tubing manufacturing facility to be placed in another length of coiled tubing. In some embodiments the BHAs are not retrieved from the wellbores.

In some embodiments drilling gantry takes the reel of coiled tubing from gantry . In some embodiments gantry is coupled to drilling gantry during the formation of the wellbore. For example the coiled tubing may be fed from gantry to drilling gantry or the drilling gantry lifts the gantry to a feed position and the tubing is fed from the gantry to the drilling gantry.

The wellbore may be formed using the bottom hole assembly coiled tubing and the drilling gantry. The BHA may be self seeking to the destination. The BHA may form the opening at a fast rate. In some embodiments the BHA forms the opening at a rate of about 100 meters per hour.

After the wellbore is drilled to total depth the tubing may be suspended from the wellhead. An expansion cone may be used to expand the tubular against the formation. In some embodiments the drilling gantry is used to install a heater and or other equipment in the wellbore.

When drilling gantry is finished at well site the drilling gantry may release gantry with the empty reel or return the empty reel to the gantry. Gantry may take the empty reel back to tube manufacturing facility to be loaded with another coiled tube. Gantries may move on looped path from tube manufacturing facility to well sites and back to the tube manufacturing facility.

Drilling gantry may be moved to the next well site. Global positioning satellite information lasers and or other information may be used to position the drilling gantry at desired locations. Additional wellbores may be formed until all of the wellbores for the in situ heat treatment process are formed.

In some embodiments positioning and or tracking system may be utilized to track gantries drilling gantries coiled tubing reels and other equipment and materials used to develop the in situ heat treatment location. Tracking systems may include bar code tracking systems to ensure equipment and materials arrive where and when needed.

Directionally drilled wellbores may be formed using steerable motors. Deviations in wellbore trajectory may be made using a slide drilling systems or using rotary steerable systems RSS . During use of slide drilling systems the mud motor rotates the bit downhole with little or no rotation of the drilling string from the surface during trajectory changes. The BHA is fitted with a bent sub and or a bent housing mud motor for directional drilling. The bent sub and the drill bit are oriented in the desired direction. With little or no rotation of the drilling string the drill bit is rotated with the mud motor to set the trajectory. When the desired trajectory is obtained the entire drilling string is rotated and drills straight rather than at an angle. Drill bit direction changes may be made by utilizing torque rotary tweaking to nudge the drill bit in the desired direction. depicts time at drilling string rotation during direction change versus rotation speed rpm of the drilling string for a conventional steerable motor BHA during a drill bit direction change.

By controlling the amount of wellbore drilled in the sliding and rotating modes the wellbore trajectory can be controlled. Torque and drag during sliding and rotating modes may limit the capabilities of slide mode drilling. Steerable motors may produce tortuosity in the slide mode. Tortuosity may make further sliding more difficult. Many methods have been developed or are being developed to improve on slide drilling systems. Examples of improvements to slide drilling systems include agitators low weight bits slippery muds and torque toolface control systems.

Limitations inherent in slide drilling led to the development of rotary steerable systems RSS . RSS drilling drills directionally with continuous rotation from the surface. There is no need to slide the drilling string. Continuous rotation transfers weight to the drill bit more efficiently thus increasing the rate of penetration. Current RSS systems may be mechanically and or electrically complicated with a high cost of delivery due to service companies requiring a high rate of return and due to relatively high failure rates for the systems.

In an embodiment a dual motor RSS is used. The dual motor RSS allows a bent sub and or bent housing mud motor to change the trajectory of the drilling while the drilling string remains in rotary mode. The dual motor RSS uses a second motor in the bottom hole assembly BHA to rotate a portion of the BHA in a direction opposite to the direction of rotation of the drilling string. The addition of the second motor may allow continuous forward rotation of a drilling string while simultaneously controlling the drill bit and thus the directional response of the BHA. Drill bit control may be achieved with the rotation speed of the drilling string.

Motor B may rotate in a direction opposite to the rotation of drilling string . Thus portions of BHA beyond motor B have less rotation in the direction of rotation of drilling string due to motor B. The revolutions per minute rpm versus differential pressure relationship for BHA may be assessed prior to running drilling string and the BHA in the formation to determine the differential pressure at neutral drilling speed i.e. when the drilling string speed is equal and opposite to the speed of motor B . Measured differential pressure may be used by a control system during drilling to control the speed of the drilling string relative to the neutral drilling speed.

In some embodiments motor B is operated at a substantially fixed speed. For example motor B may be operated at a speed of 30 rpm. Other speeds may be used as desired.

The rotation speed of drilling string may be used to control the trajectory of the wellbore being formed. For example drilling string may initially be rotating at 40 rpm and motor B rotates at 30 rpm. The counter rotation of motor B and drilling string results in a forward rotation speed of 10 rpm in the lower portion of BHA the portion of the BHA below motor B . When a directional course correction is to be made the speed of drilling string is changed to the neutral drilling speed. Because drilling string is rotating there is no need to lift drill bit off the bottom of the borehole. Operating at neutral drilling speed may effectively cancel the torque of the drilling string so that drill bit is subjected to torque induced by motor A and the formation.

The continuous rotation of drilling string keeps windup of the drilling string consistent and stabilizes drill bit . Directional changes of drill bit may be made by changing the speed of drilling string . Using a dual motor RSS system allows the changing of the direction of the drilling string to occur while the drilling string rotates at or near the normal operating rotation speed of drilling string . depicts time at rotation speed during directional change versus change in drilling string rotating speed for the dual motor drilling string during the drill bit direction change. Drill bit control is substantially the same as for conventional slide mode drilling where torque rotary tweaking is used to nudge the drill bit in the desired direction but 0 on the x axis of becomes N in the neutral drilling string speed .

The connection of BHA to drilling string of the dual motor RSS system depicted in may be subjected to the net effect of all the torque components required to rotate the entire BHA including torque generated at drill bit during wellbore formation . Threaded connections along drilling string may include profile matched sleeves such as those known in the art for utilities drilling systems.

In some embodiments the control system used to control wellbore formation includes a system that sets a desired rotation speed of drilling string when direction changes in trajectory of the wellbore are to be implemented. The system may include fine tuning of the desired drilling string rotation speed.

In certain embodiments drilling string is integrated with position measurement and down hole tools for example sensing array to autonomously control the hole path along a designed geometry. An autonomous control system for controlling the path of drilling string may utilize at least three domains of functionality measurement trajectory and control. Measurement may be made using sensor systems and or other equipment hardware that assess angles distances magnetic fields and or other data. Trajectory may include flight path calculation and algorithms that utilize physical measurements to calculate angular and spatial offsets from the design of the drilling string. The control system may implement actions to keep the drilling string in the proper path. The control system may include tools that utilize software control interfaces built into an operating system of in the drilling equipment drilling string and or BHA.

In certain embodiments the control system utilizes position and angle measurements to define spatial and angular offsets from the desired drilling geometry. The defined offsets may be used to determine a steering solution to move the trajectory of the drilling string thus the trajectory of the borehole back into convergence with the desired drilling geometry. The steering solution may be based on an optimum alignment solution in which a desired rate of curvature of the borehole path is set and required angle change segments and angle change directions for the path are assessed for example by computation .

In some embodiments the control system uses a fixed angle change rate associated with the drilling string assesses the lengths of the sections of the drilling string and assesses the desired directions of the drilling to autonomously execute and control movement of the drilling string. Thus the control system assesses position measurements and controls of the drilling string to control the direction of the drilling string.

In some embodiments differential pressure or torque across motor A and or motor B is used to control the rate of penetration ROP . A relationship between ROP weight on bit WOB and torque may be assessed for drilling string . Measurements of torque and the ROP WOB torque relationship may be used to control the feed rate the ROP of drilling string into the formation.

Second wellbore B may be formed in the subsurface formation with drill bit on drilling string . In certain embodiments drilling string includes one or more magnets . Wellbore B may be formed in a selected relationship to wellbore A. In certain embodiments wellbore B is formed substantially parallel to wellbore A. In other embodiments wellbore B is formed at other angles relative to wellbore A. In some embodiments wellbore B is formed perpendicular relative to wellbore A.

In certain embodiments wellbore A includes sensing array . Sensing array may include two or more sensors . Sensors may sense magnetic fields produced by magnets in wellbore B. The sensed magnetic fields may be used to assess a position of wellbore A relative to wellbore B. In some embodiments sensors measure two or more magnetic fields provided by magnets .

Two or more sensors in wellbore A may allow for continuous assessment of the relative position of wellbore A versus wellbore B. Using two or more sensors in wellbore A may also allow the sensors to be used as gradiometers. In some embodiments sensors are positioned in advance ahead of magnets . Positioning sensors in advance of magnets allows the magnets to traverse past the sensors so that the magnet s position the position of wellbore B is measurable continuously or live during drilling of wellbore B. Sensing array may be moved intermittently at selected intervals to move sensors ahead of magnets . Positioning sensors in advance of magnets also allows the sensors to measure store and zero the Earth s field before sensing the magnetic fields of the magnets. The Earth s field may be zeroed by for example using a null function before arrival of the magnets calculating background components from a known sensor attitude or using a gradiometer setup.

The relative position of wellbore B versus wellbore A may be used to adjust the drilling of wellbore B using drilling string . For example the direction of drilling for wellbore B may be adjusted so that wellbore B remains a set distance away from wellbore A and the wellbores remain substantially parallel. In certain embodiments the drilling of wellbore B is continuously adjusted based on continuous position assessments made by sensors . Data from drilling string for example orientation attitude and or gravitational data may be combined or synchronized with data from sensors to continuously assess the relative positions of the wellbores and adjust the drilling of wellbore B accordingly. Continuously assessing the relative positions of the wellbores may allow for coiled tubing drilling of wellbore B.

In some embodiments drilling string may include two or more sensing arrays . Sensing arrays may include two or more sensors . Using two or more sensing arrays in drilling string may allow for the direct measurement of magnetic interference of magnets on the measurement of the Earth s magnetic field. Directly measuring any magnetic interference of magnets on the measurement of the Earth s magnetic field may reduce errors in readings for example error to pointing azimuth . The direct measurement of the field gradient from the magnets from within drill string also provides confirmation of reference field strength of the field to be measured from within wellbore A.

The electromagnetic field provided by the voltage signal may be sensed by sensor . The sensed signal may be used to assess a position of wellbore B relative to wellbore A.

In some embodiments wire is a ranging wire located in wellbore A. In some embodiments the voltage signal is provided by an electrical conductor that will be used as part of a heater in wellbore A. In some embodiments the voltage signal is provided by an electrical conductor that is part of a heater or production equipment located in wellbore A. Wire or other electrical conductors used to provide the voltage signal may be grounded so that there is no current return along the wire or in the wellbore. Return current may cancel the electromagnetic field produced by the wire.

Where return current exists the current may be measured and modeled to generate a net current from which a voltage signal may be resolved. For example in some areas a 600 A signal current may only yield a 3 6 A net current. Where it is not feasible to eliminate sufficient return current along the wellbore containing the conductor in some embodiments two conductors may be installed in separate wellbores. In this method signal wires from each of the existing wellbores are connected to opposite voltage terminals of the signal generator. The return current path is in this way guided through the earth from the contactor region of one conductor to the other.

In certain embodiments the reference voltage signal is turned on and off pulsed so that multiple measurements are taken by sensor over a selected time period. The multiple measurements may be averaged to reduce or eliminate resolution error in sensing the reference voltage signal. In some embodiments providing the reference voltage signal sensing the signal and adjusting the drilling based on the sensed signals are performed continuously without providing any data to the surface or any surface operator input to the downhole equipment. For example an automated system located downhole may be used to perform all the downhole sensing and adjustment operations.

The signal field generated by the net current passing through the conductors needs to be resolved from the general background field existing when the signal field is off . A method for resolving the signal field from the general background field on a continuous basis may include 1. calculating background components based on the known attitude of the sensors and the known value background field strength and dip 2. a synchronized null function to be applied immediately before the reference field is switched on and or 3. synchronized sampling of forward and reversed DC polarities the subtraction of these sampled values may effectively remove the background field yielding the reference total current field .

The signal provided by source may be sensed by sensor . The sensed signal may be used to assess a position of wellbore B relative to wellbore A. In certain embodiments the signal is continuously sensed using sensor . The continuously sensed signal may be used to continuously and or automatically adjust the drilling of wellbore B. The continuous sensing of the electromagnetic signal may be dual directional creating a data link between transceivers. The antenna sensor may be directly connected to a surface interface allowing a data link between surface and subsurface to be established.

In some embodiments source and or sensor are sources and sensors used in a walkover radio locater system. Walkover radio locater systems are for example used in telecommunications to locate underground lines. In some embodiments the walkover radio located system components may be modified to be located in wellbore A and wellbore B so that the relative positions of the wellbores are assessable using the walkover radio located system components.

In certain embodiments multiple sources and multiple sensors may be used to assess and adjust the drilling of one or more wellbores. depicts an embodiment for assessing a position of a plurality of first wellbores relative to a plurality of second wellbores using radio ranging signals. Sources may be located in a plurality of wellbores A. Sensors may be located in one or more wellbores B. In some embodiments sources are located in wellbores B and sensors are located in wellbores A.

In one embodiment wellbores A are drilled substantially vertically in the formation and wellbores B are drilled substantially horizontally in the formation. Thus wellbores B are substantially perpendicular relative to wellbores A. Sensors in wellbores B may detect signals from one or more of sources . Detecting signals from more than one source may allow for more accurate measurement of the relative positions of the wellbores in the formation. In some embodiments electromagnetic attenuation and phase shift detected from multiple sources is used to define the position of a sensor and the wellbore . The paths of the electromagnetic radio waves may be predicted to allow detection and use of the electromagnetic attenuation and the phase shift to define the sensor position.

Resulting electromagnetic field is measured by sensor for example a transceiving antenna in bottom hole assembly A of first wellbore A being drilled in proximity to the location of heater . A predetermined known net current in the formation may be relied upon to provide a reference magnetic field.

The injection of the reference current may be rapidly pulsed and synchronized with the receiving antenna and or sensor data. Access to a high data rate signal from the magnetometers can be used to filter the effects of sensor movement during drilling. The measurement of the reference magnetic field may provide a distance and direction to the heater. Averaging many of these results will provide the position of the actively drilled hole. The known position of the heater and known depth of the active sensors may be used to assess position coordinates of easting northing and elevation.

The quality of data generated with such a method may depend on the accuracy of the net current prediction along the length of the heater. Using formation resistivity data a model may be used to predict the losses to earth along the bottom hole assembly. The bottom hole assembly may be in direct contact with the formation and borehole fluids.

The current may be measured on both the element and the bottom hole assembly at the surface. The difference in values is the overall current loss to the formation. It is anticipated that the net field strength will vary along the length of the heater. The field is expected to be greater at the surface when the positive voltage applies to the bottom hole assembly.

If there are minimal losses to earth in the formation the net field may not be strong enough to provide a useful detection range. In some embodiments a net current in the range of about 2 A to about 50 A about 5 A to about 40 A or about 10 A to about 30 A may be employed.

In some embodiments two heaters are used as a long conductor for a reference current pulsed DC or AC to be injected for assessing a position of a first wellbore relative to a second wellbore. Utilizing two separate heater elements may result in relatively better control of return current path and therefore better control of reference current strength.

A two heater method may not rely on the accuracy of a model of current loss to formation as current is contained in the heater element along the full length of the heaters. Current may be rapidly pulsed and synchronized with the transceiving antenna and or sensor data to resolve distance and direction to the heater. depict an embodiment for assessing a position of first wellbore A relative to second wellbore B using two heater assemblies A and B as current conductors. Resulting electromagnetic field is measured by sensor for example a transceiving antenna in bottom hole assembly A of first wellbore A being drilled in proximity to the location of heaters A and A in second wellbore B.

In some embodiments parallel well tracking may be used for assessing a position of a first wellbore relative to a second wellbore. Parallel well tracking may utilize magnets of a known strength and a known length positioned in the pre drilled second wellbore. Magnetic sensors positioned in the active first wellbore may be used to measure the field from the magnets in the second wellbore. Measuring the generated magnetic field in the second wellbore with sensors in the first wellbore may assess distance and direction of the active first wellbore. In some embodiments magnets positioned in the second wellbore may be carefully positioned and multiple static measurements taken to resolve any general background magnetic field. Background magnetic fields may be resolved through use of a null function before positioning the magnets in the second wellbore calculating background components from known sensor attitudes and or a gradiometer setup.

In some embodiments reference magnets may be positioned in the drilling bottom hole assembly of the first wellbore. Sensors may be positioned in the passive second wellbore. The prepositioned sensors may be nulled prior to the arrival of the magnets in the detectable range to eliminate Earth s background field. This may significantly reduce the time required to assess the position and direction of the first wellbore during drilling as the bottom hole assembly continues drilling with no stoppages. The commercial availability of low cost sensors such as a terrella utilizing magnetoresistives rather than fluxgates may be incorporated into the wall of a deployment coil at useful separations.

In some embodiments multiple types of sources may be used in combination with two or more sensors to assess and adjust the drilling of one or more wellbores. A method of assessing a position of a first wellbore relative to a second wellbore may include a combination of angle sensors telemetry and or ranging systems. Such a method may be referred to as umbilical position control.

Angle sensors may assess an attitude azimuth inclination and roll of a bottom hole assembly. Assessing the attitude of a bottom hole assembly may include measuring for example azimuth inclination and or roll. Telemetry may transmit data for example measurements between the surface and for example sensors positioned in a wellbore. Ranging may assess the position of a bottom hole assembly in a first wellbore relative to a second wellbore. The second wellbore in some embodiments may include an existing previously drilled wellbore.

In first wellbore A sensor A may be coupled to first transceiving antenna A. First transceiving antenna A may communicate with second transceiving antenna B in second wellbore B. The first transceiving antenna may be positioned on bottom hole assembly . Sensors coupled to the first transceiving antenna may include for example magnetometers and or accelerometers. In certain embodiments sensors coupled to the first transceiving antenna may include dual magnetometer accelerometer sets.

To accomplish data transfer first transceiving antenna A transmits short hops measured data through the ground to second transceiving antenna B located in the second wellbore. The data may then be transmitted to the surface via embedded wires in the deployment tubular.

Two redundant ranging systems may be utilized for umbilical control systems. A first ranging system may include a version of a plasma wave tracker PWT . depicts an embodiment of umbilical positioning control system employing a magnetic gradiometer system. A PWT may include a pair of sensors B for example magnetometer accelerometer sets embedded in the wall of second wellbore deployment coil the umbilical . These sensors act as a magnetic gradiometer to detect the magnetic field from reference magnet installed in bottom hole assembly of first wellbore A. In a horizontal section of the second wellbore a relative position of the umbilical to the first wellbore reference magnet s may be determined by the gradient. Data may be sent to the surface through fiber optic cables or wires .

A second ranging system may be based on using the signal strength and phase of the through the earth wireless link for example radio established between first transceiving antenna A in first wellbore A and second transceiving antenna B in second wellbore B. Sensor A may be coupled to first transceiving antenna A. Given the close spacing of wellbores A B and the variability in electrical properties of the formation the attenuation rates for the electromagnetic signal may be predictable. Predictable attenuation rates for the electromagnetic signal allow the signal strength to be used as a measure of separation between first and second transceiver pairs A B. The vector direction of the magnetic field induced by the electromagnetic transmissions from the first wellbore may provide the direction. A transceiver may communicate with the surface via wire or fiber optics for example wire coupled to the transceiver.

With a known resistivity of the formation and operating frequency the distance between the source and point of measurement may be calculated. depicts two examples of the relationship between power received and distance based upon two different formations with different resistivities and . If 10 W is transmitted at a 12 Hz frequency in 20 ohm m formation the power received amounts to approximately 9.10 W at 30 m distance. The resistivity was chosen at random and may vary depending on where you are in the ground. If a higher resistivity was chosen at the given frequency such as 100 ohm m formation a lower attenuation is observed and a low characterization occurs whereupon it receives 9.58 W at 30 m distance. Thus high resistivity although transmitting power desirably shows a negative affect in electromagnetic ranging possibilities. Since the main influence in attenuation is the distance itself calculations may be made solving for the distance between a source and a point of measurement.

The frequency the electromagnetic source operates on is another factor that affects attenuation. Typically the higher the frequency the higher the attenuation and vice versa. A strategy for choosing between various frequencies may depend on the formation chosen. For example while the attenuation at a resistivity of 100 ohm m may be good for data communications it may not be sufficient for distance calculations. Thus a higher frequency may be chosen to increase attenuation. Alternatively a lower frequency may be chosen for the opposite purpose.

Wireless data communications in ground may allow an opportunity for electromagnetic ranging and the variable frequency it operates on must be observed to balance out benefits for both functionalities. Benefits of wireless data communication may include but are not be limited to 1 automatic depth sync through the use of ranging and telemetry 2 fast communications with dedicated hardwired for example optic fiber coil for a transceiving antenna running in for example the second wellbore 3 functioning as an alternative method for fast communication when hardwire in for example the first wellbore is not available 4 functioning in under balanced and over balanced drilling 5 providing a similar method for transmitting control commands to a bottom hole assembly 6 sensors are reusable reducing costs and waste 7 decreasing noise measurement functions split between the first wellbore and the second wellbore and or 8 multiple position measurement techniques simultaneously supported may provide real time best estimate of position and attitude.

In some embodiments it may be advisable to employ sensors able to compensate for magnetic fields produced internally by carbon steel casing built in the vertical section of a reference hole for example high range magnetometers . In some embodiments modification may be made to account for problems with wireless antenna communications between wellbores penetrating through wellbore casings.

Increasing the density and quality of directional data during drilling may increase the accuracy and efficiency in forming wellbores in subsurface formations. The quality of directional data may be diminished by vibrations and angular accelerations during rotary drilling especially during rotary drilling segments of wellbore formation using slide mode drilling.

In certain embodiments the quality of the data assessed during rotary drilling is increased by installing directional sensors in a non rotating housing. depicts an embodiment of drilling string with non rotating sensor . In certain embodiments non rotating sensor is located behind motor . Motor may be a steerable motor. Motor may be located behind drill bit . In certain embodiments sensor is located between non magnetic components in drilling string . In some embodiments non rotating sensor is located in a sleeve over motor . In some embodiments non rotating sensor is run on any bottom hole assembly BHA for improved data assessment.

In certain embodiments non rotating sensor includes one or more transceivers for communicating data either into drilling string within the BHA or to similar transceivers in nearby boreholes. The transceivers may be used for telemetry of data and or as a means of position assessment or verification. In certain embodiments use of non rotating sensor allows continuous position measurement. Continuous position measurement may be useful in control systems used for drilling position systems and or umbilical position control.

Pieces of formation or rock may protrude or fall into the wellbore due to various failures including rock breakage or plastic deformation during and or after wellbore formation. Protrusions may interfere with drill string movement and or the flow of drilling fluids. Protrusions may prevent running tubulars into the wellbore after the drill string has been removed from the wellbore. Significant amounts of material entering or protruding into the wellbore may cause wellbore integrity failure and or lead to the drill string becoming stuck in the wellbore. Some causes of wellbore integrity failure may be in situ stresses and high pore pressures. Mud weight may be increased to hold back the formation and inhibit wellbore integrity failure during wellbore formation. When increasing the mud weight is not practical the wellbore may be reamed.

Reaming the wellbore may be accomplished by moving the drill string up and down one joint while rotating and circulating. Picking the drill string up can be difficult because of material protruding into the borehole above the bit or BHA bottom hole assembly . Picking up the drill string may be facilitated by placing upward facing cutting structures on the drill bit. Without upward facing cutting structures on the drill bit the rock protruding into the borehole above the drill bit must be broken by grinding or crushing rather than by cutting. Grinding or crushing may induce additional wellbore failure.

Moving the drill string up and down may induce surging or pressure pulses that contribute to wellbore failure. Pressure surging or fluctuations may be aggravated or made worse by blockage of normal drilling fluid flow by protrusions into the wellbore. Thus attempts to clear the borehole of debris may cause even more debris to enter the wellbore.

When the wellbore fails further up the drill string than one joint from the drill bit the drill string must be raised more than one joint. Lifting more than one joint in length may require that joints be removed from the drill string during lifting and placed back on the drill string when lowered. Removing and adding joints requires additional time and labor and increases the risk of surging as circulation is stopped and started for each joint connection.

In some embodiments cutting structures may be positioned at various points along the drill string. Cutting structures may be positioned on the drill string at selected locations for example where the diameter of the drill string or BHA changes. and depict cutting structures located at or near diameter changes in drill string near to drill bit and or BHA . As depicted in cutting structures may be positioned at selected locations along the length of BHA and or drill string that has a substantially uniform diameter. Cutting structures may remove formation that extends into the wellbore as the drilling string is rotated. Cuttings formed by the cutting structures may be removed from the wellbore by the normal circulation used during the formation of the wellbore.

In some embodiments some cutting structures may be upwardly facing some cutting structures may be downwardly facing and or some cutting structures may be oriented substantially perpendicular to the drill string. depicts an embodiment of a portion of drilling string including upward facing cutting structures downward facing cutting structures and cutting structures that are substantially perpendicular to the drill string. Cutting structures may remove protrusions extending into wellbore that would inhibit upward movement of drill string . Cutting structures may facilitate reaming of wellbore and or removal of drill string from the wellbore for drill bit change BHA maintenance and or when total depth has been reached. Cutting structures may remove protrusions extending into wellbore that would inhibit downward movement of drill string . Cutting structures may ensure that enlarged diameter portions of drill string do not become stuck in wellbore .

Positioning downward facing cutting structures at various locations along a length of the drill string may allow for reaming of the wellbore while the drill bit forms additional borehole at the bottom of the wellbore. The ability to ream while drilling may avoid pressure surges in the wellbore caused by lifting the drill string. Reaming while drilling allows the wellbore to be reamed without interrupting normal drilling operation. Reaming while drilling allows the wellbore to be formed in less time because a separate reaming operation is avoided. Upward facing cutting structures allow for easy removal of the drill string from the wellbore.

In some embodiments the drill string includes a plurality of cutting structures positioned along the length of the drill string but not necessarily along the entire length of the drill string. The cutting structures may be positioned at regular or irregular intervals along the length of the drill string. Positioning cutting structures along the length of the drill string allows the entire wellbore to be reamed without the need to remove the entire drill string from the wellbore.

Cutting structures may be coupled or attached to the drill string using techniques known in the art for example by welding . In some embodiments cutting structures are formed as part of a hinged ring or multi piece ring that may be bolted welded or otherwise attached to the drill string. In some embodiments the distance that the cutting structures extend beyond the drill string may be adjustable. For example the cutting element of the cutting structure may include threading and a locking ring that allows for positioning and setting of the cutting element.

In some wellbores a wash over or over coring operation may be needed to free or recover an object in the wellbore that is stuck in the wellbore due to caving closing or squeezing of the formation around the object. The object may be a canister tool drill string or other item. A wash over pipe with downward facing cutting structures at the bottom of the pipe may be used. The wash over pipe may also include upward facing cutting structures and downward facing cutting structures at locations near the end of the wash over pipe. The additional upward facing cutting structures and downward facing cutting structures may facilitate freeing and or recovery of the object stuck in the wellbore. The formation holding the object may be cut away rather than broken by relying on hydraulics and force to break the portion of the formation holding the stuck object.

A problem in some formations is that the formed borehole begins to close soon after the drill string is removed from the borehole. Boreholes which close up soon after being formed make it difficult to insert objects such as tubulars canisters tools or other equipment into the wellbore. In some embodiments reaming while drilling applied to the core drill string allows for emplacement of the objects in the center of the core drill pipe. The core drill pipe includes one or more upward facing cutting structures in addition to cutting structures located at the end of the core drill pipe. The core drill pipe may be used to form the wellbore for the object to be inserted in the formation. The object may be positioned in the core of the core drill pipe. Then the core drill pipe may be removed from the formation. Any parts of the formation that may inhibit removal of the core drill pipe are cut by the upward facing cutting structures as the core drill pipe is removed from the formation.

Replacement canisters may be positioned in the formation using over core drill pipe. First the existing canister to be replaced is over cored. The existing canister is then pulled from within the core drill pipe without removing the core drill pipe from the borehole. The replacement canister is then run inside of the core drill pipe. Then the core drill pipe is removed from the borehole. Upward facing cutting structures positioned along the length of the core drill pipe cut portions of the formation that may inhibit removal of the core drill pipe.

During some in situ heat treatment processes wellbores may need to be formed in heated formations. Wellbores drilled into hot formation may be additional or replacement heater wells additional or replacement production wells and or monitor wells. Cooling while drilling may enhance wellbore stability safety and longevity of drilling tools. When the drilling fluid is liquid significant wellbore cooling can occur due to the circulation of the drilling fluid.

In some in situ heat treatment processes a barrier formed around all or a portion of the in situ heat treatment process is formed by freeze wells that form a low temperature zone around the freeze wells. A portion of the cooling capacity of the freeze well equipment may be utilized to cool the equipment needed to drill into the hot formation. Drilling bits may be advanced slowly in hot sections to ensure that the formed wellbore cools sufficiently to preclude drilling problems.

When using conventional circulation drilling fluid flows down the inside of the drilling string and back up the outside of the drilling string. Other circulation systems such as reverse circulation may also be used. In some embodiments the drill pipe may be positioned in a pipe in pipe configuration.

Drilling string used to form the wellbore may function as a counter flow heat exchanger. The deeper the well the more the drilling fluid heats up on the way down to the drill bit as the drilling string passes through heated portions of the formation. Thus the counter flow heat exchanger effect reduces downhole cooling. When normal circulation does not deliver low enough temperature drilling fluid to the drill bit to provide adequate cooling two options have been employed to enhance cooling. Mud coolers on the surface can be used to reduce the inlet temperature of the drilling fluid being pumped downhole. If cooling is still inadequate insulated drilling string can be used to reduce the counter flow heat exchanger effect.

In some embodiments all or a portion of conduit may be insulated to reduce heat transfer to the cooled mud as the mud passes into the formation. Insulating all or a portion of conduit may allow colder mud to be provided to the drill bit than if the conduit is not insulated. Conduit may be insulated for greater than of the length of the conduit for greater than the length of the conduit for greater than the length of the conduit or for substantially all of the length of the conduit.

All or a portion of inlet leg may be insulated to inhibit heat transfer to the cooling fluid entering closed loop system from cooling fluid leaving the closing loop system through exit leg and or with the drilling mud. Insulating all or a portion of inlet leg may also maintain the cooling fluid at a low temperature so that the cooling fluid is able to absorb heat from the drilling mud in a region near drill bit so that the drilling mud is able to cool the drill bit and or the formation. In some embodiments all or a portion of inlet leg is made of a material with low thermal conductivity to limit heat transfer to the cooling fluid in the inlet leg. For example all or a portion of inlet leg may be made of a polyethylene pipe.

In some embodiments inlet leg and the exit leg for the cooling fluid are arranged in a conduit in conduit configuration. In one embodiment cooling fluid flows down the inner conduit the inlet leg and returns through the space between the inner conduit and the outer conduit the exit leg . The inner conduit may be insulated or made of a material with low thermal conductivity to inhibit or reduce heat transfer between the cooling fluid going down the inner conduit and the cooling fluid returning through the space between the inner conduit and the outer conduit. In some embodiments the inner conduit may be made of a polymer such as high density polyethylene.

For various reasons including lost circulation wells are frequently drilled with gas for example air nitrogen carbon dioxide methane ethane and other light hydrocarbon gases as the drilling fluid primarily to maintain a low equivalent circulating density low downhole pressure gradient . Gas has low potential for cooling the wellbore because mass flow rates of gas drilling are much lower than when liquid drilling fluid is used. Also gas has a low heat capacity compared to liquid. As a result of heat flow from the outside to the inside of the drilling string the gas arrives at the drill bit at close to formation temperature. Controlling the inlet temperature of the gas analogous to using mud coolers when drilling with liquid or using insulated drilling string only marginally reduces the counter flow heat exchanger effect when gas drilling. Some gases are more effective than others at transferring heat but the use of gasses with better heat transfer properties does not significantly improve wellbore cooling while gas drilling.

Gas drilling may deliver the drilling fluid to the drill bit at close to the formation temperature. The gas may have little capacity to absorb heat. A defining feature of gas drilling is the low density column in the annulus. Immaterial to the benefits of gas drilling is the phase of the drilling fluid flowing down the inside of the drilling pipe. Thus the benefits of gas drilling can be accomplished if the drilling fluid is liquid while flowing down the drilling string and gas while flowing back up the annulus. The heat of vaporization is used to cool the drill bit and the formation rather than the sensible heat of the drilling fluid.

An advantage of this approach is that even though the liquid arrives at the bit at close to formation temperature it can absorb heat by vaporizing. In fact the heat of vaporization is typically larger than the heat that can be absorbed by a temperature rise. As a comparison consider drilling a 7 wellbore with 3 drilling string circulating low density mud at about 203 gpm and with about a 100 ft min typical annular velocity. Drilling through a 450 F. zone at 1000 feet will result in a mud exit temperature about 8 F. hotter than the inlet temperature. This results in the removal of about 14 000 Btu min. The removal of this much heat lowers the bit temperature from about 450 F. to about 285 F. If liquid water is injected down the drilling string and allowed to boil at the bit and steam is produced up the annulus the mass flow required to remove cuttings is about 34 lbm min assuming the back pressure is about 100 psia. At 34 lbm min the heat removed from the wellbore would be about 34 lbm min 1187 180 Btu lbm or about 34 000 Btu min. This heat removal amount is about 2.4 times the liquid cooling case. Thus at reasonable annular steam flow rates a significant amount of heat can be removed by vaporization.

The high velocities required for gas drilling are achieved by the expansion that occurs during vaporization rather than by employing compressors on the surface. Eliminating the need for compressors may simplify the drilling process eliminate the cost of the compressor and eliminate a source of heat applied to the drilling fluid on the way to the drill bit.

Critical to the process of delivering liquid to the drill bit is preventing boiling within the drilling string. If the drilling fluid flowing downwards boils before reaching the drill bit the heat of vaporization is used to extract heat from the drilling fluid flowing up the annulus. The heat transferred from the annulus outside the drilling string to inside the drilling string boiling the fluid is heat that is not rejected from the well when drilling fluid reaches the surface. Boiling that occurs inside of the drilling string before the drilling fluid reaches the bottom of the hole is not beneficial to drill bit and or wellbore cooling.

If the pressure in the drilling string is maintained above the boiling pressure for a given temperature by use of a back pressure device then the transfer of heat from outside the drilling string to inside can be minimized or essentially eliminated. The liquid supplied to the drill bit may be vaporized. Vaporization may result in the drilling fluid adsorbing the heat of vaporization from the drill bit and formation. For example if the back pressure device is set to allow flow only when the back pressure is above 250 psi the fluid within the drilling string will not boil unless the temperature is above 400 F. If the temperature of the formation is above this for example 500 F. steps may be taken to inhibit boiling of the fluid on the way down to the drill bit. In an embodiment the back pressure device is set to maintain a back pressure that inhibits boiling of the drilling fluid at the temperature of the formation for example 580 psi to inhibit boiling up to a temperature of 500 F. . In another embodiment the drilling pipe is insulated and or the drilling fluid is cooled so that the back pressure device is able to maintain the drilling fluid that reaches the drill bit as a liquid.

Two back pressure devices that may be used to maintain elevated pressure within the drilling string are a choke and a pressure activated valve. Other types of back pressure devices may also be used. Chokes have a restriction in flow area that creates back pressure by resisting flow. Resisting the flow results in increased upstream pressure to force the fluid through the restriction. Pressure activated valves do not open until a minimum upstream pressure is obtained. The pressure difference across a pressure activated valves may determine if the pressure activated valve is open to allow flow or closed.

In some embodiments both a choke and pressure activated valve may be used. A choke can be the bit nozzles allowing the liquid to be jetted toward the drill bit and the bottom of the hole. The bit nozzles may enhance drill bit cleaning and help prevent fouling of the drill bit and pressure activated valve. Fouling may occur if boiling in the drill bit or pressure activated valve caused solids to precipitate. The pressure activated valve may prevent premature boiling at low flow rates below flow rates at which the chokes are effective.

Additives may be added to the drilling fluid. The additives may modify the properties of the fluids in the liquid phase and or the gas phase. Additives may include but are not limited to surfactants to foam the fluid additives to chemically alter the interaction of the fluid with the formations for example to stabilize the formation additives to control corrosion and additives for other benefits.

In some embodiments a non condensable gas may be added to the drilling fluid pumped down the drilling string. The non condensable gas may be but is not limited to nitrogen carbon dioxide air and mixtures thereof. Adding the non condensable gas results in pumping a two phase mixture down the drilling string. One reason for adding the non condensable gas is to enhance the flow of the fluid out of the formation. The presence of the non condensable gas may inhibit condensation of the vaporized drilling fluid and help to carry cuttings out of the formation. In some embodiments one or more heaters may be present at one or more locations in the wellbore to provide heat that inhibits condensation and reflux of drilling fluid leaving the formation.

Managed pressure drilling and or managed volumetric drilling may be used during formation of wellbores. The back pressure on the wellbore may be held to a prescribed value to control the down hole pressure. Similarly the volume of fluid entering and exiting the well may be balanced so that there is no net influx or out flux of drilling fluid into the formation.

In some embodiments one piece of equipment may be used to drill multiple wellbores in a single day. The wellbores may be formed at penetration rates that are many times faster than the penetration rates using conventional drilling with drilling bits. The high penetration rate allows separate equipment to accomplish drilling and casing operations in a more efficient manner than using a one trip approach. The high penetration rate requires accurate real time directional drilling in three dimensions.

In some embodiments high penetration rates may be attained using composite coiled tubing in combination with particle jet drilling. Particle jet drilling forms an opening in a formation by impacting the formation with high pressure fluid containing particles to remove material from the formation. The particles may function as abrasives. In addition to composite coiled tubing and particle jet drilling a downhole electric orienter bubble entrained mud downhole inertial navigation and a computer control system may be needed. Other types of drilling fluid and drilling fluid systems may be used instead of using bubble entrained mud. Such drilling fluid systems may include but are not limited to straight liquid circulation systems multiphase circulation systems using liquid and gas and or foam circulation systems.

Composite coiled tubing has a fatigue life that is significantly greater than the fatigue life of coiled steel tubing. Composite coiled tubing is available from Airborne Composites BV The Hague The Netherlands . Composite coiled tubing can be used to form many boreholes in a formation. The composite coiled tubing may include integral power lines for providing electricity to downhole tools. The composite coiled tubing may include integral data lines for providing real time information regarding downhole conditions to the computer control system and for sending real time control information from the computer control system to the downhole equipment.

The coiled tubing may include an abrasion resistant outer sheath. The outer sheath may inhibit damage to the coiled tubing due to sliding experienced by the coiled tubing during deployment and retrieval. In some embodiments the coiled tubing may be rotated during use in lieu of or in addition to having an abrasion resistant outer sheath to minimize uneven wear of the composite coiled tubing.

Particle jet drilling may advantageously allow for stepped changes in the drilling rate. Drill bits are no longer needed and downhole motors are eliminated. Particle jet drilling may decouple cutting formation to form the borehole from the bottom hole assembly. Decoupling cutting formation to form the borehole from the bottom hole assembly reduces the impact that variable formation properties for example formation dip vugs fractures and transition zones have on wellbore trajectory. By decoupling cutting formation to form the borehole from the bottom hole assembly directional drilling may be reduced to orienting one or more particle jet nozzles in appropriate directions. Additionally particle jet drilling may be used to under ream one or more portions of a wellbore to form a larger diameter opening.

Particles may be introduced into a high pressure injection stream during particle jet drilling. The ability to achieve and circulate high particle laden fluid under high pressure may facilitate the successful use of particle jet drilling. One type of pump that may be used for particle jet drilling is a heavy duty piston membrane pump. Heavy duty piston membrane pumps may be available from ABEL GmbH Co. KG Buchen Germany . Piston membrane pumps have been used for long term continuous pumping of slurries containing high total solids in the mining and power industries. Piston membrane pumps are similar to triplex pumps used for drilling operations in the oil and gas industry except heavy duty preformed membranes separate the slurry from the hydraulic side of the pump. In this fashion the solids laden fluid is brought up to pressure in the injection line in one step and circulated downhole without damaging the internal mechanisms of the pump.

Another type of pump that may be used for particle jet drilling is an annular pressure exchange pump. Annular pressure exchange pumps may be available from Macmahon Mining Services Pty Ltd Lonsdale Australia . Annular pressure exchange pumps have been used for long term continuous pumping of slurries containing high total solids in the mining industry. Annular pressure exchange pumps use hydraulic oil to compress a hose inside a high strength pressure chamber in a peristaltic like way to displace the contents of the hose. Annular pressure exchange pumps may obtain continuous flow by having twin chambers. One chamber fills while the other chamber is purged.

The bottom hole assembly may include a downhole electric orienter. The downhole electric orienter may allow for directional drilling by directing one or more particle jet drilling nozzles in desired directions. The downhole electric orienter may be coupled to a computer control system through one or more integral data lines of the composite coiled tubing. Power for the downhole electric orienter may be supplied through an integral power line of the composite coiled tubing or through a battery system in the bottom hole assembly.

Bubble entrained mud may be used as the drilling fluid. Bubble entrained mud may allow for particle jet drilling without raising the equivalent circulating density to unacceptable levels. A form of managed pressure drilling may be affected by varying the density of bubble entrainment. In some embodiments particles in the drilling fluid may be separated from the drilling fluid using magnetic recovery when the particles include iron or alloys that may be influenced by magnetic fields. Bubble entrained mud may be used because using air or other gas as the drilling fluid may result in excessive wear of components from high velocity particles in the return stream. The density of the bubble entrained mud going downhole as a function of real time gains and losses of fluid may be automated using the computer control system.

In some embodiments multiphase systems are used. For example if gas injection rates are low enough that wear rates are acceptable a gas liquid circulating system may be used. Bottom hole circulating pressures may be adjusted by the computer control system. The computer control system may adjust the gas and or liquid injection rates.

In some embodiments pipe in pipe drilling is used. Pipe in pipe drilling may include circulating fluid through the space between the outer pipe and the inner pipe instead of between the wellbore and the drill string. Pipe in pipe drilling may be used if contact of the drilling fluid with one or more fresh water aquifers is not acceptable. Pipe in pipe drilling may be used if the density of the drilling fluid cannot be adjusted low enough to effectively reduce potential lost circulation issues.

Downhole inertial navigation may be part of the bottom hole assembly. The use of downhole inertial navigation allows for determination of the position including depth azimuth and inclination without magnetic sensors. Magnetic interference from casings and or emissions from the high density of wells in the formation may interfere with a system that determines the position of the bottom hole assembly based on magnet sensors.

The computer control system may receive information from the bottom hole assembly. The computer control system may process the information to determine the position of the bottom hole assembly. The computer control system may control drilling fluid rate drilling fluid density drilling fluid pressure particle density other variables and or the downhole electric orienter to control the rate of penetration and or the direction of borehole formation.

In some embodiments robots are used to perform a task in a wellbore formed or being formed using composite coiled tubing. The task may be but is not limited to providing traction to move the coiled tubing surveying removing cuttings logging and or freeing pipe. For example a robot may be used when drilling a horizontal opening if enough weight cannot be applied to the bottom hole assembly to advance the coiled tubing and bottom hole assembly in the formed borehole. The robot may be sent down the borehole. The robot may clamp to the composite coiled tubing. Portions of the robot may extend to engage the formation. Traction between the robot and the formation may be used to advance the robot forward so that the composite coiled tubing and the bottom hole assembly advance forward.

The robots may be battery powered. To use the robot drilling could be stopped and the robot could be connected to the outside of the composite coiled tubing. The robot would run along the outside of the composite coiled tubing to the bottom of the hole. If needed the robot could electrically couple to the bottom hole assembly. The robot could couple to a contact plate on the bottom hole assembly. The bottom hole assembly may include a step down transformer that brings the high voltage low current electricity supplied to the bottom hole assembly to a lower voltage and higher current for example one third the voltage and three times the amperage supplied to the bottom hole assembly . The lower voltage higher current electricity supplied from the step down transformer may be used to recharge the batteries of the robot. In some embodiments the robot may function while coupled to the bottom hole assembly. The batteries may supply sufficient energy for the robot to travel to the drill bit and back to the surface.

Some wellbores formed in the formation may be used to facilitate formation of a perimeter barrier around a treatment area. Heat sources in the treatment area may heat hydrocarbons in the formation within the treatment area. The perimeter barrier may be but is not limited to a low temperature or frozen barrier formed by freeze wells a wax barrier formed in the formation dewatering wells a grout wall formed in the formation a sulfur cement barrier a barrier formed by a gel produced in the formation a barrier formed by precipitation of salts in the formation a barrier formed by a polymerization reaction in the formation and or sheets driven into the formation. Heat sources production wells injection wells dewatering wells and or monitoring wells may be installed in the treatment area defined by the barrier prior to simultaneously with or after installation of the barrier.

A low temperature zone around at least a portion of a treatment area may be formed by freeze wells. In an embodiment refrigerant is circulated through freeze wells to form low temperature zones around each freeze well. The freeze wells are placed in the formation so that the low temperature zones overlap and form a low temperature zone around the treatment area. The low temperature zone established by freeze wells is maintained below the freezing temperature of aqueous fluid in the formation. Aqueous fluid entering the low temperature zone freezes and forms the frozen barrier. In other embodiments the freeze barrier is formed by batch operated freeze wells. A cold fluid such as liquid nitrogen is introduced into the freeze wells to form low temperature zones around the freeze wells. The fluid is replenished as needed.

In some embodiments two or more rows of freeze wells are located about all or a portion of the perimeter of the treatment area to form a thick interconnected low temperature zone. Thick low temperature zones may be formed adjacent to areas in the formation where there is a high flow rate of aqueous fluid in the formation. The thick barrier may ensure that breakthrough of the frozen barrier established by the freeze wells does not occur.

In some embodiments a double barrier system is used to isolate a treatment area. The double barrier system may be formed with a first barrier and a second barrier. The first barrier may be formed around at least a portion of the treatment area to inhibit fluid from entering or exiting the treatment area. The second barrier may be formed around at least a portion of the first barrier to isolate an inter barrier zone between the first barrier and the second barrier. The inter barrier zone may have a thickness from about 1 m to about 300 m. In some embodiments the thickness of the inter barrier zone is from about 10 m to about 100 m or from about 20 m to about 50 m.

The double barrier system may allow greater project depths than a single barrier system. Greater depths are possible with the double barrier system because the stepped differential pressures across the first barrier and the second barrier is less than the differential pressure across a single barrier. The smaller differential pressures across the first barrier and the second barrier make a breach of the double barrier system less likely to occur at depth for the double barrier system as compared to the single barrier system.

The first barrier and the second barrier may be the same type of barrier or different types of barriers. In some embodiments the first barrier and the second barrier are formed by freeze wells. In some embodiments the first barrier is formed by freeze wells and the second barrier is a grout wall. The grout wall may be formed of cement sulfur sulfur cement or combinations thereof. In some embodiments a portion of the first barrier and or a portion of the second barrier is a natural barrier such as an impermeable rock formation.

Vertically positioned freeze wells and or horizontally positioned freeze wells may be positioned around sides of the treatment area. If the upper layer the overburden or the lower layer the underburden of the formation is likely to allow fluid flow into the treatment area or out of the treatment area horizontally positioned freeze wells may be used to form an upper and or a lower barrier for the treatment area. In some embodiments an upper barrier and or a lower barrier may not be necessary if the upper layer and or the lower layer are at least substantially impermeable. If the upper freeze barrier is formed portions of heat sources production wells injection wells and or dewatering wells that pass through the low temperature zone created by the freeze wells forming the upper freeze barrier wells may be insulated and or heat traced so that the low temperature zone does not adversely affect the functioning of the heat sources production wells injection wells and or dewatering wells passing through the low temperature zone.

Formation refrigerant may flow through cold side conduit from a refrigeration unit to inlet conduit of freeze well . The formation refrigerant may flow through an annular space between inlet conduit and canister to warm side conduit . Heat may transfer from the formation to canister and from the canister to the formation refrigerant in the annular space. Inlet conduit may be insulated to inhibit heat transfer to the formation refrigerant during passage of the formation refrigerant into freeze well . In an embodiment inlet conduit is a high density polyethylene tube. At cold temperatures some polymers may exhibit a large amount of thermal contraction. For example a 260 m initial length of polyethylene conduit subjected to a temperature of about 25 C. may contract by 6 m or more. If a high density polyethylene conduit or other polymer conduit is used the large thermal contraction of the material must be taken into account in determining the final depth of the freeze well. For example the freeze well may be drilled deeper than needed and the conduit may be allowed to shrink back during use. In some embodiments inlet conduit is an insulated metal tube. In some embodiments the insulation may be a polymer coating such as but not limited to polyvinylchloride high density polyethylene and or polystyrene.

Freeze well may be introduced into the formation using a coiled tubing rig. In an embodiment canister and inlet conduit are wound on a single reel. The coiled tubing rig introduces the canister and inlet conduit into the formation. In an embodiment canister is wound on a first reel and inlet conduit is wound on a second reel. The coiled tubing rig introduces canister into the formation. Then the coiled tubing rig is used to introduce inlet conduit into the canister. In other embodiments freeze well is assembled in sections at the wellbore site and introduced into the formation.

An insulated section of freeze well may be placed adjacent to overburden . An uninsulated section of freeze well may be placed adjacent to layer or layers where a low temperature zone is to be formed. In some embodiments uninsulated sections of the freeze wells may be positioned adjacent only to aquifers or other permeable portions of the formation that would allow fluid to flow into or out of the treatment area. Portions of the formation where uninsulated sections of the freeze wells are to be placed may be determined using analysis of cores and or logging techniques.

In some embodiments outer sleeve may include opening . Opening may align with a corresponding opening in inner sleeve . A shear pin may be positioned in the openings during insertion of inlet conduit in canister to inhibit movement of outer sleeve relative to inner sleeve . Shear pin is strong enough to support the weight of inner sleeve but weak enough to shear due to force applied to the shear pin when outer sleeve moves upwards in the wellbore due to thermal contraction or during installation of the inlet conduit after inlet conduit is coupled to canister .

Inner sleeve may be positioned in outer sleeve . Inner sleeve has a length sufficient to inhibit separation of the inner sleeve from outer sleeve when inlet conduit has fully contracted due to exposure of the inlet conduit to low temperature refrigerant. Inner sleeve may include a plurality of slip rings held in place by positioners a plurality of openings stop and latch . Slip rings may position inner sleeve relative to outer sleeve and allow the outer sleeve to move relative to the inner sleeve. In some embodiments slip rings are TEFLON rings such as polytetrafluoroethylene rings. Slip rings may be made of different material in other embodiments. Positioners may be steel rings welded to inner sleeve. Positioners may be thinner than slip rings . Positioners may inhibit movement of slip rings relative to inner sleeve .

Openings may be formed in a portion of inner sleeve near the bottom of the inner sleeve. Openings may allow refrigerant to pass from inlet conduit to canister .

Grout wax polymer or other material may be used in combination with freeze wells to provide a barrier for the in situ heat treatment process. The material may fill cavities vugs in the formation and reduces the permeability of the formation. The material may have higher thermal conductivity than gas and or formation fluid that fills cavities in the formation. Placing material in the cavities may allow for faster low temperature zone formation. The material may form a perpetual barrier in the formation that may strengthen the formation. The use of material to form the barrier in unconsolidated or substantially unconsolidated formation material may allow for larger well spacing than is possible without the use of the material. The combination of the material and the low temperature zone formed by freeze wells may constitute a double barrier for environmental regulation purposes. In some embodiments the material is introduced into the formation as a liquid and the liquid sets in the formation to form a solid. The material may be but is not limited to fine cement micro fine cement sulfur sulfur cement viscous thermoplastics and or waxes. The material may include surfactants stabilizers or other chemicals that modify the properties of the material. For example the presence of surfactant in the material may promote entry of the material into small openings in the formation.

Material may be introduced into the formation through freeze well wellbores. The material may be allowed to set. The integrity of the wall formed by the material may be checked. The integrity of the material wall may be checked by logging techniques and or by hydrostatic testing. If the permeability of a section formed by the material is too high additional material may be introduced into the formation through freeze well wellbores. After the permeability of the section is sufficiently reduced freeze wells may be installed in the freeze well wellbores.

Material may be injected into the formation at a pressure that is high but below the fracture pressure of the formation. In some embodiments injection of material is performed in 16 m increments in the freeze wellbore. Larger or smaller increments may be used if desired. In some embodiments material is only applied to certain portions of the formation. For example material may be applied to the formation through the freeze wellbore only adjacent to aquifer zones and or to relatively high permeability zones for example zones with a permeability greater than about 0.1 darcy . Applying material to aquifers may inhibit migration of water from one aquifer to a different aquifer. For material placed in the formation through freeze well wellbores the material may inhibit water migration between aquifers during formation of the low temperature zone. The material may also inhibit water migration between aquifers when an established low temperature zone is allowed to thaw.

In some embodiments the material used to form a barrier may be fine cement and micro fine cement. Cement may provide structural support in the formation. Fine cement may be ASTM type 3 Portland cement. Fine cement may be less expensive than micro fine cement. In an embodiment a freeze wellbore is formed in the formation. Selected portions of the freeze wellbore are grouted using fine cement. Then micro fine cement is injected into the formation through the freeze wellbore. The fine cement may reduce the permeability down to about 10 millidarcy. The micro fine cement may further reduce the permeability to about 0.1 millidarcy. After the grout is introduced into the formation a freeze wellbore canister may be inserted into the formation. The process may be repeated for each freeze well that will be used to form the barrier.

In some embodiments fine cement is introduced into every other freeze wellbore. Micro fine cement is introduced into the remaining wellbores. For example grout may be used in a formation with freeze wellbores set at about 5 m spacing. A first wellbore is drilled and fine cement is introduced into the formation through the wellbore. A freeze well canister is positioned in the first wellbore. A second wellbore is drilled 10 m away from the first wellbore. Fine cement is introduced into the formation through the second wellbore. A freeze well canister is positioned in the second wellbore. A third wellbore is drilled between the first wellbore and the second wellbore. In some embodiments grout from the first and or second wellbores may be detected in the cuttings of the third wellbore. Micro fine cement is introduced into the formation through the third wellbore. A freeze wellbore canister is positioned in the third wellbore. The same procedure is used to form the remaining freeze wells that will form the barrier around the treatment area.

In some embodiments material including wax is used to form a barrier in a formation. Wax barriers may be formed in wet dry or oil wetted formations. Wax barriers may be formed above at the bottom of and or below the water table. Material including liquid wax introduced into the formation may permeate into adjacent rock and fractures in the formation. The material may permeate into rock to fill microscopic as well as macroscopic pores and vugs in the rock. The wax solidifies to form a barrier that inhibits fluid flow into or out of a treatment area. A wax barrier may provide a minimal amount of structural support in the formation. Molten wax may reduce the strength of poorly consolidated soil by reducing inter grain friction so that the poorly consolidated soil sloughs or liquefies. Poorly consolidated layers may be consolidated by use of cement or other binding agents before introduction of molten wax.

In some embodiments the formation where a wax barrier is to be established is dewatered before and or during formation of the wax barrier. In some embodiments the portion of the formation where the wax barrier is to form is dewatered or diluted to remove or reduce saline water that could adversely affect the properties of the material introduced into the formation to form the wax barrier.

In some embodiments water is introduced into the formation during formation of the wax barrier. Water may be introduced into the formation when the barrier is to be formed below the water table or in a dry portion of the formation. The water may be used to heat the formation to a desired temperature before introducing the material that forms the wax barrier. The water may be introduced at an elevated temperature and or the water may be heated in the formation from one or more heaters.

The wax of the barrier may be a branched paraffin to inhibit biological degradation of the wax. The wax may include stabilizers surfactants or other chemicals that modify the physical and or chemical properties of the wax. The physical properties may be tailored to meet specific needs. The wax may melt at a relative low temperature for example the wax may have a typical melting point of about 52 C. . The temperature at which the wax congeals may be at least 5 C. 10 C. 20 C. or 30 C. above the ambient temperature of the formation prior to any heating of the formation. When molten the wax may have a relatively low viscosity for example 4 to 10 cp at about 99 C. . The flash point of the wax may be relatively high for example the flash point may be over 204 C. . The wax may have a density less than the density of water and may have a heat capacity that is less than half the heat capacity of water. The solid wax may have a low thermal conductivity for example about 0.18 W m C. so that the solid wax is a thermal insulator. Waxes suitable for forming a barrier are available as WAXFIX from Carter Technologies Company Sugar Land Tex. U.S.A. . WAXFIX is very resistant to microbial attack. WAXFIX may have a half life of greater than 5000 years.

In some embodiments a wax barrier or wax barriers may be used as the barriers for the in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments a wax barrier may be used in conjunction with freeze wells that form a low temperature barrier around the treatment area. In some embodiments the wax barrier is formed and freeze wells are installed in the wellbores used for introducing wax into the formation. In some embodiments the wax barrier is formed in wellbores offset from the freeze well wellbores. The wax barrier may be on the outside or the inside of the freeze wells. In some embodiments a wax barrier may be formed on both the inside and outside of the freeze wells. The wax barrier may inhibit water flow in the formation that would inhibit the formation of the low temperature zone by the freeze wells. In some embodiments a wax barrier is formed in the inter barrier zone between two freeze barriers of a double barrier system.

Material used to form the wax barrier may be introduced into the formation through wellbores. The wellbores may include vertical wellbores slanted wellbores and or horizontal wellbores for example wellbores with sections that are horizontally or near horizontally oriented . The use of vertical wellbores slanted wellbores and or horizontal wellbores for forming the wax barrier allows the formation of a barrier that seals both horizontal and vertical fractures.

Wellbores may be formed in the formation around the treatment area at a close spacing. In some embodiments the spacing is from about 1.5 m to about 4 m. Larger or smaller spacings may be used. Low temperature heaters may be inserted in the wellbores. The heaters may operate at temperatures from about 260 C. to about 320 C. so that the temperature at the formation face is below the pyrolysis temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation. The heaters may be activated to heat the formation until the overlap between two adjacent heaters raises the temperature of the zone between the two heaters above the melting temperature of the wax. Heating the formation to obtain superposition of heat with a temperature above the melting temperature of the wax may take one month two months or longer. After heating the heaters may be turned off. In some embodiments the heaters are downhole antennas that operate at about 10 MHz to heat the formation.

After heating the material used to form the wax barrier may be introduced into the wellbores to form the barrier. The material may flow into the formation and fill any fractures and porosity that has been heated. The wax in the material congeals when the wax flows to cold regions beyond the heated circumference. This wax barrier formation method may form a more complete barrier than some other methods of wax barrier formation but the time for heating may be longer than for some of the other methods. Also if a low temperature barrier is to be formed with the freeze wells placed in the wellbores used for injection of the material used to form the barrier the freeze wells will have to remove the heat supplied to the formation to allow for introduction of the material used to form the barrier. The low temperature barrier may take longer to form.

In some embodiments the wax barrier may be formed using a conduit placed in the wellbore. depicts an embodiment of a system for forming a wax barrier in a formation. Wellbore may extend into one or more layers below overburden . Wellbore may be an open wellbore below overburden . One or more of the layers may include fracture systems . One or more of the layers may be vuggy so that the layer or a portion of the layer has a high porosity. Conduit may be positioned in wellbore . In some embodiments low temperature heater may be strapped or attached to conduit . In some embodiments conduit may be a heater element. Heater may be operated so that the heater does not cause pyrolysis of hydrocarbons adjacent to the heater. At least a portion of wellbore may be filled with fluid. The fluid may be formation fluid or water. Heater may be activated to heat the fluid. A portion of the heated fluid may move outwards from heater into the formation. The heated fluid may be injected into the fractures and permeable vuggy zones. The heated fluid may be injected into the fractures and permeable vuggy zones by introducing heated barrier material into wellbore in the annular space between conduit and the wellbore. The introduced material flows to the areas heated by the fluid and congeals when the fluid reaches cold regions not heated by the fluid. The material fills fracture systems and permeable vuggy pathways heated by the fluid but the material may not permeate through a significant portion of the rock matrix as when the hot material is introduced into a heated formation as described above. The material flows into fracture systems a sufficient distance to join with material injected from an adjacent well so that a barrier to fluid flow through the fracture systems forms when the wax congeals. A portion of material may congeal along the wall of a fracture or a vug without completely blocking the fracture or filling the vug. The congealed material may act as an insulator and allow additional liquid wax to flow beyond the congealed portion to penetrate deeply into the formation and form blockages to fluid flow when the material cools below the melting temperature of the wax in the material.

Material in the annular space of wellbore between conduit and the formation may be removed through conduit by displacing the material with water or other fluid. Conduit may be removed and a freeze well may be installed in the wellbore. This method may use less material than the method described above. The heating of the fluid may be accomplished in less than a week or within a day. The small amount of heat input may allow for quicker formation of a low temperature barrier if freeze wells are to be positioned in the wellbores used to introduce material into the formation.

In some embodiments a heater may be suspended in the well without a conduit that allows for removal of excess material from the wellbore. The material may be introduced into the well. After material introduction the heater may be removed from the well. In some embodiments a conduit may be positioned in the wellbore but a heater may not be coupled to the conduit. Hot material may be circulated through the conduit so that the wax enters fractures systems and or vugs adjacent to the wellbore.

In some embodiments material may be used during the formation of a wellbore to improve inter zonal isolation and protect a low pressure zone from inflow from a high pressure zone. During wellbore formation where a high pressure zone and a low pressure zone are penetrated by a common wellbore it is possible for fluid from the high pressure zone to flow into the low pressure zone and cause an underground blowout. To avoid this the wellbore may be formed through the first zone. Then an intermediate casing may be set and cemented through the first zone. Setting casing may be time consuming and expensive. Instead of setting a casing material may be introduced to form a wax barrier that seals the first zone. The material may also inhibit or prevent mixing of high salinity brines from lower high pressure zones with fresher brines in upper lower pressure zones.

In some embodiments a material including wax may be used to contain and inhibit migration in a subsurface formation that has liquid hydrocarbon contaminants for example compounds such as benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene condensed in fractures in the formation. The location of the contaminants may be surrounded with heated injection wells. The material may be introduced into the wells to form an outer wax barrier. The material injected into the fractures from the injection wells may mix with the contaminants. The contaminants may be solubilized into the material. When the material congeals the contaminants may be permanently contained in the solid wax phase of the material.

In some embodiments a portion or all of the wax barrier may be removed after completion of the in situ heat treatment process. Removing all or a portion of the wax barrier may allow fluid to flow into and out of the treatment area of the in situ heat treatment process. Removing all or a portion of the wax barrier may return flow conditions in the formation to substantially the same conditions as existed before the in situ heat treatment process. To remove a portion or all of the wax barrier heaters may be used to heat the formation adjacent to the wax barrier. In some embodiments the heaters raise the temperature above the decomposition temperature of the material forming the wax barrier. In some embodiments the heaters raise the temperature above the melting temperature of the material forming the wax barrier. Fluid for example water may be introduced into the formation to drive the molten material to one or more production wells positioned in the formation. The production wells may remove the material from the formation.

In some embodiments a composition that includes a cross linkable polymer may be used with or in addition to a material that includes wax to form the barrier. Such composition may be provided to the formation as is described above for the material that includes wax. The composition may be configured to react and solidify after a selected time in the formation thereby allowing the composition to be provided as a liquid to the formation. The cross linkable polymer may include for example acrylates methacrylates urethanes and or epoxies. A cross linking initiator may be included in the composition. The composition may also include a cross linking inhibitor. The cross linking inhibitor may be configured to degrade while in the formation thereby allowing the composition to solidify.

In situ heat treatment processes and solution mining processes may heat the treatment area remove mass from the treatment area and greatly increase the permeability of the treatment area. In certain embodiments the treatment area after being treated may have a permeability of at least 0.1 darcy. In some embodiments the treatment area after being treated has a permeability of at least 1 darcy of at least 10 darcy or of at least 100 darcy. The increased permeability allows the fluid to spread in the formation into fractures microfractures and or pore spaces in the formation. Outside of the treatment area the permeability may remain at the initial permeability of the formation. The increased permeability allows fluid introduced to flow easily within the formation.

In certain embodiments a barrier may be formed in the formation after a solution mining process and or an in situ heat treatment process by introducing a fluid into the formation. The barrier may inhibit formation fluid from entering the treatment area after the solution mining and or in situ heat treatment processes have ended. The barrier formed by introducing fluid into the formation may allow for isolation of the treatment area.

The fluid introduced into the formation to form a barrier may include wax bitumen heavy oil sulfur polymer gel saturated saline solution and or one or more reactants that react to form a precipitate solid or high viscosity fluid in the formation. In some embodiments bitumen heavy oil reactants and or sulfur used to form the barrier are obtained from treatment facilities associated with the in situ heat treatment process. For example sulfur may be obtained from a Claus process used to treat produced gases to remove hydrogen sulfide and other sulfur compounds.

The fluid may be introduced into the formation as a liquid vapor or mixed phase fluid. The fluid may be introduced into a portion of the formation that is at an elevated temperature. In some embodiments the fluid is introduced into the formation through wells located near a perimeter of the treatment area. The fluid may be directed away from the treatment area. The elevated temperature of the formation maintains or allows the fluid to have a low viscosity so that the fluid moves away from the wells. A portion of the fluid may spread outwards in the formation towards a cooler portion of the formation. The relatively high permeability of the formation allows fluid introduced from one wellbore to spread and mix with fluid introduced from other wellbores. In the cooler portion of the formation the viscosity of the fluid increases a portion of the fluid precipitates and or the fluid solidifies or thickens so that the fluid forms the barrier to flow of formation fluid into or out of the treatment area.

In some embodiments a low temperature barrier formed by freeze wells surrounds all or a portion of the treatment area. As the fluid introduced into the formation approaches the low temperature barrier the temperature of the formation becomes colder. The colder temperature increases the viscosity of the fluid enhances precipitation and or solidifies the fluid to form the barrier to the flow of formation fluid into or out of the formation. The fluid may remain in the formation as a highly viscous fluid or a solid after the low temperature barrier has dissipated.

In certain embodiments saturated saline solution is introduced into the formation. Components in the saturated saline solution may precipitate out of solution when the solution reaches a colder temperature. The solidified particles may form the barrier to the flow of formation fluid into or out of the formation. The solidified components may be substantially insoluble in formation fluid.

In certain embodiments brine is introduced into the formation as a reactant. A second reactant such as carbon dioxide may be introduced into the formation to react with the brine. The reaction may generate a mineral complex that grows in the formation. The mineral complex may be substantially insoluble to formation fluid. In an embodiment the brine solution includes a sodium and aluminum solution. The second reactant introduced in the formation is carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide reacts with the brine solution to produce dawsonite. The minerals may solidify and form the barrier to the flow of formation fluid into or out of the formation.

In some embodiments the barrier may be formed around a treatment area using sulfur. Advantageously elemental sulfur is insoluble in water. Liquid and or solid sulfur in the formation may form a barrier to formation fluid flow into or out of the treatment area.

A sulfur barrier may be established in the formation during or before initiation of heating to heat the treatment area of the in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments sulfur may be introduced into wellbores in the formation that are located between the treatment area and a first barrier for example a low temperature barrier established by freeze wells . The formation adjacent to the wellbores that the sulfur is introduced into may be dewatered. In some embodiments the formation adjacent to the wellbores that the sulfur is introduced into is heated to facilitate removal of water and to prepare the wellbores and adjacent formation for the introduction of sulfur. The formation adjacent to the wellbores may be heated to a temperature below the pyrolysis temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation. The formation may be heated so that the temperature of a portion of the formation between two adjacent heaters is influenced by both heaters. In some embodiments the heat may increase the permeability of the formation so that a first wellbore is in fluid communication with an adjacent wellbore.

After the formation adjacent to the wellbores is heated molten sulfur at a temperature below the pyrolysis temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation is introduced into the formation. Over a certain temperature range the viscosity of molten sulfur increases with increasing temperature. The molten sulfur introduced into the formation may be near the melting temperature of sulfur about 115 C. so that the sulfur has a relatively low viscosity about 4 10 cp . Heaters in the wellbores may be temperature limited heaters with Curie temperatures near the melting temperature of sulfur so that the temperature of the molten sulfur stays relatively constant and below temperatures resulting in the formation of viscous molten sulfur. In some embodiments the region adjacent to the wellbores may be heated to a temperature above the melting point of sulfur but below the pyrolysis temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation. The heaters may be turned off and the temperature in the wellbores may be monitored for example using a fiber optic temperature monitoring system . When the temperature in the wellbore cools to a temperature near the melting temperature of sulfur molten sulfur may be introduced into the formation.

The sulfur introduced into the formation is allowed to flow and diffuse into the formation from the wellbores. As the sulfur enters portions of the formation below the melting temperature the sulfur solidifies and forms a barrier to fluid flow in the formation. Sulfur may be introduced until the formation is not able to accept additional sulfur. Heating may be stopped and the formation may be allowed to naturally cool so that the sulfur in the formation solidifies. After introduction of the sulfur the integrity of the formed barrier may be tested using pulse tests and or tracer tests.

A barrier may be formed around the treatment area after the in situ heat treatment process. The sulfur may form a substantially permanent barrier in the formation. In some embodiments a low temperature barrier formed by freeze wells surrounds the treatment area. Sulfur may be introduced on one or both sides of the low temperature barrier to form a barrier in the formation. The sulfur may be introduced into the formation as vapor or a liquid. As the sulfur approaches the low temperature barrier the sulfur may condense and or solidify in the formation to form the barrier.

In some embodiments the sulfur may be introduced in the heated portion of the portion. The sulfur may be introduced into the formation through wells located near the perimeter of the treatment area. The temperature of the formation may be hotter than the vaporization temperature of sulfur about 445 C. . The sulfur may be introduced as a liquid vapor or mixed phase fluid. If a part of the introduced sulfur is in the liquid phase the heat of the formation may vaporize the sulfur. The sulfur may flow outwards from the introduction wells towards cooler portions of the formation. The sulfur may condense and or solidify in the formation to form the barrier.

In some embodiments the Claus reaction may be used to form sulfur in the formation after the in situ heat treatment process. The Claus reaction is a gas phase equilibrium reaction. The Claus reaction is 4HS 2SO3S 4HO EQN. 1 

Hydrogen sulfide may be obtained by separating the hydrogen sulfide from the produced fluid of an ongoing in situ heat treatment process. A portion of the hydrogen sulfide may be burned to form the needed sulfur dioxide. Hydrogen sulfide may be introduced into the formation through a number of wells in the formation. Sulfur dioxide may be introduced into the formation through other wells. The wells used for injecting sulfur dioxide or hydrogen sulfide may have been production wells heater wells monitor wells or other type of well during the in situ heat treatment process. The wells used for injecting sulfur dioxide or hydrogen sulfide may be near the perimeter of the treatment area. The number of wells may be enough so that the formation in the vicinity of the injection wells does not cool to a point where the sulfur dioxide and the hydrogen sulfide can form sulfur and condense rather than remain in the vapor phase. The wells used to introduce the sulfur dioxide into the formation may also be near the perimeter of the treatment area. In some embodiments the hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide may be introduced into the formation through the same wells for example through two conduits positioned in the same wellbore . The hydrogen sulfide and the sulfur dioxide may react in the formation to form sulfur and water. The sulfur may flow outwards in the formation and condense and or solidify to form the barrier in the formation.

The sulfur barrier may form in the formation beyond the area where hydrocarbons in formation fluid generated by the heat treatment process condense in the formation. Regions near the perimeter of the treated area may be at lower temperatures than the treated area. Sulfur may condense and or solidify from the vapor phase in these lower temperature regions. Additional hydrogen sulfide and or sulfur dioxide may diffuse to these lower temperature regions. Additional sulfur may form by the Claus reaction to maintain an equilibrium concentration of sulfur in the vapor phase. Eventually a sulfur barrier may form around the treated zone. The vapor phase in the treated region may remain as an equilibrium mixture of sulfur hydrogen sulfide sulfur dioxide water vapor and other vapor products present or evolving from the formation.

The conversion to sulfur is favored at lower temperatures so the conversion of hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide to sulfur may take place a distance away from the wells that introduce the reactants into the formation. The Claus reaction may result in the formation of sulfur where the temperature of the formation is cooler for example where the temperature of the formation is at temperatures from about 180 C. to about 240 C. .

A temperature monitoring system may be installed in wellbores of freeze wells and or in monitor wells adjacent to the freeze wells to monitor the temperature profile of the freeze wells and or the low temperature zone established by the freeze wells. The monitoring system may be used to monitor progress of low temperature zone formation. The monitoring system may be used to determine the location of high temperature areas potential breakthrough locations or breakthrough locations after the low temperature zone has formed. Periodic monitoring of the temperature profile of the freeze wells and or low temperature zone established by the freeze wells may allow additional cooling to be provided to potential trouble areas before breakthrough occurs. Additional cooling may be provided at or adjacent to breakthroughs and high temperature areas to ensure the integrity of the low temperature zone around the treatment area. Additional cooling may be provided by increasing refrigerant flow through selected freeze wells installing an additional freeze well or freeze wells and or by providing a cryogenic fluid such as liquid nitrogen to the high temperature areas. Providing additional cooling to potential problem areas before breakthrough occurs may be more time efficient and cost efficient than sealing a breach reheating a portion of the treatment area that has been cooled by influx of fluid and or remediating an area outside of the breached frozen barrier.

In some embodiments a traveling thermocouple may be used to monitor the temperature profile of selected freeze wells or monitor wells. In some embodiments the temperature monitoring system includes thermocouples placed at discrete locations in the wellbores of the freeze wells in the freeze wells and or in the monitoring wells. In some embodiments the temperature monitoring system comprises a fiber optic temperature monitoring system.

Fiber optic temperature monitoring systems are available from Sensornet London United Kingdom Sensa Houston Tex. U.S.A. Luna Energy Blacksburg Va. U.S.A. Lios Technology GMBH Cologne Germany Oxford Electronics Ltd. Hampshire United Kingdom and Sabeus Sensor Systems Calabasas Calif. U.S.A. . The fiber optic temperature monitoring system includes a data system and one or more fiber optic cables. The data system includes one or more lasers for sending light to the fiber optic cable and one or more computers software and peripherals for receiving analyzing and outputting data. The data system may be coupled to one or more fiber optic cables.

A single fiber optic cable may be several kilometers long. The fiber optic cable may be installed in many freeze wells and or monitor wells. In some embodiments two fiber optic cables may be installed in each freeze well and or monitor well. The two fiber optic cables may be coupled. Using two fiber optic cables per well allows for compensation due to optical losses that occur in the wells and allows for better accuracy of measured temperature profiles.

The fiber optic temperature monitoring system may be used to detect the location of a breach or a potential breach in a frozen barrier. The search for potential breaches may be performed at scheduled intervals for example every two or three months. To determine the location of the breach or potential breach flow of formation refrigerant to the freeze wells of interest is stopped. In some embodiments the flow of formation refrigerant to all of the freeze wells is stopped. The rise in the temperature profiles as well as the rate of change of the temperature profiles provided by the fiber optic temperature monitoring system for each freeze well can be used to determine the location of any breaches or hot spots in the low temperature zone maintained by the freeze wells. The temperature profile monitored by the fiber optic temperature monitoring system for the two freeze wells closest to the hot spot or fluid flow will show the quickest and greatest rise in temperature. A temperature change of a few degrees Centigrade in the temperature profiles of the freeze wells closest to a troubled area may be sufficient to isolate the location of the trouble area. The shut down time of flow of circulation fluid in the freeze wells of interest needed to detect breaches potential breaches and hot spots may be on the order of a few hours or days depending on the well spacing and the amount of fluid flow affecting the low temperature zone.

Fiber optic temperature monitoring systems may also be used to monitor temperatures in heated portions of the formation during in situ heat treatment processes. The fiber of a fiber optic cable used in the heated portion of the formation may be clad with a reflective material to facilitate retention of a signal or signals transmitted down the fiber. In some embodiments the fiber is clad with gold copper nickel aluminum and or alloys thereof. The cladding may be formed of a material that is able to withstand chemical and temperature conditions in the heated portion of the formation. For example gold cladding may allow an optical sensor to be used up to temperatures of 700 C. In some embodiments the fiber is clad with aluminum. The fiber may be dipped in or run through a bath of liquid aluminum. The clad fiber may then be allowed to cool to secure the aluminum to the fiber. The gold or aluminum cladding may reduce hydrogen darkening of the optical fiber.

A potential source of heat loss from the heated formation is due to reflux in wells. Refluxing occurs when vapors condense in a well and flow into a portion of the well adjacent to the heated portion of the formation. Vapors may condense in the well adjacent to the overburden of the formation to form condensed fluid. Condensed fluid flowing into the well adjacent to the heated formation absorbs heat from the formation. Heat absorbed by condensed fluids cools the formation and necessitates additional energy input into the formation to maintain the formation at a desired temperature. Some fluids that condense in the overburden and flow into the portion of the well adjacent to the heated formation may react to produce undesired compounds and or coke. Inhibiting fluids from refluxing may significantly improve the thermal efficiency of the in situ heat treatment system and or the quality of the product produced from the in situ heat treatment system.

For some well embodiments the portion of the well adjacent to the overburden section of the formation is cemented to the formation. In some well embodiments the well includes packing material placed near the transition from the heated section of the formation to the overburden. The packing material inhibits formation fluid from passing from the heated section of the formation into the section of the wellbore adjacent to the overburden. Cables conduits devices and or instruments may pass through the packing material but the packing material inhibits formation fluid from passing up the wellbore adjacent to the overburden section of the formation.

In some embodiments one or more baffle systems may be placed in the wellbores to inhibit reflux. The baffle systems may be obstructions to fluid flow into the heated portion of the formation. In some embodiments refluxing fluid may revaporize on the baffle system before coming into contact with the heated portion of the formation.

In some embodiments a gas may be introduced into the formation through wellbores to inhibit reflux in the wellbores. In some embodiments gas may be introduced into wellbores that include baffle systems to inhibit reflux of fluid in the wellbores. The gas may be carbon dioxide methane nitrogen or other desired gas. In some embodiments the introduction of gas may be used in conjunction with one or more baffle systems in the wellbores. The introduced gas may enhance heat exchange at the baffle systems to help maintain top portions of the baffle systems colder than the lower portions of the baffle systems.

The flow of production fluid up the well to the surface is desired for some types of wells especially for production wells. Flow of production fluid up the well is also desirable for some heater wells that are used to control pressure in the formation. The overburden or a conduit in the well used to transport formation fluid from the heated portion of the formation to the surface may be heated to inhibit condensation on or in the conduit. Providing heat in the overburden however may be costly and or may lead to increased cracking or coking of formation fluid as the formation fluid is being produced from the formation.

To avoid the need to heat the overburden or to heat the conduit passing through the overburden one or more diverters may be placed in the wellbore to inhibit fluid from refluxing into the wellbore adjacent to the heated portion of the formation. In some embodiments the diverter retains fluid above the heated portion of the formation. Fluids retained in the diverter may be removed from the diverter using a pump gas lifting and or other fluid removal technique. In certain embodiments two or more diverters that retain fluid above the heated portion of the formation may be located in the production well. Two or more diverters provide a simple way of separating initial fractions of condensed fluid produced from the in situ heat treatment system. A pump may be placed in each of the diverters to remove condensed fluid from the diverters.

In some embodiments the diverter directs fluid to a sump below the heated portion of the formation. An inlet for a lift system may be located in the sump. In some embodiments the intake of the lift system is located in casing in the sump. In some embodiments the intake of the lift system is located in an open wellbore. The sump is below the heated portion of the formation. The intake of the pump may be located 1 m 5 m 10 m 20 m or more below the deepest heater used to heat the heated portion of the formation. The sump may be at a cooler temperature than the heated portion of the formation. The sump may be more than 10 C. more than 50 C. more than 75 C. or more than 100 C. below the temperature of the heated portion of the formation. A portion of the fluid entering the sump may be liquid. A portion of the fluid entering the sump may condense within the sump. The lift system moves the fluid in the sump to the surface.

Production well lift systems may be used to efficiently transport formation fluid from the bottom of the production wells to the surface. Production well lift systems may provide and maintain the maximum required well drawdown minimum reservoir producing pressure and producing rates. The production well lift systems may operate efficiently over a wide range of high temperature multiphase fluids gas vapor steam water hydrocarbon liquids and production rates expected during the life of a typical project. Production well lift systems may include dual concentric rod pump lift systems chamber lift systems and other types of lift systems.

Temperature limited heaters may be in configurations and or may include materials that provide automatic temperature limiting properties for the heater at certain temperatures. In certain embodiments ferromagnetic materials are used in temperature limited heaters. Ferromagnetic material may self limit temperature at or near the Curie temperature of the material and or the phase transformation temperature range to provide a reduced amount of heat when a time varying current is applied to the material. In certain embodiments the ferromagnetic material self limits temperature of the temperature limited heater at a selected temperature that is approximately the Curie temperature and or in the phase transformation temperature range. In certain embodiments the selected temperature is within about 35 C. within about 25 C. within about 20 C. or within about 10 C. of the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range. In certain embodiments ferromagnetic materials are coupled with other materials for example highly conductive materials high strength materials corrosion resistant materials or combinations thereof to provide various electrical and or mechanical properties. Some parts of the temperature limited heater may have a lower resistance caused by different geometries and or by using different ferromagnetic and or non ferromagnetic materials than other parts of the temperature limited heater. Having parts of the temperature limited heater with various materials and or dimensions allows for tailoring the desired heat output from each part of the heater.

Temperature limited heaters may be more reliable than other heaters. Temperature limited heaters may be less apt to break down or fail due to hot spots in the formation. In some embodiments temperature limited heaters allow for substantially uniform heating of the formation. In some embodiments temperature limited heaters are able to heat the formation more efficiently by operating at a higher average heat output along the entire length of the heater. The temperature limited heater operates at the higher average heat output along the entire length of the heater because power to the heater does not have to be reduced to the entire heater as is the case with typical constant wattage heaters if a temperature along any point of the heater exceeds or is about to exceed a maximum operating temperature of the heater. Heat output from portions of a temperature limited heater approaching a Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of the heater automatically reduces without controlled adjustment of the time varying current applied to the heater. The heat output automatically reduces due to changes in electrical properties for example electrical resistance of portions of the temperature limited heater. Thus more power is supplied by the temperature limited heater during a greater portion of a heating process.

In certain embodiments the system including temperature limited heaters initially provides a first heat output and then provides a reduced second heat output heat output near at or above the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of an electrically resistive portion of the heater when the temperature limited heater is energized by a time varying current. The first heat output is the heat output at temperatures below which the temperature limited heater begins to self limit. In some embodiments the first heat output is the heat output at a temperature about 50 C. about 75 C. about 100 C. or about 125 C. below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic material in the temperature limited heater.

The temperature limited heater may be energized by time varying current alternating current or modulated direct current supplied at the wellhead. The wellhead may include a power source and other components for example modulation components transformers and or capacitors used in supplying power to the temperature limited heater. The temperature limited heater may be one of many heaters used to heat a portion of the formation.

In certain embodiments the temperature limited heater includes a conductor that operates as a skin effect or proximity effect heater when time varying current is applied to the conductor. The skin effect limits the depth of current penetration into the interior of the conductor. For ferromagnetic materials the skin effect is dominated by the magnetic permeability of the conductor. The relative magnetic permeability of ferromagnetic materials is typically between 10 and 1000 for example the relative magnetic permeability of ferromagnetic materials is typically at least 10 and may be at least 50 100 500 1000 or greater . As the temperature of the ferromagnetic material is raised above the Curie temperature or the phase transformation temperature range and or as the applied electrical current is increased the magnetic permeability of the ferromagnetic material decreases substantially and the skin depth expands rapidly for example the skin depth expands as the inverse square root of the magnetic permeability . The reduction in magnetic permeability results in a decrease in the AC or modulated DC resistance of the conductor near at or above the Curie temperature the phase transformation temperature range and or as the applied electrical current is increased. When the temperature limited heater is powered by a substantially constant current source portions of the heater that approach reach or are above the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range may have reduced heat dissipation. Sections of the temperature limited heater that are not at or near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range may be dominated by skin effect heating that allows the heater to have high heat dissipation due to a higher resistive load.

Curie temperature heaters have been used in soldering equipment heaters for medical applications and heating elements for ovens for example pizza ovens . Some of these uses are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 579 575 to Lamome et al. 5 065 501 to Henschen et al. and 5 512 732 to Yagnik et al. all of which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. U.S. Pat. No. 4 849 611 to Whitney et al. which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein describes a plurality of discrete spaced apart heating units including a reactive component a resistive heating component and a temperature responsive component.

An advantage of using the temperature limited heater to heat hydrocarbons in the formation is that the conductor is chosen to have a Curie temperature and or a phase transformation temperature range in a desired range of temperature operation. Operation within the desired operating temperature range allows substantial heat injection into the formation while maintaining the temperature of the temperature limited heater and other equipment below design limit temperatures. Design limit temperatures are temperatures at which properties such as corrosion creep and or deformation are adversely affected. The temperature limiting properties of the temperature limited heater inhibit overheating or burnout of the heater adjacent to low thermal conductivity hot spots in the formation. In some embodiments the temperature limited heater is able to lower or control heat output and or withstand heat at temperatures above 25 C. 37 C. 100 C. 250 C. 500 C. 700 C. 800 C. 900 C. or higher up to 1131 C. depending on the materials used in the heater.

The temperature limited heater allows for more heat injection into the formation than constant wattage heaters because the energy input into the temperature limited heater does not have to be limited to accommodate low thermal conductivity regions adjacent to the heater. For example in Green River oil shale there is a difference of at least a factor of 3 in the thermal conductivity of the lowest richness oil shale layers and the highest richness oil shale layers. When heating such a formation substantially more heat is transferred to the formation with the temperature limited heater than with the conventional heater that is limited by the temperature at low thermal conductivity layers. The heat output along the entire length of the conventional heater needs to accommodate the low thermal conductivity layers so that the heater does not overheat at the low thermal conductivity layers and burn out. The heat output adjacent to the low thermal conductivity layers that are at high temperature will reduce for the temperature limited heater but the remaining portions of the temperature limited heater that are not at high temperature will still provide high heat output. Because heaters for heating hydrocarbon formations typically have long lengths for example at least 10 m 100 m 300 m 500 m 1 km or more up to about 10 km the majority of the length of the temperature limited heater may be operating below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range while only a few portions are at or near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of the temperature limited heater.

The use of temperature limited heaters allows for efficient transfer of heat to the formation. Efficient transfer of heat allows for reduction in time needed to heat the formation to a desired temperature. For example in Green River oil shale pyrolysis typically requires 9.5 years to 10 years of heating when using a 12 m heater well spacing with conventional constant wattage heaters. For the same heater spacing temperature limited heaters may allow a larger average heat output while maintaining heater equipment temperatures below equipment design limit temperatures. Pyrolysis in the formation may occur at an earlier time with the larger average heat output provided by temperature limited heaters than the lower average heat output provided by constant wattage heaters. For example in Green River oil shale pyrolysis may occur in 5 years using temperature limited heaters with a 12 m heater well spacing. Temperature limited heaters counteract hot spots due to inaccurate well spacing or drilling where heater wells come too close together. In certain embodiments temperature limited heaters allow for increased power output over time for heater wells that have been spaced too far apart or limit power output for heater wells that are spaced too close together. Temperature limited heaters also supply more power in regions adjacent the overburden and underburden to compensate for temperature losses in these regions.

Temperature limited heaters may be advantageously used in many types of formations. For example in tar sands formations or relatively permeable formations containing heavy hydrocarbons temperature limited heaters may be used to provide a controllable low temperature output for reducing the viscosity of fluids mobilizing fluids and or enhancing the radial flow of fluids at or near the wellbore or in the formation. Temperature limited heaters may be used to inhibit excess coke formation due to overheating of the near wellbore region of the formation.

The use of temperature limited heaters in some embodiments eliminates or reduces the need for expensive temperature control circuitry. For example the use of temperature limited heaters eliminates or reduces the need to perform temperature logging and or the need to use fixed thermocouples on the heaters to monitor potential overheating at hot spots.

In certain embodiments phase transformation for example crystalline phase transformation or a change in the crystal structure of materials used in a temperature limited heater change the selected temperature at which the heater self limits. Ferromagnetic material used in the temperature limited heater may have a phase transformation for example a transformation from ferrite to austenite that decreases the magnetic permeability of the ferromagnetic material. This reduction in magnetic permeability is similar to reduction in magnetic permeability due to the magnetic transition of the ferromagnetic material at the Curie temperature. The Curie temperature is the magnetic transition temperature of the ferrite phase of the ferromagnetic material. The reduction in magnetic permeability results in a decrease in the AC or modulated DC resistance of the temperature limited heater near at or above the temperature of the phase transformation and or the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material.

The phase transformation of the ferromagnetic material may occur over a temperature range. The temperature range of the phase transformation depends on the ferromagnetic material and may vary for example over a range of about 5 C. to a range of about 200 C. Because the phase transformation takes place over a temperature range the reduction in the magnetic permeability due to the phase transformation takes place over the temperature range. The reduction in magnetic permeability may also occur hysteretically over the temperature range of the phase transformation. In some embodiments the phase transformation back to the lower temperature phase of the ferromagnetic material is slower than the phase transformation to the higher temperature phase for example the transition from austenite back to ferrite is slower than the transition from ferrite to austenite . The slower phase transformation back to the lower temperature phase may cause hysteretic operation of the heater at or near the phase transformation temperature range that allows the heater to slowly increase to higher resistance after the resistance of the heater reduces due to high temperature.

In some embodiments the phase transformation temperature range overlaps with the reduction in the magnetic permeability when the temperature approaches the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material. The overlap may produce a faster drop in electrical resistance versus temperature than if the reduction in magnetic permeability is solely due to the temperature approaching the Curie temperature. The overlap may also produce hysteretic behavior of the temperature limited heater near the Curie temperature and or in the phase transformation temperature range.

In certain embodiments the hysteretic operation due to the phase transformation is a smoother transition than the reduction in magnetic permeability due to magnetic transition at the Curie temperature. The smoother transition may be easier to control for example electrical control using a process control device that interacts with the power supply than the sharper transition at the Curie temperature. In some embodiments the Curie temperature is located inside the phase transformation range for selected metallurgies used in temperature limited heaters. This phenomenon provides temperature limited heaters with the smooth transition properties of the phase transformation in addition to a sharp and definite transition due to the reduction in magnetic properties at the Curie temperature. Such temperature limited heaters may be easy to control due to the phase transformation while providing finite temperature limits due to the sharp Curie temperature transition . Using the phase transformation temperature range instead of and or in addition to the Curie temperature in temperature limited heaters increases the number and range of metallurgies that may be used for temperature limited heaters.

In certain embodiments alloy additions are made to the ferromagnetic material to adjust the temperature range of the phase transformation. For example adding carbon to the ferromagnetic material may increase the phase transformation temperature range and lower the onset temperature of the phase transformation. Adding titanium to the ferromagnetic material may increase the onset temperature of the phase transformation and decrease the phase transformation temperature range. Alloy compositions may be adjusted to provide desired Curie temperature and phase transformation properties for the ferromagnetic material. The alloy composition of the ferromagnetic material may be chosen based on desired properties for the ferromagnetic material such as but not limited to magnetic permeability transition temperature or temperature range resistance versus temperature profile or power output . Addition of titanium may allow higher Curie temperatures to be obtained when adding cobalt to 410 stainless steel by raising the ferrite to austenite phase transformation temperature range to a temperature range that is above or well above the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material.

In some embodiments temperature limited heaters are more economical to manufacture or make than standard heaters. Typical ferromagnetic materials include iron carbon steel or ferritic stainless steel. Such materials are inexpensive as compared to nickel based heating alloys such as nichrome Kanthal Bulten Kanthal AB Sweden and or LOHM Driver Harris Company Harrison N.J. U.S.A. typically used in insulated conductor mineral insulated cable heaters. In one embodiment of the temperature limited heater the temperature limited heater is manufactured in continuous lengths as an insulated conductor heater to lower costs and improve reliability.

In some embodiments the temperature limited heater is placed in the heater well using a coiled tubing rig. A heater that can be coiled on a spool may be manufactured by using metal such as ferritic stainless steel for example 409 stainless steel that is welded using electrical resistance welding ERW . U.S. Pat. No. 7 032 809 to Hopkins which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein describes forming seam welded pipe. To form a heater section a metal strip from a roll is passed through a former where it is shaped into a tubular and then longitudinally welded using ERW.

In some embodiments a composite tubular may be formed from the seam welded tubular. The seam welded tubular is passed through a second former where a conductive strip for example a copper strip is applied drawn down tightly on the tubular through a die and longitudinally welded using ERW. A sheath may be formed by longitudinally welding a support material for example steel such as 347H or 347HH over the conductive strip material. The support material may be a strip rolled over the conductive strip material. An overburden section of the heater may be formed in a similar manner.

In certain embodiments the overburden section uses a non ferromagnetic material such as 304 stainless steel or 316 stainless steel instead of a ferromagnetic material. The heater section and overburden section may be coupled using standard techniques such as butt welding using an orbital welder. In some embodiments the overburden section material the non ferromagnetic material may be pre welded to the ferromagnetic material before rolling. The pre welding may eliminate the need for a separate coupling step for example butt welding . In an embodiment a flexible cable for example a furnace cable such as a MGT 1000 furnace cable may be pulled through the center after forming the tubular heater. An end bushing on the flexible cable may be welded to the tubular heater to provide an electrical current return path. The tubular heater including the flexible cable may be coiled onto a spool before installation into a heater well. In an embodiment the temperature limited heater is installed using the coiled tubing rig. The coiled tubing rig may place the temperature limited heater in a deformation resistant container in the formation. The deformation resistant container may be placed in the heater well using conventional methods.

Temperature limited heaters may be used for heating hydrocarbon formations including but not limited to oil shale formations coal formations tar sands formations and formations with heavy viscous oils. Temperature limited heaters may also be used in the field of environmental remediation to vaporize or destroy soil contaminants. Embodiments of temperature limited heaters may be used to heat fluids in a wellbore or sub sea pipeline to inhibit deposition of paraffin or various hydrates. In some embodiments a temperature limited heater is used for solution mining a subsurface formation for example an oil shale or a coal formation . In certain embodiments a fluid for example molten salt is placed in a wellbore and heated with a temperature limited heater to inhibit deformation and or collapse of the wellbore. In some embodiments the temperature limited heater is attached to a sucker rod in the wellbore or is part of the sucker rod itself. In some embodiments temperature limited heaters are used to heat a near wellbore region to reduce near wellbore oil viscosity during production of high viscosity crude oils and during transport of high viscosity oils to the surface. In some embodiments a temperature limited heater enables gas lifting of a viscous oil by lowering the viscosity of the oil without coking the oil. Temperature limited heaters may be used in sulfur transfer lines to maintain temperatures between about 110 C. and about 130 C.

The ferromagnetic alloy or ferromagnetic alloys used in the temperature limited heater determine the Curie temperature of the heater. Curie temperature data for various metals is listed in American Institute of Physics Handbook Second Edition McGraw Hill pages 5 170 through 5 176. Ferromagnetic conductors may include one or more of the ferromagnetic elements iron cobalt and nickel and or alloys of these elements. In some embodiments ferromagnetic conductors include iron chromium Fe Cr alloys that contain tungsten W for example HCM12A and SAVE12 Sumitomo Metals Co. Japan and or iron alloys that contain chromium for example Fe Cr alloys Fe Cr W alloys Fe Cr V vanadium alloys and Fe Cr Nb Niobium alloys . Of the three main ferromagnetic elements iron has a Curie temperature of approximately 770 C. cobalt Co has a Curie temperature of approximately 1131 C. and nickel has a Curie temperature of approximately 358 C. An iron cobalt alloy has a Curie temperature higher than the Curie temperature of iron. For example iron cobalt alloy with 2 by weight cobalt has a Curie temperature of approximately 800 C. iron cobalt alloy with 12 by weight cobalt has a Curie temperature of approximately 900 C. and iron cobalt alloy with 20 by weight cobalt has a Curie temperature of approximately 950 C. Iron nickel alloy has a Curie temperature lower than the Curie temperature of iron. For example iron nickel alloy with 20 by weight nickel has a Curie temperature of approximately 720 C. and iron nickel alloy with 60 by weight nickel has a Curie temperature of approximately 560 C.

Some non ferromagnetic elements used as alloys raise the Curie temperature of iron. For example an iron vanadium alloy with 5.9 by weight vanadium has a Curie temperature of approximately 815 C. Other non ferromagnetic elements for example carbon aluminum copper silicon and or chromium may be alloyed with iron or other ferromagnetic materials to lower the Curie temperature. Non ferromagnetic materials that raise the Curie temperature may be combined with non ferromagnetic materials that lower the Curie temperature and alloyed with iron or other ferromagnetic materials to produce a material with a desired Curie temperature and other desired physical and or chemical properties. In some embodiments the Curie temperature material is a ferrite such as NiFeO. In other embodiments the Curie temperature material is a binary compound such as FeNior FeAl.

In some embodiments the improved alloy includes carbon cobalt iron manganese silicon or mixtures thereof. In certain embodiments the improved alloy includes by weight about 0.1 to about 10 cobalt about 0.1 carbon about 0.5 manganese about 0.5 silicon with the balance being iron. In certain embodiments the improved alloy includes by weight about 0.1 to about 10 cobalt about 0.1 carbon about 0.5 manganese about 0.5 silicon with the balance being iron.

In some embodiments the improved alloy includes chromium carbon cobalt iron manganese silicon titanium vanadium or mixtures thereof. In certain embodiments the improved alloy includes by weight about 5 to about 20 cobalt about 0.1 carbon about 0.5 manganese about 0.5 silicon about 0.1 to about 2 vanadium with the balance being iron. In some embodiments the improved alloy includes by weight about 12 chromium about 0.1 carbon about 0.5 silicon about 0.1 to about 0.5 manganese above 0 to about 15 cobalt above 0 to about 2 vanadium above 0 to about 1 titanium with the balance being iron. In some embodiments the improved alloy includes by weight about 12 chromium about 0.1 carbon about 0.5 silicon about 0.1 to about 0.5 manganese above 0 to about 2 vanadium above 0 to about 1 titanium with the balance being iron. In some embodiments the improved alloy includes by weight about 12 chromium about 0.1 carbon about 0.5 silicon about 0.1 to about 0.5 manganese above 0 to about 2 vanadium with the balance being iron. In certain embodiments the improved alloy includes by weight about 12 chromium about 0.1 carbon about 0.5 silicon about 0.1 to about 0.5 manganese above 0 to about 15 cobalt above 0 to about 1 titanium with the balance being iron. In certain embodiments the improved alloy includes by weight about 12 chromium about 0.1 carbon about 0.5 silicon about 0.1 to about 0.5 manganese above 0 to about 15 cobalt with the balance being iron. The addition of vanadium may allow for use of higher amounts of cobalt in the improved alloy.

Certain embodiments of temperature limited heaters may include more than one ferromagnetic material. Such embodiments are within the scope of embodiments described herein if any conditions described herein apply to at least one of the ferromagnetic materials in the temperature limited heater.

Ferromagnetic properties generally decay as the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range is approached. The Handbook of Electrical Heating for Industry by C. James Erickson IEEE Press 1995 shows a typical curve for 1 carbon steel steel with 1 carbon by weight . The loss of magnetic permeability starts at temperatures above 650 C. and tends to be complete when temperatures exceed 730 C. Thus the self limiting temperature may be somewhat below the actual Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor. The skin depth for current flow in 1 carbon steel is 0.132 cm at room temperature and increases to 0.445 cm at 720 C. From 720 C. to 730 C. the skin depth sharply increases to over 2.5 cm. Thus a temperature limited heater embodiment using 1 carbon steel begins to self limit between 650 C. and 730 C.

Skin depth generally defines an effective penetration depth of time varying current into the conductive material. In general current density decreases exponentially with distance from an outer surface to the center along the radius of the conductor. The depth at which the current density is approximately 1 e of the surface current density is called the skin depth. For a solid cylindrical rod with a diameter much greater than the penetration depth or for hollow cylinders with a wall thickness exceeding the penetration depth the skin depth is 1981.5 EQN. 2 in which 

Materials used in the temperature limited heater may be selected to provide a desired turndown ratio. Turndown ratios of at least 1.1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 10 1 30 1 or 50 1 may be selected for temperature limited heaters. Larger turndown ratios may also be used. A selected turndown ratio may depend on a number of factors including but not limited to the type of formation in which the temperature limited heater is located for example a higher turndown ratio may be used for an oil shale formation with large variations in thermal conductivity between rich and lean oil shale layers and or a temperature limit of materials used in the wellbore for example temperature limits of heater materials . In some embodiments the turndown ratio is increased by coupling additional copper or another good electrical conductor to the ferromagnetic material for example adding copper to lower the resistance above the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range .

The temperature limited heater may provide a maximum heat output power output below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of the heater. In certain embodiments the maximum heat output is at least 400 W m Watts per meter 600 W m 700 W m 800 W m or higher up to 2000 W m. The temperature limited heater reduces the amount of heat output by a section of the heater when the temperature of the section of the heater approaches or is above the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range. The reduced amount of heat may be substantially less than the heat output below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range. In some embodiments the reduced amount of heat is at most 400 W m 200 W m 100 W m or may approach 0 W m.

In certain embodiments the temperature limited heater operates substantially independently of the thermal load on the heater in a certain operating temperature range. Thermal load is the rate that heat is transferred from a heating system to its surroundings. It is to be understood that the thermal load may vary with temperature of the surroundings and or the thermal conductivity of the surroundings. In an embodiment the temperature limited heater operates at or above the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of the temperature limited heater such that the operating temperature of the heater increases at most by 3 C. 2 C. 1.5 C. 1 C. or 0.5 C. for a decrease in thermal load of 1 W m proximate to a portion of the heater. In certain embodiments the temperature limited heater operates in such a manner at a relatively constant current.

The AC or modulated DC resistance and or the heat output of the temperature limited heater may decrease as the temperature approaches the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range and decrease sharply near or above the Curie temperature due to the Curie effect and or phase transformation effect. In certain embodiments the value of the electrical resistance or heat output above or near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range is at most one half of the value of electrical resistance or heat output at a certain point below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range. In some embodiments the heat output above or near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range is at most 90 70 50 30 20 10 or less down to 1 of the heat output at a certain point below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range for example 30 C. below the Curie temperature 40 C. below the Curie temperature 50 C. below the Curie temperature or 100 C. below the Curie temperature . In certain embodiments the electrical resistance above or near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range decreases to 80 70 60 50 or less down to 1 of the electrical resistance at a certain point below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range for example 30 C. below the Curie temperature 40 C. below the Curie temperature 50 C. below the Curie temperature or 100 C. below the Curie temperature .

In some embodiments AC frequency is adjusted to change the skin depth of the ferromagnetic material. For example the skin depth of 1 carbon steel at room temperature is 0.132 cm at 60 Hz 0.0762 cm at 180 Hz and 0.046 cm at 440 Hz. Since heater diameter is typically larger than twice the skin depth using a higher frequency and thus a heater with a smaller diameter reduces heater costs. For a fixed geometry the higher frequency results in a higher turndown ratio. The turndown ratio at a higher frequency is calculated by multiplying the turndown ratio at a lower frequency by the square root of the higher frequency divided by the lower frequency. In some embodiments a frequency between 100 Hz and 1000 Hz between 140 Hz and 200 Hz or between 400 Hz and 600 Hz is used for example 180 Hz 540 Hz or 720 Hz . In some embodiments high frequencies may be used. The frequencies may be greater than 1000 Hz.

To maintain a substantially constant skin depth until the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of the temperature limited heater is reached the heater may be operated at a lower frequency when the heater is cold and operated at a higher frequency when the heater is hot. Line frequency heating is generally favorable however because there is less need for expensive components such as power supplies transformers or current modulators that alter frequency. Line frequency is the frequency of a general supply of current. Line frequency is typically 60 Hz but may be 50 Hz or another frequency depending on the source for the supply of the current. Higher frequencies may be produced using commercially available equipment such as solid state variable frequency power supplies. Transformers that convert three phase power to single phase power with three times the frequency are commercially available. For example high voltage three phase power at 60 Hz may be transformed to single phase power at 180 Hz and at a lower voltage. Such transformers are less expensive and more energy efficient than solid state variable frequency power supplies. In certain embodiments transformers that convert three phase power to single phase power are used to increase the frequency of power supplied to the temperature limited heater.

In certain embodiments modulated DC for example chopped DC waveform modulated DC or cycled DC may be used for providing electrical power to the temperature limited heater. A DC modulator or DC chopper may be coupled to a DC power supply to provide an output of modulated direct current. In some embodiments the DC power supply may include means for modulating DC. One example of a DC modulator is a DC to DC converter system. DC to DC converter systems are generally known in the art. DC is typically modulated or chopped into a desired waveform. Waveforms for DC modulation include but are not limited to square wave sinusoidal deformed sinusoidal deformed square wave triangular and other regular or irregular waveforms.

The modulated DC waveform generally defines the frequency of the modulated DC. Thus the modulated DC waveform may be selected to provide a desired modulated DC frequency. The shape and or the rate of modulation such as the rate of chopping of the modulated DC waveform may be varied to vary the modulated DC frequency. DC may be modulated at frequencies that are higher than generally available AC frequencies. For example modulated DC may be provided at frequencies of at least 1000 Hz. Increasing the frequency of supplied current to higher values advantageously increases the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater.

In certain embodiments the modulated DC waveform is adjusted or altered to vary the modulated DC frequency. The DC modulator may be able to adjust or alter the modulated DC waveform at any time during use of the temperature limited heater and at high currents or voltages. Thus modulated DC provided to the temperature limited heater is not limited to a single frequency or even a small set of frequency values. Waveform selection using the DC modulator typically allows for a wide range of modulated DC frequencies and for discrete control of the modulated DC frequency. Thus the modulated DC frequency is more easily set at a distinct value whereas AC frequency is generally limited to multiples of the line frequency. Discrete control of the modulated DC frequency allows for more selective control over the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater. Being able to selectively control the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater allows for a broader range of materials to be used in designing and constructing the temperature limited heater.

In some embodiments the modulated DC frequency or the AC frequency is adjusted to compensate for changes in properties for example subsurface conditions such as temperature or pressure of the temperature limited heater during use. The modulated DC frequency or the AC frequency provided to the temperature limited heater is varied based on assessed downhole conditions. For example as the temperature of the temperature limited heater in the wellbore increases it may be advantageous to increase the frequency of the current provided to the heater thus increasing the turndown ratio of the heater. In an embodiment the downhole temperature of the temperature limited heater in the wellbore is assessed.

In certain embodiments the modulated DC frequency or the AC frequency is varied to adjust the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater. The turndown ratio may be adjusted to compensate for hot spots occurring along a length of the temperature limited heater. For example the turndown ratio is increased because the temperature limited heater is getting too hot in certain locations. In some embodiments the modulated DC frequency or the AC frequency are varied to adjust a turndown ratio without assessing a subsurface condition.

At or near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic material a relatively small change in voltage may cause a relatively large change in current to the load. The relatively small change in voltage may produce problems in the power supplied to the temperature limited heater especially at or near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range. The problems include but are not limited to reducing the power factor tripping a circuit breaker and or blowing a fuse. In some cases voltage changes may be caused by a change in the load of the temperature limited heater. In certain embodiments an electrical current supply for example a supply of modulated DC or AC provides a relatively constant amount of current that does not substantially vary with changes in load of the temperature limited heater. In an embodiment the electrical current supply provides an amount of electrical current that remains within 15 within 10 within 5 or within 2 of a selected constant current value when a load of the temperature limited heater changes.

Temperature limited heaters may generate an inductive load. The inductive load is due to some applied electrical current being used by the ferromagnetic material to generate a magnetic field in addition to generating a resistive heat output. As downhole temperature changes in the temperature limited heater the inductive load of the heater changes due to changes in the ferromagnetic properties of ferromagnetic materials in the heater with temperature. The inductive load of the temperature limited heater may cause a phase shift between the current and the voltage applied to the heater.

A reduction in actual power applied to the temperature limited heater may be caused by a time lag in the current waveform for example the current has a phase shift relative to the voltage due to an inductive load and or by distortions in the current waveform for example distortions in the current waveform caused by introduced harmonics due to a non linear load . Thus it may take more current to apply a selected amount of power due to phase shifting or waveform distortion. The ratio of actual power applied and the apparent power that would have been transmitted if the same current were in phase and undistorted is the power factor. The power factor is always less than or equal to 1. The power factor is 1 when there is no phase shift or distortion in the waveform.

Actual power applied to a heater due to a phase shift may be described by EQN. 3 cos EQN. 3 in which P is the actual power applied to a heater I is the applied current V is the applied voltage and is the phase angle difference between voltage and current. Other phenomena such as waveform distortion may contribute to further lowering of the power factor. If there is no distortion in the waveform then cos is equal to the power factor.

In certain embodiments the temperature limited heater includes an inner conductor inside an outer conductor. The inner conductor and the outer conductor are radially disposed about a central axis. The inner and outer conductors may be separated by an insulation layer. In certain embodiments the inner and outer conductors are coupled at the bottom of the temperature limited heater. Electrical current may flow into the temperature limited heater through the inner conductor and return through the outer conductor. One or both conductors may include ferromagnetic material.

The insulation layer may comprise an electrically insulating ceramic with high thermal conductivity such as magnesium oxide aluminum oxide silicon dioxide beryllium oxide boron nitride silicon nitride or combinations thereof. The insulating layer may be a compacted powder for example compacted ceramic powder . Compaction may improve thermal conductivity and provide better insulation resistance. For lower temperature applications polymer insulation made from for example fluoropolymers polyimides polyamides and or polyethylenes may be used. In some embodiments the polymer insulation is made of perfluoroalkoxy PFA or polyetheretherketone PEEK Victrex Ltd England . The insulating layer may be chosen to be substantially infrared transparent to aid heat transfer from the inner conductor to the outer conductor. In an embodiment the insulating layer is transparent quartz sand. The insulation layer may be air or a non reactive gas such as helium nitrogen or sulfur hexafluoride. If the insulation layer is air or a non reactive gas there may be insulating spacers designed to inhibit electrical contact between the inner conductor and the outer conductor. The insulating spacers may be made of for example high purity aluminum oxide or another thermally conducting electrically insulating material such as silicon nitride. The insulating spacers may be a fibrous ceramic material such as Nextel 312 3M Corporation St. Paul Minn. U.S.A. mica tape or glass fiber. Ceramic material may be made of alumina alumina silicate alumina borosilicate silicon nitride boron nitride or other materials.

The insulation layer may be flexible and or substantially deformation tolerant. For example if the insulation layer is a solid or compacted material that substantially fills the space between the inner and outer conductors the temperature limited heater may be flexible and or substantially deformation tolerant. Forces on the outer conductor can be transmitted through the insulation layer to the solid inner conductor which may resist crushing. Such a temperature limited heater may be bent dog legged and spiraled without causing the outer conductor and the inner conductor to electrically short to each other. Deformation tolerance may be important if the wellbore is likely to undergo substantial deformation during heating of the formation.

In certain embodiments an outermost layer of the temperature limited heater for example the outer conductor is chosen for corrosion resistance yield strength and or creep resistance. In one embodiment austenitic non ferromagnetic stainless steels such as 201 304H 347H 347HH 316H 310H 347HP NF709 Nippon Steel Corp. Japan stainless steels or combinations thereof may be used in the outer conductor. The outermost layer may also include a clad conductor. For example a corrosion resistant alloy such as 800H or 347H stainless steel may be clad for corrosion protection over a ferromagnetic carbon steel tubular. If high temperature strength is not required the outermost layer may be constructed from ferromagnetic metal with good corrosion resistance such as one of the ferritic stainless steels. In one embodiment a ferritic alloy of 82.3 by weight iron with 17.7 by weight chromium Curie temperature of 678 C. provides desired corrosion resistance.

The Metals Handbook vol. 8 page 291 American Society of Materials ASM includes a graph of Curie temperature of iron chromium alloys versus the amount of chromium in the alloys. In some temperature limited heater embodiments a separate support rod or tubular made from 347H stainless steel is coupled to the temperature limited heater made from an iron chromium alloy to provide yield strength and or creep resistance. In certain embodiments the support material and or the ferromagnetic material is selected to provide a 100 000 hour creep rupture strength of at least 20.7 MPa at 650 C. In some embodiments the 100 000 hour creep rupture strength is at least 13.8 MPa at 650 C. or at least 6.9 MPa at 650 C. For example 347H steel has a favorable creep rupture strength at or above 650 C. In some embodiments the 100 000 hour creep rupture strength ranges from 6.9 MPa to 41.3 MPa or more for longer heaters and or higher earth or fluid stresses.

In temperature limited heater embodiments with both an inner ferromagnetic conductor and an outer ferromagnetic conductor the skin effect current path occurs on the outside of the inner conductor and on the inside of the outer conductor. Thus the outside of the outer conductor may be clad with the corrosion resistant alloy such as stainless steel without affecting the skin effect current path on the inside of the outer conductor.

A ferromagnetic conductor with a thickness of at least the skin depth at the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range allows a substantial decrease in resistance of the ferromagnetic material as the skin depth increases sharply near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range. In certain embodiments when the ferromagnetic conductor is not clad with a highly conducting material such as copper the thickness of the conductor may be 1.5 times the skin depth near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range 3 times the skin depth near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range or even 10 or more times the skin depth near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range. If the ferromagnetic conductor is clad with copper thickness of the ferromagnetic conductor may be substantially the same as the skin depth near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range. In some embodiments the ferromagnetic conductor clad with copper has a thickness of at least three fourths of the skin depth near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range.

In certain embodiments the temperature limited heater includes a composite conductor with a ferromagnetic tubular and a non ferromagnetic high electrical conductivity core. The non ferromagnetic high electrical conductivity core reduces a required diameter of the conductor. For example the conductor may be composite 1.19 cm diameter conductor with a core of 0.575 cm diameter copper clad with a 0.298 cm thickness of ferritic stainless steel or carbon steel surrounding the core. The core or non ferromagnetic conductor may be copper or copper alloy. The core or non ferromagnetic conductor may also be made of other metals that exhibit low electrical resistivity and relative magnetic permeabilities near 1 for example substantially non ferromagnetic materials such as aluminum and aluminum alloys phosphor bronze beryllium copper and or brass . A composite conductor allows the electrical resistance of the temperature limited heater to decrease more steeply near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range. As the skin depth increases near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range to include the copper core the electrical resistance decreases very sharply.

The composite conductor may increase the conductivity of the temperature limited heater and or allow the heater to operate at lower voltages. In an embodiment the composite conductor exhibits a relatively flat resistance versus temperature profile at temperatures below a region near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor of the composite conductor. In some embodiments the temperature limited heater exhibits a relatively flat resistance versus temperature profile between 100 C. and 750 C. or between 300 C. and 600 C. The relatively flat resistance versus temperature profile may also be exhibited in other temperature ranges by adjusting for example materials and or the configuration of materials in the temperature limited heater. In certain embodiments the relative thickness of each material in the composite conductor is selected to produce a desired resistivity versus temperature profile for the temperature limited heater.

In certain embodiments the relative thickness of each material in a composite conductor is selected to produce a desired resistivity versus temperature profile for a temperature limited heater. In an embodiment the composite conductor is an inner conductor surrounded by 0.127 cm thick magnesium oxide powder as an insulator. The outer conductor may be 304H stainless steel with a wall thickness of 0.127 cm. The outside diameter of the heater may be about 1.65 cm.

A composite conductor for example a composite inner conductor or a composite outer conductor may be manufactured by methods including but not limited to coextrusion roll forming tight fit tubing for example cooling the inner member and heating the outer member then inserting the inner member in the outer member followed by a drawing operation and or allowing the system to cool explosive or electromagnetic cladding arc overlay welding longitudinal strip welding plasma powder welding billet coextrusion electroplating drawing sputtering plasma deposition coextrusion casting magnetic forming molten cylinder casting of inner core material inside the outer or vice versa insertion followed by welding or high temperature braising shielded active gas welding SAG and or insertion of an inner pipe in an outer pipe followed by mechanical expansion of the inner pipe by hydroforming or use of a pig to expand and swage the inner pipe against the outer pipe. In some embodiments a ferromagnetic conductor is braided over a non ferromagnetic conductor. In certain embodiments composite conductors are formed using methods similar to those used for cladding for example cladding copper to steel . A metallurgical bond between copper cladding and base ferromagnetic material may be advantageous. Composite conductors produced by a coextrusion process that forms a good metallurgical bond for example a good bond between copper and 446 stainless steel may be provided by Anomet Products Inc. Shrewsbury Mass. U.S.A. .

The temperature limited heaters may be used in conductor in conduit heaters. In some embodiments of conductor in conduit heaters the majority of the resistive heat is generated in the conductor and the heat radiatively conductively and or convectively transfers to the conduit. In some embodiments of conductor in conduit heaters the majority of the resistive heat is generated in the conduit.

In some embodiments the conductor for example an inner conductor an outer conductor or a ferromagnetic conductor is the composite conductor that includes two or more different materials. In certain embodiments the composite conductor includes two or more ferromagnetic materials. In some embodiments the composite ferromagnetic conductor includes two or more radially disposed materials. In certain embodiments the composite conductor includes a ferromagnetic conductor and a non ferromagnetic conductor. In some embodiments the composite conductor includes the ferromagnetic conductor placed over a non ferromagnetic core. Two or more materials may be used to obtain a relatively flat electrical resistivity versus temperature profile in a temperature region below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range and or a sharp decrease a high turndown ratio in the electrical resistivity at or near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range. In some cases two or more materials are used to provide more than one Curie temperature and or phase transformation temperature range for the temperature limited heater.

The composite electrical conductor may be used as the conductor in any electrical heater embodiment described herein. For example the composite conductor may be used as the conductor in a conductor in conduit heater or an insulated conductor heater. In certain embodiments the composite conductor may be coupled to a support member such as a support conductor. The support member may be used to provide support to the composite conductor so that the composite conductor is not relied upon for strength at or near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range. The support member may be useful for heaters of lengths of at least 100 m. The support member may be a non ferromagnetic member that has good high temperature creep strength. Examples of materials that are used for a support member include but are not limited to Haynes 625 alloy and Haynes HR120 alloy Haynes International Kokomo Ind. U.S.A. NF709 Incoloy 800H alloy and 347HP alloy Allegheny Ludlum Corp. Pittsburgh Pa. U.S.A. . In some embodiments materials in a composite conductor are directly coupled for example brazed metallurgically bonded or swaged to each other and or the support member. Using a support member may reduce the need for the ferromagnetic member to provide support for the temperature limited heater especially at or near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range. Thus the temperature limited heater may be designed with more flexibility in the selection of ferromagnetic materials.

In certain embodiments the diameter of core is adjusted relative to a constant outside diameter of ferromagnetic conductor to adjust the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater. For example the diameter of core may be increased to 1.14 cm while maintaining the outside diameter of ferromagnetic conductor at 1.9 cm to increase the turndown ratio of the heater.

In some embodiments conductors for example core and ferromagnetic conductor in the composite conductor are separated by support member . depicts a cross sectional representation of an embodiment of the composite conductor with support member separating the conductors. In one embodiment core is copper with a diameter of 0.95 cm support member is 347H alloy with an outside diameter of 1.9 cm and ferromagnetic conductor is 446 stainless steel with an outside diameter of 2.7 cm. The support member depicted in has a lower creep strength relative to the support members depicted in .

In certain embodiments support member is located inside the composite conductor. depicts a cross sectional representation of an embodiment of the composite conductor surrounding support member . Support member is made of 347H alloy. Inner conductor is copper. Ferromagnetic conductor is 446 stainless steel. In one embodiment support member is 1.25 cm diameter 347H alloy inner conductor is 1.9 cm outside diameter copper and ferromagnetic conductor is 2.7 cm outside diameter 446 stainless steel. The turndown ratio is higher than the turndown ratio for the embodiments depicted in and for the same outside diameter but the creep strength is lower.

In some embodiments the thickness of inner conductor which is copper is reduced and the thickness of support member is increased to increase the creep strength at the expense of reduced turndown ratio. For example the diameter of support member is increased to 1.6 cm while maintaining the outside diameter of inner conductor at 1.9 cm to reduce the thickness of the conduit. This reduction in thickness of inner conductor results in a decreased turndown ratio relative to the thicker inner conductor embodiment but an increased creep strength.

In one embodiment support member is a conduit or pipe inside inner conductor and ferromagnetic conductor . depicts a cross sectional representation of an embodiment of the composite conductor surrounding support member . In one embodiment support member is 347H alloy with a 0.63 cm diameter center hole. In some embodiments support member is a preformed conduit. In certain embodiments support member is formed by having a dissolvable material for example copper dissolvable by nitric acid located inside the support member during formation of the composite conductor. The dissolvable material is dissolved to form the hole after the conductor is assembled. In an embodiment support member is 347H alloy with an inside diameter of 0.63 cm and an outside diameter of 1.6 cm inner conductor is copper with an outside diameter of 1.8 cm and ferromagnetic conductor is 446 stainless steel with an outside diameter of 2.7 cm.

In certain embodiments the composite electrical conductor is used as the conductor in the conductor in conduit heater. For example the composite electrical conductor may be used as conductor in .

Conduit is made of an electrically conductive material. Conduit is disposed in opening in hydrocarbon layer . Opening has a diameter that accommodates conduit .

Conductor may be centered in conduit by centralizers . Centralizers electrically isolate conductor from conduit . Centralizers inhibit movement and properly locate conductor in conduit . Centralizers are made of ceramic material or a combination of ceramic and metallic materials. Centralizers inhibit deformation of conductor in conduit . Centralizers are touching or spaced at intervals between approximately 0.1 m meters and approximately 3 m or more along conductor .

A second low resistance section of conductor may couple conductor to wellhead . Electrical current may be applied to conductor from power cable through low resistance section of conductor . Electrical current passes from conductor through sliding connector to conduit . Conduit may be electrically insulated from overburden casing and from wellhead to return electrical current to power cable . Heat may be generated in conductor and conduit . The generated heat may radiate in conduit and opening to heat at least a portion of hydrocarbon layer .

Overburden casing may be disposed in overburden . Overburden casing is in some embodiments surrounded by materials for example reinforcing material and or cement that inhibit heating of overburden . Low resistance section of conductor may be placed in overburden casing . Low resistance section of conductor is made of for example carbon steel. Low resistance section of conductor may be centralized in overburden casing using centralizers . Centralizers are spaced at intervals of approximately 6 m to approximately 12 m or for example approximately 9 m along low resistance section of conductor . In a heater embodiment low resistance section of conductor is coupled to conductor by one or more welds. In other heater embodiments low resistance sections are threaded threaded and welded or otherwise coupled to the conductor. Low resistance section generates little or no heat in overburden casing . Packing may be placed between overburden casing and opening . Packing may be used as a cap at the junction of overburden and hydrocarbon layer to allow filling of materials in the annulus between overburden casing and opening . In some embodiments packing inhibits fluid from flowing from opening to surface .

For a temperature limited heater in which the ferromagnetic conductor provides a majority of the resistive heat output below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range a majority of the current flows through material with highly non linear functions of magnetic field H versus magnetic induction B . These non linear functions may cause strong inductive effects and distortion that lead to decreased power factor in the temperature limited heater at temperatures below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range. These effects may render the electrical power supply to the temperature limited heater difficult to control and may result in additional current flow through surface and or overburden power supply conductors. Expensive and or difficult to implement control systems such as variable capacitors or modulated power supplies may be used to compensate for these effects and to control temperature limited heaters where the majority of the resistive heat output is provided by current flow through the ferromagnetic material.

In certain temperature limited heater embodiments the ferromagnetic conductor confines a majority of the flow of electrical current to an electrical conductor coupled to the ferromagnetic conductor when the temperature limited heater is below or near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor. The electrical conductor may be a sheath jacket support member corrosion resistant member or other electrically resistive member. In some embodiments the ferromagnetic conductor confines a majority of the flow of electrical current to the electrical conductor positioned between an outermost layer and the ferromagnetic conductor. The ferromagnetic conductor is located in the cross section of the temperature limited heater such that the magnetic properties of the ferromagnetic conductor at or below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor confine the majority of the flow of electrical current to the electrical conductor. The majority of the flow of electrical current is confined to the electrical conductor due to the skin effect of the ferromagnetic conductor. Thus the majority of the current is flowing through material with substantially linear resistive properties throughout most of the operating range of the heater.

In certain embodiments the ferromagnetic conductor and the electrical conductor are located in the cross section of the temperature limited heater so that the skin effect of the ferromagnetic material limits the penetration depth of electrical current in the electrical conductor and the ferromagnetic conductor at temperatures below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor. Thus the electrical conductor provides a majority of the electrically resistive heat output of the temperature limited heater at temperatures up to a temperature at or near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor. In certain embodiments the dimensions of the electrical conductor may be chosen to provide desired heat output characteristics.

Because the majority of the current flows through the electrical conductor below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range the temperature limited heater has a resistance versus temperature profile that at least partially reflects the resistance versus temperature profile of the material in the electrical conductor. Thus the resistance versus temperature profile of the temperature limited heater is substantially linear below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor if the material in the electrical conductor has a substantially linear resistance versus temperature profile. For example the temperature limited heater in which the majority of the current flows in the electrical conductor below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range may have a resistance versus temperature profile similar to the profile shown in . The resistance of the temperature limited heater has little or no dependence on the current flowing through the heater until the temperature nears the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range. The majority of the current flows in the electrical conductor rather than the ferromagnetic conductor below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range.

Resistance versus temperature profiles for temperature limited heaters in which the majority of the current flows in the electrical conductor also tend to exhibit sharper reductions in resistance near or at the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor. For example the reduction in resistance shown in is sharper than the reduction in resistance shown in . The sharper reductions in resistance near or at the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range are easier to control than more gradual resistance reductions near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range because little current is flowing through the ferromagnetic material.

In certain embodiments the material and or the dimensions of the material in the electrical conductor are selected so that the temperature limited heater has a desired resistance versus temperature profile below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor.

Temperature limited heaters in which the majority of the current flows in the electrical conductor rather than the ferromagnetic conductor below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range are easier to predict and or control. Behavior of temperature limited heaters in which the majority of the current flows in the electrical conductor rather than the ferromagnetic conductor below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range may be predicted by for example the resistance versus temperature profile and or the power factor versus temperature profile. Resistance versus temperature profiles and or power factor versus temperature profiles may be assessed or predicted by for example experimental measurements that assess the behavior of the temperature limited heater analytical equations that assess or predict the behavior of the temperature limited heater and or simulations that assess or predict the behavior of the temperature limited heater.

In certain embodiments assessed or predicted behavior of the temperature limited heater is used to control the temperature limited heater. The temperature limited heater may be controlled based on measurements assessments of the resistance and or the power factor during operation of the heater. In some embodiments the power or current supplied to the temperature limited heater is controlled based on assessment of the resistance and or the power factor of the heater during operation of the heater and the comparison of this assessment versus the predicted behavior of the heater. In certain embodiments the temperature limited heater is controlled without measurement of the temperature of the heater or a temperature near the heater. Controlling the temperature limited heater without temperature measurement eliminates operating costs associated with downhole temperature measurement. Controlling the temperature limited heater based on assessment of the resistance and or the power factor of the heater also reduces the time for making adjustments in the power or current supplied to the heater compared to controlling the heater based on measured temperature.

As the temperature of the temperature limited heater approaches or exceeds the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor reduction in the ferromagnetic properties of the ferromagnetic conductor allows electrical current to flow through a greater portion of the electrically conducting cross section of the temperature limited heater. Thus the electrical resistance of the temperature limited heater is reduced and the temperature limited heater automatically provides reduced heat output at or near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor. In certain embodiments a highly electrically conductive member is coupled to the ferromagnetic conductor and the electrical conductor to reduce the electrical resistance of the temperature limited heater at or above the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor. The highly electrically conductive member may be an inner conductor a core or another conductive member of copper aluminum nickel or alloys thereof.

The ferromagnetic conductor that confines the majority of the flow of electrical current to the electrical conductor at temperatures below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range may have a relatively small cross section compared to the ferromagnetic conductor in temperature limited heaters that use the ferromagnetic conductor to provide the majority of resistive heat output up to or near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range. A temperature limited heater that uses the electrical conductor to provide a majority of the resistive heat output below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range has low magnetic inductance at temperatures below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range because less current is flowing through the ferromagnetic conductor as compared to the temperature limited heater where the majority of the resistive heat output below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range is provided by the ferromagnetic material. Magnetic field H at radius r of the ferromagnetic conductor is proportional to the current I flowing through the ferromagnetic conductor and the core divided by the radius or EQN. 4 Since only a portion of the current flows through the ferromagnetic conductor for a temperature limited heater that uses the outer conductor to provide a majority of the resistive heat output below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range the magnetic field of the temperature limited heater may be significantly smaller than the magnetic field of the temperature limited heater where the majority of the current flows through the ferromagnetic material. The relative magnetic permeability may be large for small magnetic fields.

The skin depth of the ferromagnetic conductor is inversely proportional to the square root of the relative magnetic permeability 1 . EQN. 5 Increasing the relative magnetic permeability decreases the skin depth of the ferromagnetic conductor. However because only a portion of the current flows through the ferromagnetic conductor for temperatures below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range the radius or thickness of the ferromagnetic conductor may be decreased for ferromagnetic materials with large relative magnetic permeabilities to compensate for the decreased skin depth while still allowing the skin effect to limit the penetration depth of the electrical current to the electrical conductor at temperatures below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor. The radius thickness of the ferromagnetic conductor may be between 0.3 mm and 8 mm between 0.3 mm and 2 mm or between 2 mm and 4 mm depending on the relative magnetic permeability of the ferromagnetic conductor. Decreasing the thickness of the ferromagnetic conductor decreases costs of manufacturing the temperature limited heater as the cost of ferromagnetic material tends to be a significant portion of the cost of the temperature limited heater. Increasing the relative magnetic permeability of the ferromagnetic conductor provides a higher turndown ratio and a sharper decrease in electrical resistance for the temperature limited heater at or near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor.

Ferromagnetic materials such as purified iron or iron cobalt alloys with high relative magnetic permeabilities for example at least 200 at least 1000 at least 1 10 or at least 1 10 and or high Curie temperatures for example at least 600 C. at least 700 C. or at least 800 C. tend to have less corrosion resistance and or less mechanical strength at high temperatures. The electrical conductor may provide corrosion resistance and or high mechanical strength at high temperatures for the temperature limited heater. Thus the ferromagnetic conductor may be chosen primarily for its ferromagnetic properties.

Confining the majority of the flow of electrical current to the electrical conductor below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor reduces variations in the power factor. Because only a portion of the electrical current flows through the ferromagnetic conductor below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range the non linear ferromagnetic properties of the ferromagnetic conductor have little or no effect on the power factor of the temperature limited heater except at or near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range. Even at or near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range the effect on the power factor is reduced compared to temperature limited heaters in which the ferromagnetic conductor provides a majority of the resistive heat output below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range. Thus there is less or no need for external compensation for example variable capacitors or waveform modification to adjust for changes in the inductive load of the temperature limited heater to maintain a relatively high power factor.

In certain embodiments the temperature limited heater which confines the majority of the flow of electrical current to the electrical conductor below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor maintains the power factor above 0.85 above 0.9 or above 0.95 during use of the heater. Any reduction in the power factor occurs only in sections of the temperature limited heater at temperatures near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range. Most sections of the temperature limited heater are typically not at or near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range during use. These sections have a high power factor that approaches 1.0. The power factor for the entire temperature limited heater is maintained above 0.85 above 0.9 or above 0.95 during use of the heater even if some sections of the heater have power factors below 0.85.

Maintaining high power factors allows for less expensive power supplies and or control devices such as solid state power supplies or SCRs silicon controlled rectifiers . These devices may fail to operate properly if the power factor varies by too large an amount because of inductive loads. With the power factors maintained at high values however these devices may be used to provide power to the temperature limited heater. Solid state power supplies have the advantage of allowing fine tuning and controlled adjustment of the power supplied to the temperature limited heater.

In some embodiments transformers are used to provide power to the temperature limited heater. Multiple voltage taps may be made into the transformer to provide power to the temperature limited heater. Multiple voltage taps allow the current supplied to switch back and forth between the multiple voltages. This maintains the current within a range bound by the multiple voltage taps.

The highly electrically conductive member or inner conductor increases the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater. In certain embodiments thickness of the highly electrically conductive member is increased to increase the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater. In some embodiments the thickness of the electrical conductor is reduced to increase the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater. In certain embodiments the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater is between 1.1 and 10 between 2 and 8 or between 3 and 6 for example the turndown ratio is at least 1.1 at least 2 or at least 3 .

In certain embodiments electrical conductor provides support for ferromagnetic conductor and the temperature limited heater. Electrical conductor may be made of a material that provides good mechanical strength at temperatures near or above the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of ferromagnetic conductor . In certain embodiments electrical conductor is a corrosion resistant member. Electrical conductor support member may provide support for ferromagnetic conductor and corrosion resistance. Electrical conductor is made from a material that provides desired electrically resistive heat output at temperatures up to and or above the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of ferromagnetic conductor .

In an embodiment electrical conductor is 347H stainless steel. In some embodiments electrical conductor is another electrically conductive good mechanical strength corrosion resistant material. For example electrical conductor may be 304H 316H 347HH NF709 Incoloy 800H alloy Inco Alloys International Huntington W. Va. U.S.A. Haynes HR120 alloy or Inconel 617 alloy.

In some embodiments electrical conductor support member includes different alloys in different portions of the temperature limited heater. For example a lower portion of electrical conductor support member is 347H stainless steel and an upper portion of the electrical conductor support member is NF709. In certain embodiments different alloys are used in different portions of the electrical conductor support member to increase the mechanical strength of the electrical conductor support member while maintaining desired heating properties for the temperature limited heater.

In some embodiments ferromagnetic conductor includes different ferromagnetic conductors in different portions of the temperature limited heater. Different ferromagnetic conductors may be used in different portions of the temperature limited heater to vary the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range and thus the maximum operating temperature in the different portions. In some embodiments the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range in an upper portion of the temperature limited heater is lower than the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range in a lower portion of the heater. The lower Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range in the upper portion increases the creep rupture strength lifetime in the upper portion of the heater.

In the embodiment depicted in ferromagnetic conductor electrical conductor and core are dimensioned so that the skin depth of the ferromagnetic conductor limits the penetration depth of the majority of the flow of electrical current to the support member when the temperature is below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor. Thus electrical conductor provides a majority of the electrically resistive heat output of the temperature limited heater at temperatures up to a temperature at or near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of ferromagnetic conductor . In certain embodiments the temperature limited heater depicted in is smaller for example an outside diameter of 3 cm 2.9 cm 2.5 cm or less than other temperature limited heaters that do not use electrical conductor to provide the majority of electrically resistive heat output. The temperature limited heater depicted in may be smaller because ferromagnetic conductor is thin as compared to the size of the ferromagnetic conductor needed for a temperature limited heater in which the majority of the resistive heat output is provided by the ferromagnetic conductor.

In some embodiments the support member and the corrosion resistant member are different members in the temperature limited heater. depict embodiments of temperature limited heaters in which the jacket provides a majority of the heat output below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor. In these embodiments electrical conductor is jacket . Electrical conductor ferromagnetic conductor support member and core in or inner conductor in are dimensioned so that the skin depth of the ferromagnetic conductor limits the penetration depth of the majority of the flow of electrical current to the thickness of the jacket. In certain embodiments electrical conductor is a material that is corrosion resistant and provides electrically resistive heat output below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of ferromagnetic conductor . For example electrical conductor is 825 stainless steel or 347H stainless steel. In some embodiments electrical conductor has a small thickness for example on the order of 0.5 mm .

In core is highly electrically conductive material such as copper or aluminum. Support member is 347H stainless steel or another material with good mechanical strength at or near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of ferromagnetic conductor .

In support member is the core of the temperature limited heater and is 347H stainless steel or another material with good mechanical strength at or near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of ferromagnetic conductor . Inner conductor is highly electrically conductive material such as copper or aluminum.

In some embodiments a relatively thin conductive layer is used to provide the majority of the electrically resistive heat output of the temperature limited heater at temperatures up to a temperature at or near the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of the ferromagnetic conductor. Such a temperature limited heater may be used as the heating member in an insulated conductor heater. The heating member of the insulated conductor heater may be located inside a sheath with an insulation layer between the sheath and the heating member.

Inner conductor is a relatively thin conductive layer of non ferromagnetic material with a higher electrical conductivity than ferromagnetic conductor . In certain embodiments inner conductor is copper. Inner conductor may be a copper alloy. Copper alloys typically have a flatter resistance versus temperature profile than pure copper. A flatter resistance versus temperature profile may provide less variation in the heat output as a function of temperature up to the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range. In some embodiments inner conductor is copper with 6 by weight nickel for example CuNi6 or LOHM . In some embodiments inner conductor is CuNi10Fe1Mn alloy. Below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of ferromagnetic conductor the magnetic properties of the ferromagnetic conductor confine the majority of the flow of electrical current to inner conductor . Thus inner conductor provides the majority of the resistive heat output of insulated conductor below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range.

In certain embodiments inner conductor is dimensioned along with core and ferromagnetic conductor so that the inner conductor provides a desired amount of heat output and a desired turndown ratio. For example inner conductor may have a cross sectional area that is around 2 or 3 times less than the cross sectional area of core . Typically inner conductor has to have a relatively small cross sectional area to provide a desired heat output if the inner conductor is copper or copper alloy. In an embodiment with copper inner conductor core has a diameter of 0.66 cm ferromagnetic conductor has an outside diameter of 0.91 cm inner conductor has an outside diameter of 1.03 cm electrical insulator has an outside diameter of 1.53 cm and jacket has an outside diameter of 1.79 cm. In an embodiment with a CuNi6 inner conductor core has a diameter of 0.66 cm ferromagnetic conductor has an outside diameter of 0.91 cm inner conductor has an outside diameter of 1.12 cm electrical insulator has an outside diameter of 1.63 cm and jacket has an outside diameter of 1.88 cm. Such insulated conductors are typically smaller and cheaper to manufacture than insulated conductors that do not use the thin inner conductor to provide the majority of heat output below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range.

Electrical insulator may be magnesium oxide aluminum oxide silicon dioxide beryllium oxide boron nitride silicon nitride or combinations thereof. In certain embodiments electrical insulator is a compacted powder of magnesium oxide. In some embodiments electrical insulator includes beads of silicon nitride.

In certain embodiments a small layer of material is placed between electrical insulator and inner conductor to inhibit copper from migrating into the electrical insulator at higher temperatures. For example a small layer of nickel for example about 0.5 mm of nickel may be placed between electrical insulator and inner conductor .

Jacket is made of a corrosion resistant material such as but not limited to 347 stainless steel 347H stainless steel 446 stainless steel or 825 stainless steel. In some embodiments jacket provides some mechanical strength for insulated conductor at or above the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range of ferromagnetic conductor . In certain embodiments jacket is not used to conduct electrical current.

For long vertical temperature limited heaters for example heaters at least 300 m at least 500 m or at least 1 km in length the hanging stress becomes important in the selection of materials for the temperature limited heater. Without the proper selection of material the support member may not have sufficient mechanical strength for example creep rupture strength to support the weight of the temperature limited heater at the operating temperatures of the heater.

In certain embodiments materials for the support member are varied to increase the maximum allowable hanging stress at operating temperatures of the temperature limited heater and thus increase the maximum operating temperature of the temperature limited heater. Altering the materials of the support member affects the heat output of the temperature limited heater below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range because changing the materials changes the resistance versus temperature profile of the support member. In certain embodiments the support member is made of more than one material along the length of the heater so that the temperature limited heater maintains desired operating properties for example resistance versus temperature profile below the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range as much as possible while providing sufficient mechanical properties to support the heater. In some embodiments transition sections are used between sections of the heater to provide strength that compensates for the difference in temperature between sections of the heater. In certain embodiments one or more portions of the temperature limited heater have varying outside diameters and or materials to provide desired properties for the heater.

In certain embodiments of temperature limited heaters three temperature limited heaters are coupled together in a three phase wye configuration. Coupling three temperature limited heaters together in the three phase wye configuration lowers the current in each of the individual temperature limited heaters because the current is split between the three individual heaters. Lowering the current in each individual temperature limited heater allows each heater to have a small diameter. The lower currents allow for higher relative magnetic permeabilities in each of the individual temperature limited heaters and thus higher turndown ratios. In addition there may be no return current needed for each of the individual temperature limited heaters. Thus the turndown ratio remains higher for each of the individual temperature limited heaters than if each temperature limited heater had its own return current path.

In the three phase wye configuration individual temperature limited heaters may be coupled together by shorting the sheaths jackets or canisters of each of the individual temperature limited heaters to the electrically conductive sections the conductors providing heat at their terminating ends for example the ends of the heaters at the bottom of a heater wellbore . In some embodiments the sheaths jackets canisters and or electrically conductive sections are coupled to a support member that supports the temperature limited heaters in the wellbore.

In certain embodiments coupling multiple heaters for example insulated conductor or mineral insulated conductor heaters to a single power source such as a transformer is advantageous. Coupling multiple heaters to a single transformer may result in using fewer transformers to power heaters used for a treatment area as compared to using individual transformers for each heater. Using fewer transformers reduces surface congestion and allows easier access to the heaters and surface components. Using fewer transformers reduces capital costs associated with providing power to the treatment area. In some embodiments at least 4 at least 5 at least 10 at least 25 heaters at least 35 heaters or at least 45 heaters are powered by a single transformer. Additionally powering multiple heaters in different heater wells from the single transformer may reduce overburden losses because of reduced voltage and or phase differences between each of the heater wells powered by the single transformer. Powering multiple heaters from the single transformer may inhibit current imbalances between the heaters because the heaters are coupled to the single transformer.

To provide power to multiple heaters using the single transformer the transformer may have to provide power at higher voltages to carry the current to each of the heaters effectively. In certain embodiments the heaters are floating ungrounded heaters in the formation. Floating the heaters allows the heaters to operate at higher voltages. In some embodiments the transformer provides power output of at least about 3 kV at least about 4 kV at least about 5 kV or at least about 6 kV.

In some embodiments core and or jacket include ferromagnetic materials. In some embodiments one or more insulated conductors are temperature limited heaters. In certain embodiments the overburden portion of insulated conductors include high electrical conductivity materials in core for example pure copper or copper alloys such as copper with 3 silicon at a weldjoint so that the overburden portions of the insulated conductors provide little or no heat output. In certain embodiments conduit includes non corrosive materials and or high strength materials such as stainless steel. In one embodiment conduit is 347H stainless steel.

Insulated conductors may be coupled to the single transformer in a three phase configuration for example a three phase wye configuration . Each insulated conductor may be coupled to one phase of the single transformer. In certain embodiments the single transformer is also coupled to a plurality of identical heaters in other heater wells in the formation for example the single transformer may couple to 40 or more heaters in the formation . In some embodiments the single transformer couples to at least 4 at least 5 at least 10 at least 15 or at least 25 additional heaters in the formation.

Electrical insulator may be located inside conduit to electrically insulate insulated conductors from the conduit. In certain embodiments electrical insulator is magnesium oxide for example compacted magnesium oxide . In some embodiments electrical insulator is silicon nitride for example silicon nitride blocks . Electrical insulator electrically insulates insulated conductors from conduit so that at high operating voltages for example 3 kV or higher there is no arcing between the conductors and the conduit. In some embodiments electrical insulator inside conduit has at least the thickness of electrical insulators in insulated conductors . The increased thickness of insulation in heater from electrical insulators and or electrical insulator inhibits and may prevent current leakage into the formation from the heater. In some embodiments electrical insulator spatially locates insulated conductors inside conduit .

Return conductor may be electrically coupled to the ends of insulated conductors as shown in current returns from the ends of the insulated conductors to the transformer on the surface of the formation. Return conductor may include high electrical conductivity materials such as pure copper nickel copper alloys or combinations thereof so that the return conductor provides little or no heat output. In some embodiments return conductor is a tubular for example a stainless steel tubular that allows an optical fiber to be placed inside the tubular to be used for temperature and or other measurement. In some embodiments return conductor is a small insulated conductor for example small mineral insulated conductor . Return conductor may be coupled to the neutral or ground leg of the transformer in a three phase wye configuration. Thus insulated conductors are electrically isolated from conduit and the formation. Using return conductor to return current to the surface may make coupling the heater to a wellhead easier. In some embodiments current is returned using one or more of jackets depicted in . One or more jackets may be coupled to cores at the end of the heaters and return current to the neutral of the three phase wye transformer.

In certain embodiments heater depicted in includes an overburden section using copper as the core of the insulated conductors. The copper in the overburden section may be the same diameter as the cores used in the heating section of the heater. The copper in the overburden section may have a larger diameter than the cores in the heating section of the heater. Increasing the size of the copper in the overburden section may decrease losses in the overburden section of the heater.

Heaters that include three insulated conductors in conduit as depicted in may be made in a multiple step process. In some embodiments the multiple step process is performed at the site of the formation or treatment area. In some embodiments the multiple step process is performed at a remote manufacturing site away from the formation. The finished heater is then transported to the treatment area.

Insulated conductors may be pre assembled prior to the bundling either on site or at a remote location. Insulated conductors and return conductor may be positioned on spools. A machine may draw insulated conductors and return conductor from the spools at a selected rate. Preformed blocks of insulation material may be positioned around return conductor and insulated conductors . In an embodiment two blocks are positioned around return conductor and three blocks are positioned around insulated conductors to form electrical insulator . The insulated conductors and return conductor may be drawn or pushed into a plate of conduit material that has been rolled into a tubular shape. The edges of the plate may be pressed together and welded for example by laser welding . After forming conduit around electrical insulator the bundle of insulated conductors and return conductor the conduit may be compacted against the electrical insulator so that all of the components of the heater are pressed together into a compact and tightly fitting form. During the compaction the electrical insulator may flow and fill any gaps inside the heater.

In some embodiments heater which includes conduit around electrical insulator and the bundle of insulated conductors and return conductor is inserted into a coiled tubing tubular that is placed in a wellbore in the formation. The coiled tubing tubular may be left in place in the formation left in during heating of the formation or removed from the formation after installation of the heater. The coiled tubing tubular may allow for easier installation of heater into the wellbore.

In some embodiments one or more components of heater are varied for example removed moved or replaced while the operation of the heater remains substantially identical. depicts an embodiment of heater with three insulated cores in conduit . In this embodiment electrical insulator surrounds cores and return conductor in conduit . Cores are located in conduit without an electrical insulator and jacket surrounding the cores. Cores are coupled to the single transformer in a three phase wye configuration with each core coupled to one phase of the transformer. Return conductor is electrically coupled to the ends of cores and returns current from the ends of the cores to the transformer on the surface of the formation.

Banding insulated conductors together instead of placing the conductors in a casing allows open spaces between the conductors to radiate heat to the formation thus increasing the radiating surface area of heater . Banding insulated conductors together may improve the insertion strength of heater .

In some embodiments insulated conductors are banded onto and around support member as shown in . Support member may provide structural support and or increase the insertion strength of heater . In some embodiments support member includes a conduit used to provide fluids and or to remove fluids from heater .

Heater may be provided power from single phase power sources as depicted in or three phase power sources as depicted in depending on desired operation of the heater. Support member may provide electrical isolation for insulated conductors coupled to the three phase power source. The voltage differentials on the surfaces jackets of insulated conductors in the three phase embodiment may be reduced because of the proximity effect.

In some embodiments optical sensor is located at or near a center of insulated conductors . Optical sensor may be used to assess properties of heater such as but not limited to stress temperature and or pressure. In some embodiments support member includes a notch as shown in for insertion of optical sensor . The notch may allow continuous insertion of optical sensor optical sensor during installation of heater .

Insulated conductor and conduit may be placed in an opening in a subsurface formation. Insulated conductor and conduit may have any orientation in a subsurface formation for example the insulated conductor and conduit may be substantially vertical or substantially horizontally oriented in the formation . Insulated conductor includes core electrical insulator and jacket . In some embodiments core is a copper core. In some embodiments core includes other electrical conductors or alloys for example copper alloys . In some embodiments core includes a ferromagnetic conductor so that insulated conductor operates as a temperature limited heater. In some embodiments core does not include a ferromagnetic conductor.

In some embodiments core of insulated conductor is made of two or more portions. The first portion may be placed adjacent to the overburden. The first portion may be sized and or made of a highly conductive material so that the first portion does not resistively heat to a high temperature. One or more other portions of core may be sized and or made of material that resistively heats to a high temperature. These portions of core may be positioned adjacent to sections of the formation that are to be heated by the heater. In some embodiments the insulated conductor does not include a highly conductive first portion. A lead in cable may be coupled to the insulated conductor to supply electricity to the insulated conductor.

In some embodiments core of insulated conductor is a highly conductive material such as copper. Core may be electrically coupled to jacket at or near the end of the insulated conductor. In some embodiments insulated conductor is electrically coupled to conduit . Electrical current supplied to insulated conductor may resistively heat core jacket material and or conduit . Resistive heating of core jacket material and or conduit generates heat that may transfer to the formation.

Electrical insulator may be magnesium oxide aluminum oxide silicon dioxide beryllium oxide boron nitride silicon nitride or combinations thereof. In certain embodiments electrical insulator is a compacted powder of magnesium oxide. In some embodiments electrical insulator includes beads of silicon nitride. In certain embodiments a thin layer of material clad over core to inhibit the core from migrating into the electrical insulator at higher temperatures i.e. to inhibit copper of the core from migrating into magnesium oxide of the insulation . For example a small layer of nickel for example about 0.5 mm of nickel may be clad on core .

In some embodiments material may be relatively corrosive. Jacket and or at least the inside surface of conduit may be made of a corrosion resistant material such as but not limited to nickel Alloy N Carpenter Metals 347 stainless steel 347H stainless steel 446 stainless steel or 825 stainless steel. For example conduit may be plated or lined with nickel. In some embodiments material may be relatively non corrosive. Jacket and or at least the inside surface of conduit may be made of a material such as carbon steel.

In some embodiments jacket of insulated conductor is not used as the main return of electrical current for the insulated conductor. In embodiments where material is a good electrical conductor such as a molten metal current returns through the molten metal in the conduit and or through the conduit . In some embodiments conduit is made of a ferromagnetic material for example 410 stainless steel . Conduit may function as a temperature limited heater until the temperature of the conduit approaches reaches or exceeds the Curie temperature or phase transition temperature of the conduit material.

In some embodiments material returns electrical current to the surface from insulated conductor i.e. the material acts as the return or ground conductor for the insulated conductor . Material may provide a current path with low resistance so that a long insulated conductor is useable in conduit . The long heater may operate at low voltages for the length of the heater due to the presence of material that is conductive.

In embodiments where material is partially electrically conductive for example the material is a molten salt current returns mainly through jacket . All or a portion of the current that passes through partially conductive material may pass to ground through conduit .

In the embodiment depicted in core of insulated conductor has a diameter of about 1 cm electrical insulator has an outside diameter of about 1.6 cm and jacket has an outside diameter of about 1.8 cm. In other embodiments the insulated conductor is smaller. For example core has a diameter of about 0.5 cm electrical insulator has an outside diameter of about 0.8 cm and jacket has an outside diameter of about 0.9 cm. Other insulated conductor geometries may be used. For the same size conduit the smaller geometry of insulated conductor may result in a higher operating temperature of the insulated conductor to achieve the same temperature at the conduit. The smaller geometry insulated conductors may be significantly more economically favorable due to manufacturing cost weight and other factors.

Material may be placed between the outside surface of insulated conductor and the inside surface of conduit . In certain embodiments material is placed in the conduit in a solid form as balls or pellets. Material may melt below the operating temperatures of insulated conductor . Material may melt above ambient subsurface formation temperatures. Material may be placed in conduit after insulated conductor is placed in the conduit. In certain embodiments material is placed in conduit as a liquid. The liquid may be placed in conduit before or after insulated conductor is placed in the conduit for example the molten liquid may be poured into the conduit before or after the insulated conductor is placed in the conduit . Additionally material may be placed in conduit before or after insulated conductor is energized i.e. supplied with electricity . Material may be added to conduit or removed from the conduit after operation of the heater is initialized. Material may be added to or removed from conduit to maintain a desired head of fluid in the conduit. In some embodiments the amount of material in conduit may be adjusted i.e. added to or depleted to adjust or balance the stresses on the conduit. Material may inhibit deformation of conduit . The head of material in conduit may inhibit the formation from crushing or otherwise deforming the conduit should the formation expand against the conduit. The head of fluid in conduit allows the wall of the conduit to be relatively thin. Having thin conduits may increase the economic viability of using multiple heaters of this type to heat portions of the formation.

Material may support insulated conductor in conduit . The support provided by material of insulated conductor may allow for the deployment of long insulated conductors as compared to insulated conductors positioned only in a gas in a conduit without the use of special metallurgy to accommodate the weight of the insulated conductor. In certain embodiments insulated conductor is buoyant in material in conduit . For example insulated conductor may be buoyant in molten metal. The buoyancy of insulated conductor reduces creep associated problems in long substantially vertical heaters. A bottom weight or tie down may be coupled to the bottom of insulated conductor to inhibit the insulated conductor from floating in material .

Material may remain a liquid at operating temperatures of insulated conductor . In some embodiments material melts at temperatures above about 100 C. above about 200 C. or above about 300 C. The insulated conductor may operate at temperatures greater than 200 C. greater than 400 C. greater than 600 C. or greater than 800 C. In certain embodiments material provides enhanced heat transfer from insulated conductor to conduit at or near the operating temperatures of the insulated conductor.

Material may include metals such as tin zinc an alloy such as a 60 by weight tin 40 by weight zinc alloy bismuth indium cadmium aluminum lead and or combinations thereof for example eutectic alloys of these metals such as binary or ternary alloys . In one embodiment material is tin. Some liquid metals may be corrosive. The jacket of the insulated conductor and or at least the inside surface of the canister may need to be made of a material that is resistant to the corrosion of the liquid metal. The jacket of the insulated conductor and or at least the inside surface of the conduit may be made of materials that inhibit the molten metal from leaching materials from the insulating conductor and or the conduit to form eutectic compositions or metal alloys. Molten metals may be highly thermal conductive but may block radiant heat transfer from the insulated conductor and or have relatively small heat transfer by natural convection.

Material may be or include molten salts such as solar salt salts presented in Table 1 or other salts. The molten salts may be infrared transparent to aid in heat transfer from the insulated conductor to the canister. In some embodiments solar salt includes sodium nitrate and potassium nitrate for example about 60 by weight sodium nitrate and about 40 by weight potassium nitrate . Solar salt melts at about 220 C. and is chemically stable up to temperatures of about 593 C. Other salts that may be used include but are not limited to LiNO melt temperature T of 264 C. and a decomposition temperature of about 600 C. and eutectic mixtures such as 53 by weight KNO 40 by weight NaNOand 7 by weight NaNO Tof about 142 C. and an upper working temperature of over 500 C. 45.5 by weight KNOand 54.5 by weight NaNO Tof about 142 145 C. and an upper working temperature of over 500 C. or 50 by weight NaCl and 50 by weight SrCl Tof about 19 C. and an upper working temperature of over 1200 C. .

Some molten salts such as solar salt may be relatively non corrosive so that the conduit and or the jacket may be made of relatively inexpensive material for example carbon steel . Some molten salts may have good thermal conductivity may have high heat density and may result in large heat transfer by natural convection.

In fluid mechanics the Rayleigh number is a dimensionless number associated with heat transfer in a fluid. When the Rayleigh number is below the critical value for the fluid heat transfer is primarily in the form of conduction and when the Rayleigh number is above the critical value heat transfer is primarily in the form of convection. The Rayleigh number is the product of the Grashof number which describes the relationship between buoyancy and viscosity in a fluid and the Prandtl number which describes the relationship between momentum diffusivity and thermal diffusivity . For the same size insulated conductors in conduits and where the temperature of the conduit is 500 C. the Rayleigh number for solar salt in the conduit is about 10 times the Rayleigh number for tin in the conduit. The higher Rayleigh number implies that the strength of natural convection in the molten solar salt is much stronger than the strength of the natural convection in molten tin. The stronger natural convection of molten salt may distribute heat and inhibit the formation of hot spots at locations along the length of the conduit. Hot spots may be caused by coke build up at isolated locations adjacent to or on the conduit contact of the conduit by the formation at isolated locations and or other high thermal load situations.

Conduit may be a carbon steel or stainless steel canister. In some embodiments conduit may include cladding on the outer surface to inhibit corrosion of the conduit by formation fluid. Conduit may include cladding on an inner surface of the conduit that is corrosion resistant to material in the conduit. Cladding applied to conduit may be a coating and or a liner. If the conduit contains a metal salt the inner surface of the conduit may include coating of nickel or the conduit may be or include a liner of a corrosion resistant metal such as Alloy N. If the conduit contains a molten metal the conduit may include a corrosion resistant metal liner or coating and or a ceramic coating for example a porcelain coating or fired enamel coating . In an embodiment conduit is a canister of 410 stainless steel with an outside diameter of about 6 cm. Conduit may not need a thick wall because material may provide internal pressure that inhibits deformation or crushing of the conduit due to external stresses.

In some embodiments two or more insulated conductors are placed in the conduit. In some embodiments only one of the insulated conductors is energized. Should the energized conductor fail one of the other conductors may be energized to maintain the material in a molten phase. The failed insulated conductor may be removed and or replaced.

The conduit of the heater may be a ribbed conduit. The ribbed conduit may improve the heat transfer characteristics of the conduit as compared to a cylindrical conduit. depicts a cross sectional representation of ribbed conduit . depicts a perspective view of a portion of ribbed conduit . Ribbed conduit may include rings and ribs . Rings and ribs may improve the heat transfer characteristics of ribbed conduit . In an embodiment the cylinder of conduit has an inner diameter of about 5.1 cm and a wall thickness of about 0.57 cm. Rings may be spaced about every 3.8 cm. Rings may have a height of about 1.9 cm and a thickness of about 0.5 cm. Six ribs may be spaced evenly about conduit . Ribs may have a thickness of about 0.5 cm and a height of about 1.6 cm. Other dimensions for the cylinder rings and ribs may be used. Ribbed conduit may be formed from two or more rolled pieces that are welded together to form the ribbed conduit. Other types of conduit with extra surface area to enhance heat transfer from the conduit to the formation may be used.

In some embodiments the ribbed conduit may be used as the conduit of a conductor in conduit heater. For example the conductor may be a 3.05 cm 410 stainless steel rod and the conduit has dimensions as described above. In other embodiments the conductor is an insulated conductor and a fluid is positioned between the conductor and the ribbed conduit. The fluid may be a gas or liquid at operating temperatures of the insulated conductor.

In some embodiments the heat source for the heater is not an insulated conductor. For example the heat source may be hot fluid circulated through an inner conduit positioned in an outer conduit. The material may be positioned between the inner conduit and the outer conduit. Convection currents in the material may help to more evenly distribute heat to the formation and may inhibit or limit formation of a hot spot where insulation that limits heat transfer to the overburden ends. In some embodiments the heat sources are downhole oxidizers. The material is placed between an outer conduit and an oxidizer conduit. The oxidizer conduit may be an exhaust conduit for the oxidizers or the oxidant conduit if the oxidizers are positioned in a u shaped wellbore with exhaust gases exiting the formation through one of the legs of the u shaped conduit. The material may help inhibit the formation of hot spots adjacent to the oxidizers of the oxidizer assembly.

The material to be heated by the insulated conductor may be placed in an open wellbore. depicts material in open wellbore in formation with insulated conductor in the wellbore. In some embodiments a gas for example nitrogen carbon dioxide and or helium is placed in wellbore above material . The gas may inhibit oxidation or other chemical changes of material . The gas may inhibit vaporization of material .

Material may have a melting point that is above the pyrolysis temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation. The melting point of material may be above 375 C. above 400 C. or above 425 C. The insulated conductor may be energized to heat the formation. Heat from the insulated conductor may pyrolyze hydrocarbons in the formation. Adjacent the wellbore the heat from insulated conductor may result in coking that reduces the permeability and plugs the formation near wellbore . The plugged formation inhibits material from leaking from wellbore into formation when the material is a liquid. In some embodiments material is a salt.

Return electrical current for insulated conductor may return through jacket of the insulated conductor. Any current that passes through material may pass to ground. Above the level of material any remaining return electrical current may be confined to jacket of insulated conductor .

In some embodiments other types of heat sources besides for insulated conductors are used to heat the material placed in the open wellbore. The other types of heat sources may include gas burners pipes through which hot heat transfer fluid flows or other types of heaters.

In some embodiments heat pipes are placed in the formation. The heat pipes may reduce the number of active heat sources needed to heat a treatment area of a given size. The heat pipes may reduce the time needed to heat the treatment area of a given size to a desired average temperature. A heat pipe is a closed system that utilizes phase change of fluid in the heat pipe to transport heat applied to a first region to a second region remote from the first region. The phase change of the fluid allows for large heat transfer rates. Heat may be applied to the first region of the heat pipes from any type of heat source including but not limited to electric heaters oxidizers heat provided from geothermal sources and or heat provided from nuclear reactors.

Heat pipes are passive heat transport systems that include no moving parts. Heat pipes may be positioned in near horizontal to vertical configurations. The fluid used in heat pipes for heating the formation may have a low cost a low melting temperature a boiling temperature that is not too high e.g. generally below about 900 C. a low viscosity at temperatures below above about 540 C. a high heat of vaporization and a low corrosion rate for the heat pipe material. In some embodiments the heat pipe includes a liner of material that is resistant to corrosion by the fluid. TABLE 1 shows melting and boiling temperatures for several materials that may be used as the fluid in heat pipes. Other salts that may be used include but are not limited to LiNO and eutectic mixtures such as 53 by weight KNO 40 by weight NaNOand 7 by weight NaNO 45.5 by weight KNOand 54.5 by weight NaNO or 50 by weight NaCl and 50 by weight SrCl.

Heat pipes may include sealed conduit seal liquid heat transfer fluid and vaporized heat transfer fluid . In some embodiments heat pipes include metal mesh or wicking material that increases the surface area for condensation and or promotes flow of the heat transfer fluid in the heat pipe. Conduit may have first portion and second portion . Liquid heat transfer fluid may be in first portion . Heat source external to heat pipe supplies heat that vaporizes liquid heat transfer fluid . Vaporized heat transfer fluid diffuses into second portion . Vaporized heat transfer fluid condenses in second portion and transfers heat to conduit which in turn transfers heat to the formation. The condensed liquid heat transfer fluid flows by gravity to first portion .

Position of seal is a factor in determining the effective length of heat pipe . The effective length of heat pipe may also depend on the physical properties of the heat transfer fluid and the cross sectional area of conduit . Enough heat transfer fluid may be placed in conduit so that some liquid heat transfer fluid is present in first portion at all times.

Seal may provide a top seal for conduit . In some embodiments conduit is purged with nitrogen helium or other fluid prior to being loaded with heat transfer fluid and sealed. In some embodiments a vacuum may be drawn on conduit to evacuate the conduit before the conduit is sealed. Drawing a vacuum on conduit before sealing the conduit may enhance vapor diffusion throughout the conduit. In some embodiments an oxygen getter may be introduced in conduit to react with any oxygen present in the conduit.

In some embodiments the temperature limited heater is used to achieve lower temperature heating for example for heating fluids in a production well heating a surface pipeline or reducing the viscosity of fluids in a wellbore or near wellbore region . Varying the ferromagnetic materials of the temperature limited heater allows for lower temperature heating. In some embodiments the ferromagnetic conductor is made of material with a lower Curie temperature than that of 446 stainless steel. For example the ferromagnetic conductor may be an alloy of iron and nickel. The alloy may have between 30 by weight and 42 by weight nickel with the rest being iron. In one embodiment the alloy is Invar 36. Invar 36 is 36 by weight nickel in iron and has a Curie temperature of 277 C. In some embodiments an alloy is a three component alloy with for example chromium nickel and iron. For example an alloy may have 6 by weight chromium 42 by weight nickel and 52 by weight iron. A 2.5 cm diameter rod of Invar 36 has a turndown ratio of approximately 2 to 1 at the Curie temperature. Placing the Invar 36 alloy over a copper core may allow for a smaller rod diameter. A copper core may result in a high turndown ratio. The insulator in lower temperature heater embodiments may be made of a high performance polymer insulator such as PFA or PEEK when used with alloys with a Curie temperature that is below the melting point or softening point of the polymer insulator.

In certain embodiments a conductor in conduit temperature limited heater is used in lower temperature applications by using lower Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range ferromagnetic materials. For example a lower Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range ferromagnetic material may be used for heating inside sucker pump rods. Heating sucker pump rods may be useful to lower the viscosity of fluids in the sucker pump or rod and or to maintain a lower viscosity of fluids in the sucker pump rod. Lowering the viscosity of the oil may inhibit sticking of a pump used to pump the fluids. Fluids in the sucker pump rod may be heated up to temperatures less than about 250 C. or less than about 300 C. Temperatures need to be maintained below these values to inhibit coking of hydrocarbon fluids in the sucker pump system.

In certain embodiments a temperature limited heater includes a flexible cable for example a furnace cable as the inner conductor. For example the inner conductor may be a 27 nickel clad or stainless steel clad stranded copper wire with four layers of mica tape surrounded by a layer of ceramic and or mineral fiber for example alumina fiber aluminosilicate fiber borosilicate fiber or aluminoborosilicate fiber . A stainless steel clad stranded copper wire furnace cable may be available from Anomet Products Inc. The inner conductor may be rated for applications at temperatures of 1000 C. or higher. The inner conductor may be pulled inside a conduit. The conduit may be a ferromagnetic conduit for example a Schedule 80 446 stainless steel pipe . The conduit may be covered with a layer of copper or other electrical conductor with a thickness of about 0.3 cm or any other suitable thickness. The assembly may be placed inside a support conduit for example a 1 Schedule 80 347H or 347HH stainless steel tubular . The support conduit may provide additional creep rupture strength and protection for the copper and the inner conductor. For uses at temperatures greater than about 1000 C. the inner copper conductor may be plated with a more corrosion resistant alloy for example Incoloy 825 to inhibit oxidation. In some embodiments the top of the temperature limited heater is sealed to inhibit air from contacting the inner conductor.

The temperature limited heater may be a single phase heater or a three phase heater. In a three phase heater embodiment the temperature limited heater has a delta or a wye configuration. Each of the three ferromagnetic conductors in the three phase heater may be inside a separate sheath. A connection between conductors may be made at the bottom of the heater inside a splice section. The three conductors may remain insulated from the sheath inside the splice section.

In some embodiments the three phase heater includes three legs that are located in separate wellbores. The legs may be coupled in a common contacting section for example a central wellbore a connecting wellbore or a solution filled contacting section . depicts an embodiment of temperature limited heaters coupled in a three phase configuration. Each leg may be located in separate openings in hydrocarbon layer . Each leg may include heating element . Each leg may be coupled to single contacting element in one opening . Contacting element may electrically couple legs together in a three phase configuration. Contacting element may be located in for example a central opening in the formation. Contacting element may be located in a portion of opening below hydrocarbon layer for example in the underburden . In certain embodiments magnetic tracking of a magnetic element located in a central opening for example opening of leg is used to guide the formation of the outer openings for example openings of legs and so that the outer openings intersect the central opening. The central opening may be formed first using standard wellbore drilling methods. Contacting element may include funnels guides or catchers for allowing each leg to be inserted into the contacting element.

In certain embodiments heating elements are exposed to hydrocarbon layer and fluids from the hydrocarbon layer. Thus heating elements are bare metal or exposed metal heating elements. Heating elements may be made from a material that has an acceptable sulfidation rate at high temperatures used for pyrolyzing hydrocarbons. In certain embodiments heating elements are made from material that has a sulfidation rate that decreases with increasing temperature over at least a certain temperature range for example 500 C. to 650 C. 530 C. to 650 C. or 550 C. to 650 C. . For example 410 stainless steel may have a sulfidation rate that decreases with increasing temperature between 530 C. and 650 C. Using such materials reduces corrosion problems due to sulfur containing gases such as HS from the formation. In certain embodiments heating elements are made from material that has a sulfidation rate below a selected value in a temperature range. In some embodiments heating elements are made from material that has a sulfidation rate at most about 25 mils per year at a temperature between about 800 C. and about 880 C. In some embodiments the sulfidation rate is at most about 35 mils per year at a temperature between about 800 C. and about 880 C. at most about 45 mils per year at a temperature between about 800 C. and about 880 C. or at most about 55 mils per year at a temperature between about 800 C. and about 880 C. Heating elements may also be substantially inert to galvanic corrosion.

In some embodiments heating elements have a thin electrically insulating layer such as aluminum oxide or thermal spray coated aluminum oxide. In some embodiments the thin electrically insulating layer is a ceramic composition such as an enamel coating. Enamel coatings include but are not limited to high temperature porcelain enamels. High temperature porcelain enamels may include silicon dioxide boron oxide alumina and alkaline earth oxides CaO or MgO and minor amounts of alkali oxides NaO KO LiO . The enamel coating may be applied as a finely ground slurry by dipping the heating element into the slurry or spray coating the heating element with the slurry. The coated heating element is then heated in a furnace until the glass transition temperature is reached so that the slurry spreads over the surface of the heating element and makes the porcelain enamel coating. The porcelain enamel coating contracts when cooled below the glass transition temperature so that the coating is in compression. Thus when the coating is heated during operation of the heater the coating is able to expand with the heater without cracking.

The thin electrically insulating layer has low thermal impedance allowing heat transfer from the heating element to the formation while inhibiting current leakage between heating elements in adjacent openings and or current leakage into the formation. In certain embodiments the thin electrically insulating layer is stable at temperatures above at least 350 C. above 500 C. or above 800 C. In certain embodiments the thin electrically insulating layer has an emissivity of at least 0.7 at least 0.8 or at least 0.9. Using the thin electrically insulating layer may allow for long heater lengths in the formation with low current leakage.

Heating elements may be coupled to contacting elements at or near the underburden of the formation. Contacting elements are copper or aluminum rods or other highly conductive materials. In certain embodiments transition sections are located between lead in conductors and heating elements and or between heating elements and contacting elements . Transition sections may be made of a conductive material that is corrosion resistant such as 347 stainless steel over a copper core. In certain embodiments transition sections are made of materials that electrically couple lead in conductors and heating elements while providing little or no heat output. Thus transition sections help to inhibit overheating of conductors and insulation used in lead in conductors by spacing the lead in conductors from heating elements . Transition section may have a length of between about 3 m and about 9 m for example about 6 m .

Contacting elements are coupled to contactor in contacting section to electrically couple legs to each other. In some embodiments contact solution for example conductive cement is placed in contacting section to electrically couple contacting elements in the contacting section. In certain embodiments legs are substantially parallel in hydrocarbon layer and leg continues substantially vertically into contacting section . The other two legs are directed for example by directionally drilling the wellbores for the legs to intercept leg in contacting section .

Each leg may be one leg of a three phase heater embodiment so that the legs are substantially electrically isolated from other heaters in the formation and are substantially electrically isolated from the formation. Legs may be arranged in a triangular pattern so that the three legs form a triangular shaped three phase heater. In an embodiment legs are arranged in a triangular pattern with 12 m spacing between the legs each side of the triangle has a length of 12 m .

In certain embodiments centralizer parts A B C include insulators and weld bases . Insulators may be made of electrically insulating material such as but not limited to ceramic for example magnesium oxide or silicon nitride. Weld bases may be made of weldable metal such as but not limited to Alloy 625 the same metal used for heater or another metal that may be brazed or solid state welded to insulators and welded to a metal used for heater .

In certain embodiments insulators are brazed or otherwise coupled to weld bases to form centralizer parts A B C. In some embodiments weld bases are coupled to heater first and then insulators are coupled to the weld bases to form centralizer parts A B C. Insulators may be coupled to weld bases as the heater is being installed into the formation.

In certain embodiments centralizer parts A B C are spaced evenly around the outside diameter of heater as shown in . In other embodiments centralizer parts A B C have other spacings around the outside diameter of heater .

Having space between centralizer parts A B C allows installation of the heaters and centralizers from a spool or coiled tubing installation of the heaters and centralizers. Centralizer parts A B C also allow debris for example metal dust or pieces of formation to fall along heater through the area of the centralizer. Thus debris is inhibited from collecting at or near centralizer . In addition centralizer parts A B C may be inexpensive to manufacture and install and easy to replace if broken.

In certain embodiments overburden casings for example overburden casings depicted in in overburden include materials that inhibit ferromagnetic effects in the casings. Inhibiting ferromagnetic effects in casings reduces heat losses to the overburden. In some embodiments casings may include non metallic materials such as fiberglass polyvinylchloride PVC chlorinated polyvinylchloride CPVC or high density polyethylene HDPE . HDPEs with working temperatures in a range for use in overburden include HDPEs available from Dow Chemical Co. Inc. Midland Mich. U.S.A. . A non metallic casing may also eliminate the need for an insulated overburden conductor. In some embodiments casings include carbon steel coupled on the inside diameter of a non ferromagnetic metal for example carbon steel clad with copper or aluminum to inhibit ferromagnetic effects or inductive effects in the carbon steel. Other non ferromagnetic metals include but are not limited to manganese steels with at least 10 by weight manganese iron aluminum alloys with at least 18 by weight aluminum and austentitic stainless steels such as 304 stainless steel or 316 stainless steel.

In certain embodiments one or more non ferromagnetic materials used in casings are used in a wellhead coupled to the casings and legs . Using non ferromagnetic materials in the wellhead inhibits undesirable heating of components in the wellhead. In some embodiments a purge gas for example carbon dioxide nitrogen or argon is introduced into the wellhead and or inside of casings to inhibit reflux of heated gases into the wellhead and or the casings.

In certain embodiments one or more of legs are installed in the formation using coiled tubing. In certain embodiments coiled tubing is installed in the formation the leg is installed inside the coiled tubing and the coiled tubing is pulled out of the formation to leave the leg installed in the formation. The leg may be placed concentrically inside the coiled tubing. In some embodiments coiled tubing with the leg inside the coiled tubing is installed in the formation and the coiled tubing is removed from the formation to leave the leg installed in the formation. The coiled tubing may extend only to a junction of the hydrocarbon layer and the contacting section or to a point at which the leg begins to bend in the contacting section.

The phases of each triad may be arranged so that legs A B C correspond between triads as shown in . In legs A B C are arranged such that a phase leg for example leg A in a given triad is about two triad heights from a same phase leg leg A in an adjacent triad. The triad height is the distance from a vertex of the triad to a midpoint of the line intersecting the other two vertices of the triad. In certain embodiments the phases of triads are arranged to inhibit net current flow between individual triads. There may be some leakage of current within an individual triad but little net current flows between two triads due to the substantial electrical isolation of the triads and in certain embodiments the arrangement of the triad phases.

In the early stages of heating an exposed heating element for example heating element depicted in may leak some current to water or other fluids that are electrically conductive in the formation so that the formation itself is heated. After water or other electrically conductive fluids are removed from the wellbore for example vaporized or produced the heating elements become electrically isolated from the formation. Later when water is removed from the formation the formation becomes even more electrically resistant and heating of the formation occurs even more predominantly via thermally conductive and or radiative heating. Typically the formation the hydrocarbon layer has an initial electrical resistance that averages at least 10 ohm m. In some embodiments the formation has an initial electrical resistance of at least 100 ohm m or of at least 300 ohm m.

Using the temperature limited heaters as the heating elements limits the effect of water saturation on heater efficiency. With water in the formation and in heater wellbores there is a tendency for electrical current to flow between heater elements at the top of the hydrocarbon layer where the voltage is highest and cause uneven heating in the hydrocarbon layer. This effect is inhibited with temperature limited heaters because the temperature limited heaters reduce localized overheating in the heating elements and in the hydrocarbon layer.

In certain embodiments production wells are placed at a location at which there is relatively little or zero voltage potential. This location minimizes stray potentials at the production well. Placing production wells at such locations improves the safety of the system and reduces or inhibits undesired heating of the production wells caused by electrical current flow in the production wells. depicts a top view representation of the embodiment depicted in with production wells . In certain embodiments production wells are located at or near center of triad . In certain embodiments production wells are placed at a location between triads at which there is relatively little or zero voltage potential at a location at which voltage potentials from vertices of three triads average out to relatively little or zero voltage potential . For example production well may be at a location equidistant from legs A of one triad leg B of a second triad and leg C of a third triad as shown in .

Production well may be placed at or near the center of hexagon . Placing production well at or near the center of hexagon places the production well at a location that reduces or inhibits undesired heating due to electromagnetic effects caused by electrical current flow in the legs of the triads and increases the safety of the system. Having two triads in hexagon provides for redundant heating around production well . Thus if one triad fails or has to be turned off production well still remains at a center of one triad.

As shown in hexagons may be arranged in a pattern in the formation such that adjacent hexagons are offset. Using electrically isolated transformers on adjacent hexagons may inhibit electrical potentials in the formation so that little or no net current leaks between hexagons.

Triads of heaters and or heater legs may be arranged in any shape or desired pattern. For example as described above triads may include three heaters and or heater legs arranged in an equilateral triangular pattern. In some embodiments triads include three heaters and or heater legs arranged in other triangular shapes for example an isosceles triangle or a right angle triangle . In some embodiments heater legs in the triad cross each other for example criss cross in the formation. In certain embodiments triads includes three heaters and or heater legs arranged sequentially along a straight line.

Distal sections of the heater legs may be electrically coupled together. The distal sections may be electrically coupled to a connector or to each other. In certain embodiments contacting elements of the heater legs are physically coupled to establish the electrical coupling. For example heater legs may be electrically coupled by soldering by welding by explosive crimping by interconnecting brush contacts and or by other techniques that involve physically attaching the legs to each other or to a connector. In some embodiments the contacting elements of the heater legs are placed in a contacting solution or other electrically conductive material to electrically couple the heater legs together.

Contacting elements are coupled to contactor in contacting section to electrically couple legs A A A to each other to form triad A and electrically couple legs B B B to each other to form triad B. In certain embodiments contactor is a ground conductor so that triad A and or triad B may be coupled in three phase wye configurations. In certain embodiments triad A and triad B are electrically isolated from each other. In some embodiments triad A and triad B are electrically coupled to each other for example electrically coupled in series or parallel .

In certain embodiments contactor is a substantially horizontal contactor located in contacting section . Contactor may be a casing or a solid rod placed in a wellbore drilled substantially horizontally in contacting section . Legs A A A and legs B B B may be electrically coupled to contactor by any method described herein or any method known in the art. For example containers with thermite powder are coupled to contactor for example by welding or brazing the containers to the contactor legs A A A and legs B B B are placed inside the containers and the thermite powder is activated to electrically couple the legs to the contactor. The containers may be coupled to contactor by for example placing the containers in holes or recesses in contactor or coupled to the outside of the contactor and then brazing or welding the containers to the contactor.

In certain embodiments two legs in separate wellbores intercept in a single contacting section. depicts an embodiment of two temperature limited heaters coupled in a single contacting section. Legs and include one or more heating elements . Heating elements may include one or more electrical conductors. In certain embodiments legs and are electrically coupled in a single phase configuration with one leg positively biased versus the other leg so that current flows downhole through one leg and returns through the other leg.

Heating elements in legs and may be temperature limited heaters. In certain embodiments heating elements are solid rod heaters. For example heating elements may be rods made of a single ferromagnetic conductor element or composite conductors that include ferromagnetic material. During initial heating when water is present in the formation being heated heating elements may leak current into hydrocarbon layer . The current leaked into hydrocarbon layer may resistively heat the hydrocarbon layer.

In some embodiments for example in oil shale formations heating elements do not need support members. Heating elements may be partially or slightly bent curved made into an S shape or made into a helical shape to allow for expansion and or contraction of the heating elements. In certain embodiments solid rod heating elements are placed in small diameter wellbores for example about 3 about 9.5 cm diameter wellbores . Small diameter wellbores may be less expensive to drill or form than larger diameter wellbores and there will be less cuttings to dispose of.

In certain embodiments portions of legs and in overburden have insulation for example polymer insulation to inhibit heating the overburden. Heating elements may be substantially vertical and substantially parallel to each other in hydrocarbon layer . At or near the bottom of hydrocarbon layer leg may be directionally drilled towards leg to intercept leg in contacting section . Drilling two wellbores to intercept each other may be easier and less expensive than drilling three or more wellbores to intercept each other. The depth of contacting section depends on the length of bend in leg needed to intercept leg . For example for a 40 ft about 12 m spacing between vertical portions of legs and about 200 ft about 61 m is needed to allow the bend of leg to intercept leg . Coupling two legs may require a thinner contacting section than coupling three or more legs in the contacting section.

In certain embodiments contacting elements include one or more fins or projections. The fins or projections may increase an electrical contact area of contacting elements . In some embodiments contacting element of leg has an opening or other orifice that allows the contacting element of to couple to the contacting element of leg .

In certain embodiments legs and are coupled together to form a diad. Three diads may be coupled to a three phase transformer to power the legs of the heaters. depicts an embodiment of three diads coupled to a three phase transformer. In certain embodiments transformer is a delta three phase transformer. Diad A includes legs A and A. Diad B includes legs B and B. Diad C includes legs C and C. Diads A B C are coupled to the secondaries of transformer . Diad A is coupled to the A secondary. Diad B is coupled to the B secondary. Diad C is coupled to the C secondary.

Coupling the diads to the secondaries of the delta three phase transformer isolates the diads from ground. Isolating the diads from ground inhibits leakage to the formation from the diads. Coupling the diads to different phases of the delta three phase transformer also inhibits leakage between the heating legs of the diads in the formation.

In some embodiments diads are used for treating formations using triangular or hexagonal heater patterns. depicts an embodiment of groups of diads in a hexagonal pattern. Heaters may be placed at the vertices of each of the hexagons in the hexagonal pattern. Each group of diads enclosed by dashed circles may be coupled to a separate three phase transformer. A B and C inside groups represent each diad for example diads A B C depicted in that is coupled to each of the three secondary phases of the transformer with each phase coupled to one diad with the heaters at the vertices of the hexagon . The numbers 1 2 and 3 inside the hexagons represent the three repeating types of hexagons in the pattern depicted in .

In certain embodiments exposed metal heating elements are used in substantially horizontal sections of u shaped wellbores. Substantially u shaped wellbores may be used in tar sands formations oil shale formation or other formations with relatively thin hydrocarbon layers. Tar sands or thin oil shale formations may have thin shallow layers that are more easily and uniformly heated using heaters placed in substantially u shaped wellbores. Substantially u shaped wellbores may also be used to process formations with thick hydrocarbon layers. In some embodiments substantially u shaped wellbores are used to access rich layers in a thick hydrocarbon formation.

Heaters in substantially u shaped wellbores may have long lengths compared to heaters in vertical wellbores because horizontal heating sections do not have problems with creep or hanging stress encountered with vertical heating elements. Substantially u shaped wellbores may make use of natural seals in the formation and or the limited thickness of the hydrocarbon layer. For example the wellbores may be placed above or below natural seals in the formation without punching large numbers of holes in the natural seals as would be needed with vertically oriented wellbores. Using substantially u shaped wellbores instead of vertical wellbores may also reduce the number of wells needed to treat a surface footprint of the formation. Using less wells reduces capital costs for equipment and reduces the environmental impact of treating the formation by reducing the amount of wellbores on the surface and the amount of equipment on the surface. Substantially u shaped wellbores may also utilize a lower ratio of overburden section to heated section than vertical wellbores.

Substantially u shaped wellbores may allow for flexible placement of opening of the wellbores on the surface. Openings to the wellbores may be placed according to the surface topology of the formation. In certain embodiments the openings of wellbores are placed at geographically accessible locations such as topological highs for examples hills . For example the wellbore may have a first opening on a first topologic high and a second opening on a second topologic high and the wellbore crosses beneath a topologic low for example a valley with alluvial fill between the first and second topologic highs. This placement of the openings may avoid placing openings or equipment in topologic lows or other inaccessible locations. In addition the water level may not be artesian in topologically high areas. Wellbores may be drilled so that the openings are not located near environmentally sensitive areas such as but not limited to streams nesting areas or animal refuges.

In certain embodiments portions of heating elements are substantially parallel in hydrocarbon layer . In certain embodiments heating elements are exposed metal heating elements. In certain embodiments heating elements are exposed metal temperature limited heating elements. Heating elements may include ferromagnetic materials such as 9 by weight to 13 by weight chromium stainless steel like 410 stainless steel chromium stainless steels such as T P91 or T P92 409 stainless steel VM12 Vallourec and Mannesmann Tubes France or iron cobalt alloys for use as temperature limited heaters. In some embodiments heating elements are composite temperature limited heating elements such as 410 stainless steel and copper composite heating elements or 347H iron copper composite heating elements. Heating elements may have lengths of at least about 100 m at least about 500 m or at least about 1000 m up to lengths of about 6000 m.

Heating elements may be solid rods or tubulars. In certain embodiments solid rod heating elements have diameters several times the skin depth at the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material. Typically the solid rod heating elements may have diameters of 1.91 cm or larger for example 2.5 cm 3.2 cm 3.81 cm or 5.1 cm . In certain embodiments tubular heating elements have wall thicknesses of at least twice the skin depth at the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material. Typically the tubular heating elements have outside diameters of between about 2.5 cm and about 15.2 cm and wall thickness in range between about 0.13 cm and about 1.01 cm.

In certain embodiments tubular heating elements allow fluids to be convected through the tubular heating elements. Fluid flowing through the tubular heating elements may be used to preheat the tubular heating elements to initially heat the formation and or to recover heat from the formation after heating is completed for the in situ heat treatment process. Fluids that may flow through the tubular heating elements include but are not limited to air water steam helium carbon dioxide or other fluids. In some embodiments a hot fluid such as carbon dioxide or helium flows through the tubular heating elements to provide heat to the formation. The hot fluid may be used to provide heat to the formation before electrical heating is used to provide heat to the formation. In some embodiments the hot fluid is used to provide heat in addition to electrical heating. Using the hot fluid to provide heat to the formation in addition to providing electrical heating may be less expensive than using electrical heating alone to provide heat to the formation. In some embodiments water and or steam flows through the tubular heating element to recover heat from the formation. The heated water and or steam may be used for solution mining and or other processes.

Transition sections may couple heating elements to sections . In certain embodiments transition sections include material that has a high electrical conductivity but is corrosion resistant such as 347 stainless steel over copper. In an embodiment transition sections include a composite of stainless steel clad over copper. Transition sections inhibit overheating of copper and or insulation in sections .

As depicted in cables may be coupled to transformer and one or more heater units such as the heater unit including heaters A B C. Cables may carry a large amount of power. In certain embodiments cables are capable of carrying high currents with low losses. For example cables may be thick copper or aluminum conductors. The cables may also have thick insulation layers. In some embodiments cable and or cable may be superconducting cables. The superconducting cables may be cooled by liquid nitrogen. Superconducting cables are available from Superpower Inc. Schenectady N.Y. U.S.A. . Superconducting cables may minimize power loss and reduce the size of the cables needed to couple transformer to the heaters. In some embodiments cables may be made of carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes as conductors may have about 1000 times the conductivity of copper for the same diameter. Also carbon nanotubes may not require refrigeration during use.

In certain embodiments bus bar A is coupled to first end portions of heaters A L and bus bar B is coupled to second end portions of heaters A L. Bus bars A B electrically couple heaters A L to cables and transformer . Bus bars A B distribute power to heaters A L. In certain embodiments bus bars A B are capable of carrying high currents with low losses. In some embodiments bus bars A B are made of superconducting material such as the superconductor material used in cables . In some embodiments bus bars A B may include carbon nanotube conductors.

As shown in heaters A L are coupled to a single transformer . In certain embodiments transformer is a source of time varying current. In certain embodiments transformer is an electrically isolated single phase transformer. In certain embodiments transformer provides power to heaters A L from an isolated secondary phase of the transformer. First end portions of heaters A L may be coupled to one side of transformer while second end portions of the heaters are coupled to the opposite side of the transformer. Transformer provides a substantially common voltage to the first end portions of heaters A L and a substantially common voltage to the second end portions of heaters A L. In certain embodiments transformer applies a voltage potential to the first end portions of heaters A L that is opposite in polarity and substantially equal in magnitude to a voltage potential applied to the second end portions of the heaters. For example a 660 V potential may be applied to the first end portions of heaters A L and a 660 V potential applied to the second end portions of the heaters at a selected point on the wave of time varying current such as AC or modulated DC . Thus the voltages at the two end portion of the heaters may be equal in magnitude and opposite in polarity with an average voltage that is substantially at ground potential.

Applying the same voltage potentials to the end portions of all heaters A L produces voltage potentials along the lengths of the heaters that are substantially the same along the lengths of the heaters. depicts a cross sectional representation along a vertical plane such as the plane A A shown in of substantially u shaped heaters in a hydrocarbon layer. The voltage potential at the cross sectional point shown in along the length of heater A is substantially the same as the voltage potential at the corresponding cross sectional points on heaters A L shown in . At lines equidistant between heater wellheads the voltage potential is approximately zero. Other wells such as production wells or monitoring wells may be located along these zero voltage potential lines if desired. Production wells located close to the overburden may be used to transport formation fluid that is initially in a vapor phase to the surface. Production wells located close to a bottom of the heated portion of the formation may be used to transport formation fluid that is initially in a liquid phase to the surface.

In certain embodiments the voltage potential at the midpoint of heaters A L is about zero. Having similar voltage potentials along the lengths of heaters A L inhibits current leakage between the heaters. Thus there is little or no current flow in the formation and the heaters may have long lengths as described above. Having the opposite polarity and substantially equal voltage potentials at the end portions of the heaters also halves the voltage applied at either end portion of the heater versus having one end portion of the heater grounded and one end portion at full potential. Reducing halving the voltage potential applied to an end portion of the heater generally reduces current leakage reduces insulator requirements and or reduces arcing distances because of the lower voltage potential to ground applied at the end portions of the heaters.

In certain embodiments substantially vertical heaters are used to provide heat to the formation. Opposite polarity and substantially equal voltage potentials as described above may be applied to the end portions of the substantially vertical heaters. depicts a side view representation of substantially vertical heaters coupled to a substantially horizontal wellbore. Heaters A B C D E F are located substantially vertical in hydrocarbon layer . First end portions of heaters A B C D E F are coupled to bus bar A on a surface of the formation. Second end portions of heaters A B C D E F are coupled to bus bar B in contacting section .

Bus bar B may be a bus bar located in a substantially horizontal wellbore in contacting section . Second end portions of heaters A B C D E F may be coupled to bus bar B by any method described herein or any method known in the art. For example containers with thermite powder are coupled to bus bar B for example by welding or brazing the containers to the bus bar end portions of heaters A B C D E F are placed inside the containers and the thermite powder is activated to electrically couple the heaters to the bus bar. The containers may be coupled to bus bar B by for example placing the containers in holes or recesses in bus bar B or coupled to the outside of the bus bar and then brazing or welding the containers to the bus bar.

Bus bar A and bus bar B may be coupled to transformer with cables as described above. Transformer may provide voltages to bar A and bus bar B as described above for the embodiments depicted in . For example transformer may apply a voltage potential to the first end portions of heaters A F that is opposite in polarity and substantially equal in magnitude to a voltage potential applied to the second end portions of the heaters. Applying the same voltage potentials to the end portions of all heaters A F may produce voltage potentials along the lengths of the heaters that are substantially the same along the lengths of the heaters. Applying the same voltage potentials to the end portions of all heaters A F may inhibit current leakage between the heaters and or into the formation. In some embodiments heaters A F are electrically coupled in pairs to the isolated delta winding on the secondary of a three phase transformer.

In certain embodiments it may be advantageous to allow some current leakage into the formation during early stages of heating to heat the formation at a faster rate. Current leakage from the heaters into the formation electrically heats the formation directly. The formation is heated by direct electrical heating in addition to conductive heat provided by the heaters. The formation the hydrocarbon layer may have an initial electrical resistance that averages at least 10 ohm m. In some embodiments the formation has an initial electrical resistance of at least 100 ohm m or of at least 300 ohm m. Direct electrical heating is achieved by having opposite potentials applied to adjacent heaters in the hydrocarbon layer. Current may be allowed to leak into the formation until a selected temperature is reached in the heaters or in the formation. The selected temperature may be below or near the temperature that water proximate one or more heaters boils off. After water boils off the hydrocarbon layer is substantially electrically isolated from the heaters and direct heating of the formation is inefficient. After the selected temperature is reached the voltage potential is applied in the opposite polarity and substantially equal magnitude manner described above for so that adjacent heaters will have the same voltage potential along their lengths.

Current is allowed to leak into the formation by reversing the polarity of one or more heaters shown in so that a first group of heaters has a positive voltage potential at first location and a second group of heaters has a negative voltage potential at the first location. The first end portions at first location of a first group of heaters for example heaters A B D E G H J K depicted in are applied with a positive voltage potential that is substantially equal in magnitude to a negative voltage potential applied to the second end portions at second location of the first group of heaters. The first end portions at first location of the second group of heaters for example heaters C F L are applied with a negative voltage potential that is substantially equal in magnitude to the positive voltage potential applied to the first end portions of the first group of heaters. Similarly the second end portions at second location of the second group of heaters are applied with a positive voltage potential substantially equal in magnitude to the negative potential applied to the second end portions of the first group of heaters. After the selected temperature is reached the first end portions of both groups of heaters are applied with voltage potential that is opposite in polarity and substantially similar in magnitude to the voltage potential applied to the second end portions of both groups of heaters.

In some embodiments the heating elements have thin electrically insulating material described above to inhibit current leakage from the heating elements. In some embodiments the thin electrically insulating layer is aluminum oxide or thermal spray coated aluminum oxide. In some embodiments the thin electrically insulating layer is an enamel coating of a ceramic composition. The thin electrically insulating layer may inhibit heating elements of a three phase heater from leaking current between the elements from leaking current into the formation and from leaking current to other heaters in the formation. Thus the three phase heater may have a longer heater length.

In certain embodiments a plurality of substantially horizontal or inclined heaters are coupled to a single substantially horizontal bus bar in the subsurface formation. Having the plurality of substantially horizontal heaters connected to a single bus bar in the subsurface reduces the overall footprint of heaters on the surface of the formation and the number of wells drilled in the formation. In addition the amount of subsurface space used to couple the heaters may be minimized so that more of the formation is treated with heat to recover hydrocarbons for example there is less unheated depth in the formation . The number and spacing of heaters coupled to the single bus bar may be varied depending on factors such as but not limited to size of the treatment area vertical thickness of the formation heating requirements for the formation number of layers in the formation and capacity limitations of a surface power supply.

In certain embodiments heaters A B include exposed metal heating elements. In certain embodiments heaters A B include exposed metal temperature limited heating elements. The heating elements may include ferromagnetic materials such as 9 by weight to 13 by weight chromium stainless steel like 410 stainless steel chromium stainless steels such as T P91 or T P92 409 stainless steel VM12 Vallourec and Mannesmann Tubes France or iron cobalt alloys for use as temperature limited heaters. In some embodiments the heating elements are composite temperature limited heating elements such as 410 stainless steel and copper composite heating elements or 347H iron copper composite heating elements. The substantially horizontal sections of heaters A B in hydrocarbon layer may have lengths of at least about 100 m at least about 500 m or at least about 1000 m up to lengths of about 6000 m.

In some embodiments two groups of heaters A B enter the subsurface near each other and then branch away from each other in hydrocarbon layer . Having the surface portions of more than one group of heaters located near each other creates less of a surface footprint of the heaters and allows a single group of surface facilities to be used for both groups of heaters.

In certain embodiments the groups of heaters A or B are each coupled to a single transformer. In some embodiments three heaters in the groups are coupled in a triad configuration each heater is coupled to one of the phases A B or C of a three phase transformer and the bus bar is coupled to the neutral or center point of the transformer . Each phase of the three phase transformer may be coupled to more than one heater in each group of heaters for example phase A may be coupled to 5 heaters in the group of heaters A . In some embodiments the heaters are coupled to a single phase transformer either in series or in parallel configurations .

In certain embodiments heaters A B are coupled to a single phase transformer in series or parallel. The heaters may be coupled so that the polarity direction of current flow alternates in the row of heaters so that each heater has a polarity opposite the heater adjacent to it. Additionally heaters A B and bus bars A B may be electrically coupled such that the bus bars are opposite in polarity from each other the current flows in opposite directions at any point in time in each bus bar . Coupling the heaters and the bus bars in such a manner inhibits current leakage into and or through the formation.

As shown in heaters A may be electrically coupled to bus bar A and heaters B may be electrically coupled to bus bar B. Bus bars A B may electrically couple to the ends of heaters A B and be a return or neutral connection for the heaters with bus bar A being the neutral connection for heaters A and bus bar B being the neutral connection for heaters B. Bus bars A B may be located in wellbores that are formed substantially perpendicular to the path of wellbores with heaters A B as shown in . Directional drilling and or magnetic steering may be used so that the wells for bus bars A B and the wellbores for heaters A B intersect.

In certain embodiments heaters A B are coupled to bus bars A B using mousetrap type connectors . In some embodiments other couplings such as those described herein or known in the art are used to couple heaters A B to bus bars A B. For example a molten metal or a liquid conducting fluid may fill up the connection space in the wellbores to electrically couple the heaters and the bus bars.

In some embodiments a centralizer or other centralizing device is used to locate or guide heaters and or bus bars so that the heaters and bus bars can be coupled. depicts an enlarged view of an embodiment of bus bar coupled to heater with connectors and centralizers . Centralizers may locate heater and or bus bar so that connectors easily couple the heater and the bus bar. Centralizers may ensure proper spacing of heater and or bus bar so that the heater and the bus bar can be coupled with connectors . Centralizers may inhibit heater and or bus bar from contacting the sides of the wellbores at or near connectors .

In some embodiments an explosive element is added to connector shown in . Connector is used to position bus bar and the heater in proper positions for explosive bonding of the bus bar to the heater. The explosive element may be located on connector . For example the explosive element may be located on one or both of collets . The explosive element may be used to explosively bond connector to bus bar so that the heater is metallically bonded to the bus bar.

In some embodiment the explosive bonding is applied along the axial direction of bus bar . In some embodiments the explosive bonding process is a self cleaning process. For example the explosive bonding process may drive out air and or debris from between components during the explosion. In some embodiments the explosive element is a shape charge explosive element. Using the shape charge element may focus the explosive energy in a desired direction.

In some embodiments heaters A B C are insulated conductor heaters. In some embodiments heaters A B C are conductor in conduit heaters. Heaters A B C may have substantially parallel heating sections in hydrocarbon layer . Heaters A B C may be substantially horizontal or at an incline in hydrocarbon layer . In some embodiments heaters A B C enter the formation through common wellbore A. Heaters A B C may exit the formation through common wellbore B. In certain embodiments wellbores A B are uncased for example open wellbores in hydrocarbon layer .

Openings A B C span between wellbore A and wellbore B. Openings A B C may be uncased openings in hydrocarbon layer . In certain embodiments openings A B C are formed by drilling from wellbore A and or wellbore B. In some embodiments openings A B C are formed by drilling from each wellbore A and B and connecting at or near the middle of the openings. Drilling from both sides towards the middle of hydrocarbon layer allows longer openings to be formed in the hydrocarbon layer. Thus longer heaters may be installed in hydrocarbon layer . For example heaters A B C may have lengths of at least about 1500 m at least about 3000 m or at least about 4500 m.

Having multiple long substantially horizontal or inclined heaters extending from only two wellbores in hydrocarbon layer reduces the footprint of wells on the surface needed for heating the formation. The number of overburden wellbores that need to be drilled in the formation is reduced which reduces capital costs per heater in the formation. Heating the formation with long substantially horizontal or inclined heaters also reduces overall heat losses in the overburden when heating the formation because of the reduced number of overburden sections used to treat the formation for example losses in the overburden are a smaller fraction of total power supplied to the formation .

In some embodiments heaters A B C are installed in wellbores A B and openings A B C by pulling the heaters through the wellbores and the openings from one end to the other. For example an installation tool may be pushed through the openings and coupled to a heater in wellbore A. The heater may then be pulled through the openings towards wellbore B using the installation tool. The heater may be coupled to the installation tool using a connector such as a claw a catcher or other devices known in the art.

In some embodiments the first half of an opening is drilled from wellbore A and then the second half of the opening is drilled from wellbore B through the first half of the opening. The drill bit may be pushed through to wellbore A and a first heater may be coupled to the drill bit to pull the first heater back through the opening and install the first heater in the opening. The first heater may be coupled to the drill bit using a connector such as a claw a catcher or other devices known in the art.

After the first heater is installed a tube or other guide may be placed in wellbore A and or wellbore B to guide drilling of a second opening. depicts a top view of an embodiment of heater A and drilling guide in wellbore . Drilling guide may be used to guide the drilling of the second opening in the formation and the installation of a second heater in the second opening. Insulator A may electrically and mechanically insulate heater A from drilling guide . Drilling guide and insulator A may protect heater A from being damaged while the second opening is being drilled and the second heater is being installed.

After the second heater is installed drilling guide may be placed in wellbore to guide drilling of a third opening as shown in . Drilling guide may be used to guide the drilling of the third opening in the formation and the installation of a third heater in the third opening. Insulators A and B may electrically and mechanically insulate heaters A and B respectively from drilling guide . Drilling guide and insulators A and B may protect heaters A and B from being damaged while the third opening is being drilled and the third heater is being installed. After the third heater is installed centralizer may be placed in wellbore to separate and space heaters A B C in the wellbore as shown in .

In some embodiments all the openings are formed in the formation and then the heaters are installed in the formation. In certain embodiments one of the openings is formed and one of the heaters is installed in the formation before the other openings are formed and the other heaters are installed. The first installed heater may be used as a guide during the formation of additional openings. The first installed heater may be energized to produce an electromagnetic field that is used to guide the formation of the other openings. For example the first installed heater may be energized with a bipolar DC current to magnetically guide drilling of the other openings.

In certain embodiments heaters A B C are coupled to a single three phase transformer at one end of the heaters as shown in . Heaters A B C may be electrically coupled in a triad configuration as described herein. In some embodiments two heaters are coupled together in a diad configuration as described herein. Transformer may be a three phase wye transformer. The heaters may each be coupled to one phase of transformer . Using three phase power to power the heaters may be more efficient than using single phase power. Using three phase connections for the heaters allows the magnetic fields of the heaters in wellbore A to cancel each other. The cancelled magnetic fields may allow overburden casing A to be ferromagnetic for example carbon steel in wellbore A. Using ferromagnetic casings in the wellbores may be less expensive and or easier to install than non ferromagnetic casings such as fiberglass casings .

In some embodiments the overburden section of heaters A B C are coated with an insulator such as a polymer or an enamel coating to inhibit shorting between the overburden sections of the heaters. In some embodiments only the overburden sections of the heaters in wellbore A are coated with the insulator as the heater sections in wellbore B may not have significant electrical losses. In some embodiments ends of heaters A B C in wellbore A are at least one diameter of the heaters away from overburden casing A so that no insulator is needed. The ends of heaters A B C may be for example centralized in wellbore A using a centralizer to keep the heaters the desired distance away from overburden casing A.

In some embodiments the ends of heaters A B C passing through wellbore B are electrically coupled together and grounded outside of the wellbore as shown in . The magnetic fields of the heaters may cancel each other in wellbore B. Thus overburden casing B may be ferromagnetic carbon steel in wellbore B. In certain embodiments the overburden section of heaters A B C are copper rods or tubulars. The build sections of the heaters the transition sections between the overburden sections and the heating sections may also be made of copper or similar electrically conductive material.

In some embodiments the ends of heaters A B C passing through wellbore B are electrically coupled together inside the wellbore. The ends of the heaters may be coupled inside the wellbore at or near the bottom of the overburden. Coupling the heaters together at or near the overburden reduces electrical losses in the overburden section of the wellbore.

Balls may be placed into the overburden section of wellbore B. Plate may allow balls to settle in the overburden section of wellbore B around heaters A B C. Balls may be made of electrically conductive material such as copper or nickel plated copper. Balls and plate may electrically couple heaters A B C to each other so that the heaters are grounded. In some embodiments portions of the heaters above plate the overburden sections of the heaters are made of carbon steel while portions of the heaters below the plate build sections of the heaters are made of copper.

In some embodiments heaters A B C as depicted in provide varying heat outputs along the lengths of the heaters. For example heaters A B C may have varying dimensions for example thicknesses or diameters along the lengths of the heater. The varying thicknesses may provide different electrical resistances along the length of the heater and thus different heat outputs along the length of the heaters.

In some embodiments heaters A B C are divided into two or more sections of heating. In some embodiments the heaters are divided into repeating sections of different heat outputs for example alternating sections of two different heat outputs that are repeated . The repeating sections of different heat outputs may be used in some embodiments to heat the formation in stages for example in a staged heating process as described herein . In one embodiment the halves of the heaters closest to wellbore A may provide heat in a first section of hydrocarbon layer and the halves of the heaters closest to wellbore B may provide heat in a second section of hydrocarbon layer . Hydrocarbons in the formation may be mobilized by the heat provided in the first section. Hydrocarbons in the second section may be heated to higher temperatures than the first section to upgrade the hydrocarbons in the second section for example the hydrocarbons may be further mobilized and or pyrolyzed . Hydrocarbons from the first section may move or be moved into the second section for the upgrading. For example a drive fluid may be provided through wellbore A to move the first section mobilized hydrocarbons to the second section.

In some embodiments more than three heaters extend from wellbore A and or B. If multiples of three heaters extend from the wellbores and are coupled to transformer the magnetic fields may cancel in the overburden sections of the wellbores as in the case of three heaters in the wellbores. For example six heaters may be coupled to transformer with two heaters coupled to each phase of the transformer to cancel the magnetic fields in the wellbores.

In some embodiments multiple heaters extend from one wellbore in different directions. depicts a schematic of an embodiment of multiple heaters extending in different directions from wellbore A. Heaters A B C may extend to wellbore B. Heaters D E F may extend to wellbore C in the opposite direction of heaters A B C. Heaters A B C and heaters D E F may be coupled to a single three phase transformer so that magnetic fields are cancelled in wellbore A.

In some embodiments heaters A B C may have different heat outputs from heaters D E F so that hydrocarbon layer is divided into two heating sections with different heating rates and or temperatures for example a mobilization and a pyrolyzation section . In some embodiments heaters A B C and or heaters D E F may have heat outputs that vary along the lengths of the heaters to further divide hydrocarbon layer into more heating sections. In some embodiments additional heaters may extend from wellbore B and or wellbore C to other wellbores in the formation as shown by the dashed lines in .

In some embodiments multiple levels of heaters extend between two wellbores. depicts a schematic of an embodiment of multiple levels of heaters extending between wellbore A and wellbore B. Heaters A B C may provide heat to a first level of hydrocarbon layer . Heaters D E F may branch off and provide heat to a second level of hydrocarbon layer . Heaters G H I may further branch off and provide heat to a third level of hydrocarbon layer . In some embodiments heaters A B C heaters D E F and heaters G H I provide heat to levels in the formation with different properties. For example the different groups of heaters may provide different heat outputs to levels with different properties in the formation so that the levels are heated at or about the same rate.

In some embodiments the levels are heated at different rates to create different heating zones in the formation. For example the first level heated by heaters A B C may be heated so that hydrocarbons are mobilized the second level heated by heaters D E F may be heated so that hydrocarbons are somewhat upgraded from the first level and the third level heated by heaters G H I may be heated to pyrolyze hydrocarbons. As another example the first level may be heated to create gases and or drive fluid in the first level and either the second level or the third level may be heated to mobilize and or pyrolyze fluids or just to a level to allow production in the level. In addition heaters A B C heaters D E F and or heaters G H I may have heat outputs that vary along the lengths of the heaters to further divide hydrocarbon layer into more heating sections.

In some embodiments electrical conductor is centralized inside tubular for example using centralizers or other support structures as shown in . Centralizers may electrically insulate electrical conductor from tubular . In some embodiments tubular contacts electrical conductor . For example tubular may hang drape or otherwise touch electrical conductor . In some embodiments electrical conductor includes electrical insulation for example magnesium oxide or porcelain enamel that insulates the current carrying portion of the electrical conductor from tubular . The electrical insulation inhibits current from flowing between the current carrying portion of electrical conductor and tubular if the electrical conductor and the tubular are in physical contact with each other.

In some embodiments electrical conductor is an exposed metal conductor heater or a conductor in conduit heater. In certain embodiments electrical conductor is an insulated conductor such as a mineral insulated conductor. The insulated conductor may have a copper core copper alloy core or a similar electrically conductive low resistance core that has low electrical losses. In some embodiments the core is a copper core with a diameter between about 0.5 1.27 cm and about 1 2.54 cm . The sheath or jacket of the insulated conductor may be a non ferromagnetic corrosion resistant steel such as 347 stainless steel 625 stainless steel 825 stainless steel 304 stainless steel or copper with a protective layer for example a protective cladding . The sheath may have an outer diameter of between about 1 2.54 cm and about 1.25 3.18 cm .

In some embodiments the sheath or jacket of the insulated conductor is in physical contact with the tubular for example the tubular is in physical contact with the sheath along the length of the tubular or the sheath is electrically connected to the tubular. In such embodiments the electrical insulation of the insulated conductor electrically insulates the core of the insulated conductor from the jacket and the tubular. depicts an embodiment of an induction heater with the sheath of an insulated conductor in electrical contact with tubular . Electrical conductor is the insulated conductor. The sheath of the insulated conductor is electrically connected to tubular using electrical contactors . In some embodiments electrical contactors are sliding contactors. In certain embodiments electrical contactors electrically connect the sheath of the insulated conductor to tubular at or near the ends of the tubular. Electrically connecting at or near the ends of tubular substantially equalizes the voltage along the tubular with the voltage along the sheath of the insulated conductor. Equalizing the voltages along tubular and along the sheath may inhibit arcing between the tubular and the sheath.

Tubular shown in and may be ferromagnetic or include ferromagnetic materials. Tubular may have a thickness such that when electrical conductor is energized with time varying current the electrical conductor induces electrical current flow on the surfaces of tubular due to the ferromagnetic properties of the tubular for example current flow is induced on both the inside of the tubular and the outside of the tubular . Current flow is induced in the skin depth of the surfaces of tubular so that the tubular operates as a skin effect heater. In certain embodiments the induced current circulates axially longitudinally on the inside and or outside surfaces of tubular . Longitudinal flow of current through electrical conductor induces primarily longitudinal current flow in tubular the majority of the induced current flow is in the longitudinal direction in the tubular . Having primarily longitudinal induced current flow in tubular may provide a higher resistance per foot than if the induced current flow is primarily angular current flow.

In certain embodiments current flow in tubular is induced with low frequency current in electrical conductor for example from 50 Hz or 60 Hz up to about 1000 Hz . In some embodiments induced currents on the inside and outside surfaces of tubular are substantially equal.

In certain embodiments tubular has a thickness that is greater than the skin depth of the ferromagnetic material in the tubular at or near the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material or at or near the phase transformation temperature of the ferromagnetic material. For example tubular may have a thickness of at least 2.1 at least 2.5 times at least 3 times or at least 4 times the skin depth of the ferromagnetic material in the tubular near the Curie temperature or the phase transformation temperature of the ferromagnetic material. In certain embodiments tubular has a thickness of at least 2.1 times at least 2.5 times at least 3 times or at least 4 times the skin depth of the ferromagnetic material in the tubular at about 50 C. below the Curie temperature or the phase transformation temperature of the ferromagnetic material.

In certain embodiments tubular is carbon steel. In some embodiments tubular is coated with a corrosion resistant coating for example porcelain or ceramic coating and or an electrically insulating coating. In some embodiments electrical conductor has an electrically insulating coating. Examples of the electrically insulating coating on tubular and or electrical conductor include but are not limited to a porcelain enamel coating alumina coating or alumina titania coating. In some embodiments tubular and or electrical conductor are coated with a coating such as polyethylene or another suitable low friction coefficient coating that may melt or decompose when the heater is energized. The coating may facilitate placement of the tubular and or the electrical conductor in the formation.

In some embodiments tubular includes corrosion resistant ferromagnetic material such as but not limited to 410 stainless steel 446 stainless steel T P91 stainless steel T P92 stainless steel alloy 52 alloy 42 and Invar 36. In some embodiments tubular is a stainless steel tubular with cobalt added for example between about 3 by weight and about 10 by weight cobalt added and or molybdenum for example about 0.5 molybdenum by weight .

At or near the Curie temperature or the phase transformation temperature of the ferromagnetic material in tubular the magnetic permeability of the ferromagnetic material decreases rapidly. When the magnetic permeability of tubular decreases at or near the Curie temperature or the phase transformation temperature there is little or no current flow in the tubular because at these temperatures the tubular is essentially non ferromagnetic and electrical conductor is unable to induce current flow in the tubular. With little or no current flow in tubular the temperature of the tubular will drop to lower temperatures until the magnetic permeability increases and the tubular becomes ferromagnetic. Thus tubular self limits at or near the Curie temperature or the phase transformation temperature and operates as a temperature limited heater due to the ferromagnetic properties of the ferromagnetic material in the tubular. Because current is induced in tubular the turndown ratio may be higher and the drop in current sharper for the tubular than for temperature limited heaters that apply current directly to the ferromagnetic material. For example heaters with current induced in tubular may have turndown ratios of at least about 5 at least about 10 or at least about 20 while temperature limited heaters that apply current directly to the ferromagnetic material may have turndown ratios that are at most about 5.

When current is induced in tubular the tubular provides heat to hydrocarbon layer and defines the heating zone in the hydrocarbon layer. In certain embodiments tubular heats to temperatures of at least about 300 C. at least about 500 C. or at least about 700 C. Because current is induced on both the inside and outside surfaces of tubular the heat generation of the tubular is increased as compared to temperature limited heaters that have current directly applied to the ferromagnetic material and current flow is limited to one surface. Thus less current may be provided to electrical conductor to generate the same heat as heaters that apply current directly to the ferromagnetic material. Using less current in electrical conductor decreases power consumption and reduces power losses in the overburden of the formation.

In certain embodiments tubulars have large diameters. The large diameters may be used to equalize or substantially equalize high pressures on the tubular from either the inside or the outside of the tubular. In some embodiments tubular has a diameter in a range between about 1.5 about 3.8 cm and about 5 about 12.7 cm . In some embodiments tubular has a diameter in a range between about 3 cm and about 13 cm between about 4 cm and about 12 cm or between about 5 cm and about 11 cm. Increasing the diameter of tubular may provide more heat output to the formation by increasing the heat transfer surface area of the tubular.

In some embodiments fluids flow through the annulus of tubular or through another conduit inside the tubular. The fluids may be used for example to cool down the heater to recover heat from the heater and or to initially heat the formation before energizing the heater.

In certain embodiments tubular has surfaces that are shaped to increase the resistance of the tubular. depicts an embodiment of a heater with tubular having radial grooved surfaces. Heater may include electrical conductors A B coupled to tubular . Electrical conductors A B may be insulated conductors. Electrical contactors may electrically and physically couple electrical conductors A B to tubular . In certain embodiments electrical contactors are attached to ends of electrical conductors A B. Electrical contactors have a shape such that when the ends of electrical conductors A B are pushed into the ends of tubular the electrical contactors physically and electrically couple the electrical conductors to the tubular. For example electrical contactors may be cone shaped.

In certain embodiments tubular includes grooves . Grooves may be formed as a part of the surface of tubular for example the tubular is formed with grooved surfaces or the grooves may be formed by adding or removing for example milling material on the surface of the tubular. For example grooves may be located on a piece of tubular that is welded to tubular .

In certain embodiments grooves are on the outer surface of tubular . In some embodiments the grooves are on the inner surface of the tubular. In some embodiments the grooves are on both the inner and outer surfaces of the tubular.

In certain embodiments grooves are radial grooves grooves that wrap around the circumference of tubular . In certain embodiments grooves are straight angled or spiral grooves or protrusions. In some embodiments grooves are evenly spaced grooves along the surface of tubular . In some embodiments grooves are part of a threaded surface on tubular the grooves are formed as a winding thread on the surface . Grooves may have a variety of shapes as desired. For example grooves may have square edges rectangular edges v shaped edges u shaped edges or have rounded edges.

Grooves increase the effective resistance of tubular by increasing the path length of induced current on the surface of the tubular. Grooves increase the effective resistance of tubular as compared to a tubular with the same inside and outside diameters with smooth surfaces. Because induced current travels axially the induced current has to travel up and down the grooves along the surface of the tubular. Thus the depth of grooves may be varied to provide a selected resistance in tubular . For example increasing the grooves depth increases the path length and the resistance.

Increasing the resistance of tubular with grooves increases the heat generation of the tubular as compared to a tubular with smooth surfaces. Thus the same electrical current in electrical conductor will provide more heat output in the radial grooved surface tubular than the smooth surface tubular. Therefore to provide the same heat output with the radial grooved surface tubular as the smooth surface tubular less current is needed in electrical conductor with the radial grooved surface tubular.

In some embodiments grooves are filled with materials that decompose at lower temperatures to protect the grooves during installation of tubular . For example grooves may be filled with polyethylene or asphalt. The polyethylene or asphalt may melt and or desorb when heater reaches normal operating temperatures of the heater.

Heater shown in generates heat when current is applied directly to tubular . Current is provided to tubular using electrical conductors A B. It is to be understood that grooves may be used in other embodiments of tubulars described herein to increase the resistance of such tubulars. For example grooves may be used in embodiments of tubulars depicted in and .

Providing different heat outputs along heater may provide different heating sections in one or more hydrocarbon layers. For example heater may be divided into two or more sections of heating to provide different heat outputs to different sections of a hydrocarbon layer and or different hydrocarbon layers.

In one embodiment a first portion of heater may provide heat to a first section of the hydrocarbon layer and a second portion of the heater may provide heat to a second section of the hydrocarbon layer. Hydrocarbons in the first section may be mobilized by the heat provided by the first portion of the eater. Hydrocarbons in the second section may be heated by the second portion of the heater to a higher temperature than the first section. The higher temperature in the second section may upgrade hydrocarbons in the second section relative to the first section. For example the hydrocarbons may be mobilized visbroken and or pyrolyzed in the second section. Hydrocarbons from the first section may be moved into the second section by for example a drive fluid provided to the first section. As another example heater may have end sections that provide higher heat outputs to counteract heat losses at the ends of the heater to maintain a more constant temperature in the heated portion of the formation.

In certain embodiments three or multiples of three electrical conductors enter and exit the formation through common wellbores with tubulars surrounding the electrical conductors in the portion of the formation to be heated. depicts an embodiment of three electrical conductors A B C entering the formation through first common wellbore A and exiting the formation through second common wellbore C with three tubulars A B C surrounding the electrical conductors in hydrocarbon layer . In some embodiments electrical conductors A B C are powered by a single three phase wye transformer. Tubulars A B C and portions of electrical conductors A B C may be in three separate wellbores in hydrocarbon layer for example three openings A B C depicted in . The three separate wellbores may be formed by drilling the wellbores from first common wellbore A to second common wellbore B vice versa or drilling from both common wellbores and connecting the drilled openings in the hydrocarbon layer.

Having multiple induction heaters extending from only two wellbores in hydrocarbon layer reduces the footprint of wells on the surface needed for heating the formation. The number of overburden wellbores drilled in the formation is reduced which reduces capital costs per heater in the formation. Power losses in the overburden may be a smaller fraction of total power supplied to the formation because of the reduced number of wells through the overburden used to treat the formation. In addition power losses in the overburden may be smaller because the three phases in the common wellbores substantially cancel each other and inhibit induced currents in the casings or other structures of the wellbores.

In some embodiments three or multiples of three electrical conductors and tubulars are located in separate wellbores in the formation. depicts an embodiment of three electrical conductors A B C and three tubulars A B C in separate wellbores in the formation. Electrical conductors A B C may be powered by single three phase wye transformer with each electrical conductor coupled to one phase of the transformer. In some embodiments the single three phase wye transformer is used to power 6 9 12 or other multiples of three of electrical conductors. Connecting multiples of three electrical conductors to the single three phase wye transformer may reduce equipment costs for providing power to the induction heaters.

In some embodiments two or multiples of two electrical conductors enter the formation from a first common wellbore and exit the formation from a second common wellbore with tubulars surrounding each electrical conductor in the hydrocarbon layer. The multiples of two electrical conductors may be powered by a single two phase transformer. In such embodiments the electrical conductors may be homogenous electrical conductors for example insulated conductors using the same materials throughout in the overburden sections and heating sections of the insulated conductor. The reverse flow of current in the overburden sections may reduce power losses in the overburden sections of the wellbores because the currents reduce or cancel inductive effects in the overburden sections.

In certain embodiments tubulars depicted in include multiple layers of ferromagnetic materials separated by electrical insulators. depicts an embodiment of a multilayered induction tubular. Tubular includes ferromagnetic layers A B C separated by electrical insulators A B. Three ferromagnetic layers and two layers of electrical insulators are shown in . Tubular may include additional ferromagnetic layers and or electrical insulators as desired. For example the number of layers may be chosen to provide a desired heat output from the tubular.

Ferromagnetic layers A B C are electrically insulated from electrical conductor by for example an air gap. Ferromagnetic layers A B C are electrically insulated from each other by electrical insulator A and electrical insulator B. Thus direct flow of current is inhibited between ferromagnetic layers A B C and electrical conductor . When current is applied to electrical conductor electrical current flow is induced in ferromagnetic layers A B C because of the ferromagnetic properties of the layers. Having two or more ferromagnetic layers provides multiple current induction loops for the induced current. The multiple current induction loops may effectively appear as electrical loads in series to a power source for electrical conductor . The multiple current induction loops may increase the heat generation per unit length of tubular as compared to a tubular with only one current induction loop. For the same heat output the tubular with multiple layers may have a higher voltage and lower current as compared to the single layer tubular.

In certain embodiments ferromagnetic layers A B C include the same ferromagnetic material. In some embodiments ferromagnetic layers A B C include different ferromagnetic materials. Properties of ferromagnetic layers A B C may be varied to provide different heat outputs from the different layers. Examples of properties of ferromagnetic layers A B C that may be varied include but are not limited to ferromagnetic material and thicknesses of the layers.

Electrical insulators A and B may be magnesium oxide porcelain enamel and or another suitable electrical insulator. The thicknesses and or materials of electrical insulators A and B may be varied to provide different operating parameters for tubular .

In some embodiments fluids are circulated through tubulars depicted in . In some embodiments fluids are circulated through the tubulars to add heat to the formation. For example fluids may be circulated through the tubulars to preheat the formation prior to energizing the tubulars providing current to the heating system . In some embodiments fluids are circulated through the tubulars to recover heat from the formation. The recovered heat may be used to provide heat to other portions of the formation and or surface processes used to treat fluids produced from the formation.

In certain embodiments insulated conductors are operated as induction heaters. depicts a cross sectional end view of an embodiment of insulated conductor that is used as an induction heater. depicts a cross sectional side view of the embodiment of depicted in . Insulated conductor includes core electrical insulator and jacket . Core may be copper or another non ferromagnetic electrical conductor with low resistance that provides little or no heat output. Electrical insulator is magnesium oxide or another suitable electrical insulator that inhibits arcing at high voltages.

Jacket includes at least one ferromagnetic material. In certain embodiments jacket includes carbon steel or another ferromagnetic steel for example 410 stainless steel 446 stainless steel T P91 stainless steel T P92 stainless steel alloy 52 alloy 42 and Invar 36 . In some embodiments jacket includes an outer layer of corrosion resistant material for example stainless steel such as 347H stainless steel or 304 stainless steel . The outer layer may be clad to the ferromagnetic material or otherwise coupled to the ferromagnetic material using methods known in the art.

In certain embodiments jacket has a thickness of at least about 2 skin depths of the ferromagnetic material in the jacket. In some embodiments jacket has a thickness of at least about 3 skin depths at least about 4 skin depths or at least about 5 skin depths. Increasing the thickness of jacket may increase the heat output from insulated conductor .

In one embodiment core is copper with a diameter of about 0.5 1.27 cm electrical insulator is magnesium oxide with a thickness of about 0.20 0.5 cm the outside diameter is about 0.9 2.3 cm and jacket is carbon steel with an outside diameter of about 1.6 4.1 cm the thickness is about 0.35 0.88 cm . A thin layer about 0.1 0.25 cm thickness outside diameter of about 1.7 4.3 cm of corrosion resistant material 347H stainless steel may be clad on the outside of jacket .

In another embodiment core is copper with a diameter of about 0.338 0.86 cm electrical insulator is magnesium oxide with a thickness of about 0.096 0.24 cm the outside diameter is about 0.53 1.3 cm and jacket is carbon steel with an outside diameter of about 1.13 2.9 cm the thickness is about 0.30 0.76 cm . A thin layer about 0.065 0.17 cm thickness outside diameter of about 1.26 3.2 cm of corrosion resistant material 347H stainless steel may be clad on the outside of jacket .

In another embodiment core is copper electrical insulator is magnesium oxide and jacket is a thin layer of copper surrounded by carbon steel. Core electrical insulator and the thin copper layer of jacket may be obtained as a single piece of insulated conductor. Such insulated conductors may be obtained as long pieces of insulated conductors for example lengths of about 500 about 150 m or more . The carbon steel layer of jacket may be added by drawing down the carbon steel over the long insulated conductor. Such an insulated conductor may only generate heat on the outside of jacket as the thin copper layer in the jacket shorts to the inside surface of the jacket.

In some embodiments jacket is made of multiple layers of ferromagnetic material. The multiple layers may be the same ferromagnetic material or different ferromagnetic materials. For example in one embodiment jacket is a 0.35 0.88 cm thick carbon steel jacket made from three layers of carbon steel. The first and second layers are 0.10 0.25 cm thick and the third layer is 0.15 0.38 cm thick. In another embodiment jacket is a 0.3 0.76 cm thick carbon steel jacket made from three 0.10 0.25 cm thick layers of carbon steel.

In certain embodiments jacket and core are electrically insulated such that there is no direct electrical connection between the jacket and the core. Core may be electrically coupled to a single power source with each end of the core being coupled to one pole of the power source. For example insulated conductor may be a u shaped heater located in a u shaped wellbore with each end of core being coupled to one pole of the power source.

When core is energized with time varying current the core induces electrical current flow on the surfaces of jacket as shown by the arrows in due to the ferromagnetic properties of the ferromagnetic material in the jacket. In certain embodiments current flow is induced on both the inside and outside surfaces of jacket . In these induction heater embodiments jacket operates as the heating element of insulated conductor .

At or near the Curie temperature or the phase transformation temperature of the ferromagnetic material in jacket the magnetic permeability of the ferromagnetic material decreases rapidly. When the magnetic permeability of jacket decreases at or near the Curie temperature or the phase transformation temperature there is little or no current flow in the jacket because at these temperatures the jacket is essentially non ferromagnetic and core is unable to induce current flow in the tubular. With little or no current flow in jacket the temperature of the jacket will drop to lower temperatures until the magnetic permeability increases and the jacket becomes ferromagnetic. Thus jacket self limits at or near the Curie temperature or the phase transformation temperature and insulated conductor operates as a temperature limited heater due to the ferromagnetic properties of the jacket. Because current is induced in jacket the turndown ratio may be higher and the drop in current sharper for the jacket than if current is directly applied to the jacket.

In certain embodiments portions of jacket in the overburden of the formation do not include ferromagnetic material for example are non ferromagnetic . Having the overburden portions of jacket made of non ferromagnetic material inhibits current induction in the overburden portions of the jackets. Power losses in the overburden are inhibited or reduced by inhibiting current induction in the overburden portions.

As shown in core A and core B are coupled to transformer and terminal block . Thus core A and core B are electrically coupled in series such that current in core A flows in an opposite direction from current in core B as shown by the arrows in . Current flow in cores A B induces current flow in jackets A B respectively as shown by the arrows in .

In certain embodiments portions of jacket A and or jacket B are coated with an electrically insulating coating for example a porcelain enamel coating alumina coating and or alumina titania coating . The electrically insulating coating may inhibit the currents in one jacket from affecting current in the other jacket or vice versa for example current in one jacket cancelling out current in the other jacket . Electrically insulating the jackets from each other may inhibit the turndown ratio of the heater from being reduced by the interaction of induced currents in the jackets.

Because core A and core B are electrically coupled in series to a single transformer transformer insulated conductor may be located in a wellbore that terminates in the formation for example a wellbore with a single surface opening such as an L shaped or J shaped wellbore . Insulated conductor as depicted in may be operated as a subsurface termination induction heater with electrical connections between the heater and the power source the transformer being made through one surface opening.

Portions of jackets A B in the overburden of the formation may be non ferromagnetic to inhibit induction currents in the overburden portion of the jackets. Inhibiting induction currents in the overburden portion of the jackets inhibits inductive heating and or power losses in the overburden. Induction effects in other structures in the overburden that surround insulated conductor for example overburden casings may be inhibited because the current in core A flows in an opposite direction from the current in core B.

Jacket A and jacket B are electrically insulated from core and each other by electrical insulator A and electrical insulator B. Thus direct flow of current is inhibited between jacket A and jacket B and core . When current is applied to core electrical current flow is induced in both jacket A and jacket B because of the ferromagnetic properties of the jackets. Having two or more layers of electrical insulators and jackets provides multiple current induction loops. The multiple current induction loops may effectively appear as electrical loads in series to a power source for insulated conductor . The multiple current induction loops may increase the heat generation per unit length of insulated conductor as compared to an insulated conductor with only one current induction loop. For the same heat output the insulated conductor with multiple layers may have a higher voltage and lower current as compared to the single layer insulated conductor.

In certain embodiments jacket A and jacket B include the same ferromagnetic material. In some embodiments jacket A and jacket B include different ferromagnetic materials. Properties of jacket A and jacket B may be varied to provide different heat outputs from the different layers. Examples of properties of jacket A and jacket B that may be varied include but are not limited to ferromagnetic material and thicknesses of the layers.

Electrical insulators A and B may be magnesium oxide porcelain enamel and or another suitable electrical insulator. The thicknesses and or materials of electrical insulators A and B may be varied to provide different operating parameters for insulated conductor .

As shown in insulated conductors are located in tubular . Tubular may be a coiled tubing conduit or other coiled tubing tubular or casing. Insulated conductors may be in a spiral or helix formation inside tubular to reduce stresses on the insulated conductors when the insulated conductors are coiled for example on a coiled tubing reel. Tubular allows the insulated conductors to be installed in the formation using a coiled tubing rig and protects the insulated conductors during installation into the formation.

As shown in insulated conductors are coupled to support member . Support member provides support for insulated conductors . Insulated conductors may be wrapped around support member in a spiral or helix formation. In some embodiments support member includes ferromagnetic material. Current flow may be induced in the ferromagnetic material of support member . Thus support member may generate some heat in addition to the heat generated in the jackets of insulated conductors .

In certain embodiments insulated conductors are held together on support member with band . Band may be stainless steel or another non corrosive material. In some embodiments band includes a plurality of bands that hold together insulated conductors . The bands may be periodically placed around insulated conductors to hold the conductors together.

In some embodiments jacket depicted in or jackets A B depicted in include grooves or other structures on the outer surface and or the inner surface of the jacket to increase the effective resistance of the jacket. Increasing the resistance of jacket and or jackets A B with grooves increases the heat generation of the jackets as compared to jackets with smooth surfaces. Thus the same electrical current in core and or cores A B will provide more heat output in the grooved surface jackets than the smooth surface jackets.

In some embodiments jacket depicted in or jackets A B depicted in are divided into sections to provide varying heat outputs along the length of the heaters. For example jacket and or jackets A B may be divided into sections such as tubular sections A B and C depicted in . The sections of the jackets depicted in and may have different properties to provide different heat outputs in each section. Examples of properties that may be varied include but are not limited to thicknesses diameters resistances materials number of grooves depth of grooves. The different properties in the sections may provide different maximum operating temperatures for example different Curie temperatures or phase transformation temperatures along the length of insulated conductor . The different maximum temperatures of the sections provides different heat outputs from the sections.

In some embodiments portions of casings in the overburden sections of heater wellbores have surfaces that are shaped to increase the effective diameter of the casing. Casings in the overburden sections of heater wellbores may include but not be limited to overburden casings heater casings heater tubulars and or jackets of insulated conductors. Increasing the effective diameter of the casing may reduce inductive effects in the casing when current used to power heater s below the overburden is transmitted through the casing for example when one phase of power is being transmitted through the overburden section . When current is transmitted in only one direction through the overburden the current may induce other currents in ferromagnetic or other electrically conductive materials such as those found in overburden casings. These induced currents may provide undesired power losses and or undesired heating in the overburden of the formation.

In certain embodiments grooves are on the outer surface of casing . In some embodiments grooves are on the inner surface of casing . In some embodiments grooves are on both the inner and outer surfaces of casing .

In certain embodiments grooves are axial grooves grooves that go longitudinally along the length of casing . In certain embodiments grooves are straight angled or longitudinally spiral grooves or protrusions. In some embodiments grooves are substantially axial grooves or spiral grooves with a significant longitudinal component. In some embodiments grooves extend substantially axially along the length of casing . In some embodiments grooves are evenly spaced grooves along the surface of casing . Grooves may have a variety of shapes as desired. For example grooves may have square edges v shaped edges u shaped edges rectangular edges or have rounded edges.

Grooves increase the effective circumference of casing . Grooves increase the effective circumference of casing as compared to the circumference of a casing with the same inside and outside diameters and smooth surfaces. The depth of grooves may be varied to provide a selected effective circumference of casing . For example axial grooves that are wide and deep and spaced apart may increase the effective circumference of a 6 15.24 cm diameter pipe from 18.84 47.85 cm to 37.68 95.71 cm or the circumference of a 12 30.48 cm diameter pipe .

In certain embodiments grooves increase the effective circumference of casing by a factor of at least about 2 as compared to a casing with the same inside and outside diameters and smooth surfaces. In some embodiments grooves increase the effective circumference of casing by a factor of at least about 3 at least about 4 or at least about 6 as compared to a casing with the same inside and outside diameters and smooth surfaces.

Increasing the effective circumference of casing with grooves increases the surface area of the casing. Increasing the surface area of casing reduces the induced current in the casing for a given current flux. Power losses associated with inductive heating in casing are reduced as compared to a casing with smooth surfaces because of the reduce induced current. Thus the same electrical current will provide less heat output from inductive heating in the axial grooved surface casing than the smooth surface casing. Reducing the heat output in the overburden section of the heater will increase the efficiency of and reduce the costs associated with operating the heater. Increasing the effective circumference of casing and reducing inductive effects in the casing allows the casing to be made with less expensive materials such as carbon steel.

In some embodiments an electrically insulating coating for example a porcelain enamel coating is placed on one or more surfaces of casing to inhibit current and or power losses from the casing. In some embodiments casing is formed from two or more longitudinal sections of casing for example longitudinal sections welded or threaded together end to end . The longitudinal sections may be aligned so that the grooves on the sections are aligned. Aligning the sections may allow for cement or other material to flow along the grooves.

In some embodiments an insulated conductor heater is placed in the formation by itself and the outside of the insulated conductor heater is electrically isolated from the formation because the heater has little or no voltage potential on the outside of the heater. depicts an embodiment of a single ended substantially horizontal insulated conductor heater that electrically isolates itself from the formation. In such an embodiment heater is insulated conductor . Insulated conductor may be a mineral insulated conductor heater for example insulated conductor depicted in . Insulated conductor is located in opening in hydrocarbon layer . In certain embodiments opening is an uncased or open wellbore. In some embodiments opening is a cased or lined wellbore. In some embodiments insulated conductor heater is a substantially u shaped heater and is located in a substantially u shaped opening.

Insulated conductor has little or no current flowing along the outside surface of the insulated conductor so that the insulated conductor is electrically isolated from the formation and leaks little or no current into the formation. The outside surface or jacket of insulated conductor is a metal or thermal radiating body so that heat is radiated from the insulated conductor to the formation.

In the embodiment depicted in core brings current into the formation as shown by the arrow. Core and jacket are electrically coupled at the distal end bottom of the heater. Current returns to the surface of the formation through jacket . The ferromagnetic properties of jacket confine the current to the skin depth along the inside diameter of the jacket as shown by arrows in . Jacket has a thickness at least 2 or 3 times the skin depth of the ferromagnetic material used in the jacket at 25 C. and at the design current frequency so that most of the current is confined to the inside surface of the jacket and little or no current flows on the outside diameter of the jacket. Thus there is little or no voltage potential on the outside of jacket . Having little or no voltage potential on the outside surface of insulated conductor does not expose the formation to any high voltages inhibits current leakage to the formation and reduces or eliminates the need for isolation transformers which decrease energy efficiency.

Because core is made of a highly conductive material such as copper and jacket is made of more resistive ferromagnetic material a majority of the heat generated by insulated conductor is generated in the jacket. Generating the majority of the heat in jacket increases the efficiency of heat transfer from insulated conductor to the formation over an insulated conductor or other heater that uses a core or a center conductor to generate the majority of the heat.

In certain embodiments core is made of copper. Using copper in core allows the heating section of the heater and the overburden section to have identical core materials. Thus the heater may be made from one long core assembly. The long single core assembly reduces or eliminates the need for welding joints in the core which can be unreliable and susceptible to failure. Additionally the long single core assembly heater may be manufactured remote from the installation site and transported in a final assembly ready to install assembly to the installation site. The single core assembly also allows for long heater lengths for example about 1000 m or longer depending on the breakdown voltage of the electrical insulator.

In certain embodiments jacket is made from two or more layers of the same materials and or different materials. Jacket may be formed from two or more layers to achieve thicknesses needed for the jacket for example to have a thickness at least 3 times the skin depth of the ferromagnetic material used in the jacket at 25 C. and at the design current frequency . Manufacturing and or material limitations may limit the thickness of a single layer of jacket material. For example the amount each layer can be strained during manufacturing forming the layer on the heater may limit the thickness of each layer. Thus to reach jacket thicknesses needed for certain embodiments of insulated conductor jacket may be formed from several layers of jacket material. For example three layers of T P92 stainless steel may be used to form jacket with a thickness of about 3 times the skin depth of the T P92 stainless steel at 25 C. and at the design current frequency.

In some embodiments jacket includes two or more different materials. In some embodiments jacket includes different materials in different layers of the jacket. For example jacket may have one or more inner layers of ferromagnetic material chosen for their electrical and or electromagnetic properties and one or more outer layers chosen for its non corrosive properties.

In some embodiments the thickness of jacket and or the material of the jacket are varied along the heater length. The thickness and or material of jacket may be varied to vary electrical properties and or mechanical properties along the length of the heater. For example the thickness and or material of jacket may be varied to vary the turndown ratio or the Curie temperature along the length of the heater. In some embodiments the inner layer of jacket includes copper or other highly conductive metals in the overburden section of the heater. The inner layer of copper limits heat losses in the overburden section of the heater.

In certain embodiments core is copper electrical insulator is magnesium oxide and jacket is non ferromagnetic stainless steel for example 347H stainless steel 204 Cu stainless steel or 204 M stainless steel . Insulated conductor may be placed in tubular to protect the insulated conductor increase heat transfer to the formation and or allow for coiled tubing or continuous installation of the insulated conductor. Tubular may be made of ferromagnetic material such as 410 stainless steel T P91 stainless steel or carbon steel. In certain embodiments tubular is made of corrosion resistant materials. In some embodiments tubular is made of non ferromagnetic materials.

In certain embodiments jacket of insulated conductor is longitudinally welded to tubular along weld joint as shown in . The longitudinal weld may be a laser weld a tandem GTAW gas tungsten arc welding weld or an electron beam weld that welds the surface of jacket to tubular . In some embodiments tubular is made from a longitudinal strip of metal. Tubular may be made by rolling the longitudinal strip to form a cylindrical tube and then welding the longitudinal ends of the strip together to make the tubular.

In certain embodiments insulated conductor is welded to tubular as the longitudinal ends of the strip are welded together in the same welding process . For example insulated conductor is placed along one of the longitudinal ends of the strip so that jacket is welded to tubular at the location where the ends are welded together. In some embodiments insulated conductor is welded to one of the longitudinal ends of the strip before the strip is rolled to form the cylindrical tube. The ends of the strip may then be welded to form tubular .

In some embodiments insulated conductor is welded to tubular at another location for example at a circumferential location away from the weld joining the ends of the strip used to form the tubular . For example jacket of insulated conductor may be welded to tubular diametrically opposite from where the longitudinal ends of the strip used to form the tubular are welded. In some embodiments tubular is made of multiple strips of material that are rolled together and coupled for example welded to form the tubular with a desired thickness. Using more than one strip of metal may be easier to roll into the cylindrical tube used to form the tubular.

Jacket and tubular may be electrically and mechanically coupled at weld joint . Longitudinally welding jacket to tubular inhibits arcing between insulated conductor and the tubular. Tubular may return electrical current from core along the inside of the tubular if the tubular is ferromagnetic. If tubular is non ferromagnetic a thin electrically insulating layer such as a porcelain enamel coating or a spray coated ceramic may be put on the outside of the tubular to inhibit current leakage from the tubular into the formation. In some embodiments a fluid is placed in tubular to increase heat transfer between insulated conductor and the tubular and or to inhibit arcing between the insulated conductor and the tubular. Examples of fluids include but are not limited to thermally conductive gases such as helium carbon dioxide or steam. Fluids may also include fluids such as oil molten metals or molten salts for example solar salt 60 NaNO 40 KNO . In some embodiments heat transfer fluids are transported inside tubular and heated inside the tubular in the space between the tubular and insulated conductor . In some embodiments an optical fiber thermocouple or other temperature sensor is placed inside tubular .

In certain embodiments the heater depicted in and is energized with AC current or time varying electrical current . A majority of the heat is generated in tubular when the heater is energized with AC current. If tubular is ferromagnetic and the wall thickness of the tubular is at least about twice the skin depth at 25 C. and at the design current frequency then the heater will operate as a temperature limited heater. Generating the majority of the heat in tubular improves heat transfer to the formation as compared to a heater that generates a majority of the heat in the insulated conductor.

In some embodiments an optical fiber thermocouple or other temperature sensor is placed inside tubular .

In certain embodiments the heater depicted in and is energized with AC current or time varying electrical current . A majority of the heat is generated in tubular when the heater is energized with AC current. If tubular is ferromagnetic and the wall thickness of the tubular is at least about twice the skin depth at a temperature near the Curie temperature for example 50 C. below the Curie temperature then the heater will operate as a temperature limited heater. Generating the majority of the heat in tubular improves heat transfer to the formation as compared to a heater that generates a majority of the heat in the insulated conductor.

In certain embodiments portions of the wellbore that extend through the overburden include casings. The casings may include materials that inhibit inductive effects in the casings. Inhibiting inductive effects in the casings may inhibit induced currents in the casing and or reduce heat losses to the overburden. In some embodiments the overburden casings may include non metallic materials such as fiberglass polyvinylchloride PVC chlorinated PVC CPVC high density polyethylene HDPE high temperature polymers such as nitrogen based polymers or other high temperature plastics. HDPEs with working temperatures in a usable range include HDPEs available from Dow Chemical Co. Inc. Midland Mich. U.S.A. . The overburden casings may be made of materials that are spoolable so that the overburden casings can be spooled into the wellbore. In some embodiments overburden casings may include non magnetic metals such as aluminum or non magnetic alloys such as manganese steels having at least 10 manganese iron aluminum alloys with at least 18 aluminum or austentitic stainless steels such as 304 stainless steel or 316 stainless steel. In some embodiments overburden casings may include carbon steel or other ferromagnetic material coupled on the inside diameter to a highly conductive non ferromagnetic metal for example copper or aluminum to inhibit inductive effects or skin effects. In some embodiments overburden casings are made of inexpensive materials that may be left in the formation sacrificial casings .

In certain embodiments wellheads for the wellbores may be made of one or more non ferromagnetic materials. depicts an embodiment of wellhead . The components in the wellheads may include fiberglass PVC CPVC HDPE high temperature polymers such as nitrogen based polymers and or non magnetic alloys or metals. Some materials such as polymers may be extruded into a mold or reaction injection molded RIM into the shape of the wellhead. Forming the wellhead from a mold may be a less expensive method of making the wellhead and save in capital costs for providing wellheads to a treatment site. Using non ferromagnetic materials in the wellhead may inhibit undesired heating of components in the wellhead. Ferromagnetic materials used in the wellhead may be electrically and or thermally insulated from other components of the wellhead. In some embodiments an inert gas for example nitrogen or argon is purged inside the wellhead and or inside of casings to inhibit reflux of heated gases into the wellhead and or the casings.

In some embodiments ferromagnetic materials in the wellhead are electrically coupled to a non ferromagnetic material for example copper to inhibit skin effect heat generation in the ferromagnetic materials in the wellhead. The non ferromagnetic material is in electrical contact with the ferromagnetic material so that current flows through the non ferromagnetic material. In certain embodiments as shown in non ferromagnetic material is coupled and electrically coupled to the inside walls of conduit and wellhead walls . In some embodiments copper may be plasma sprayed coated clad or lined on the inside and or outside walls of the wellhead. In some embodiments a non ferromagnetic material such as copper is welded brazed clad or otherwise electrically coupled to the inside and or outside walls of the wellhead. For example copper may be swaged out to line the inside walls in the wellhead. Copper may be liquid nitrogen cooled and then allowed to expand to contact and swage against the inside walls of the wellhead. In some embodiments the copper is hydraulically expanded or explosively bonded to contact against the inside walls of the wellhead.

In some embodiments two or more substantially horizontal wellbores are branched off of a first substantially vertical wellbore drilled downwards from a first location on a surface of the formation. The substantially horizontal wellbores may be substantially parallel through a hydrocarbon layer. The substantially horizontal wellbores may reconnect at a second substantially vertical wellbore drilled downwards at a second location on the surface of the formation. Having multiple wellbores branching off of a single substantially vertical wellbore drilled downwards from the surface reduces the number of openings made at the surface of the formation.

In certain embodiments a horizontal heater or a heater at an incline is installed in more than one part. depicts an embodiment of heater that has been installed in two parts. Heater includes heating section A and lead in section B. Heating section A may be located horizontally or at an incline in a hydrocarbon layer in the formation. Lead in section B may be the overburden section or low resistance section of the heater for example the section of the heater with little or no electrical heat output .

During installation of heater heating section A may be installed first into the formation. Heating section A may be installed by pushing the heating section into the opening in the formation using a drill pipe or other installation tool that pushes the heating section into the opening. After installation of heating section A the installation tool may be removed from the opening in the formation. Installing only heating section A with the installation tool at this time may allow the heating section to be installed further into the formation than if the heating section and the lead in section are installed together because a higher compressive strength may be applied to the heating section alone the installation tool only has to push in the horizontal or inclined direction .

In some embodiments heating section A is coupled to mechanical connector . Connector may be used to hold heating section A in the opening. In some embodiments connector includes copper or other electrically conductive materials so that the connector is used as an electrical connector for example as an electrical ground . In some embodiments connector is used to couple heating section A to a bus bar or electrical return rod located in an opening perpendicular to the opening of the heating section.

Lead in section B may be installed after installation of heating section A. Lead in section B may be installed with a drill pipe or other installation tool. In some embodiments the installation tool may be the same tool used to install heating section A.

Lead in section B may couple to heating section A as the lead in section is installed into the opening. In certain embodiments coupling joint is used to couple lead in section B to heating section A. Coupling joint may be located on either lead in section B or heating section A. In some embodiments coupling joint includes portions located on both sections. Coupling joint may be a coupler such as but not limited to a wet connect or wet stab. In some embodiments heating section A includes a catcher or other tool that guides an end of lead in section B to form coupling joint .

In some embodiments coupling joint includes a container for example a can located on heating section A that accepts the end of lead in section B. Electrically conductive beads for example balls spheres or pebbles may be located in the container. The beads may move around as the end of lead in section B is pushed into the container to make electrical contact between the lead in section and heating section A. The beads may be made of for example copper or aluminum. The beads may be coated or covered with a corrosion inhibitor such as nickel. In some embodiments the beads are coated with a solder material that melts at lower temperatures for example below the boiling point of water in the formation . A high electrical current may be applied to the container to melt the solder. The melted solder may flow and fill void spaces in the container and be allowed to solidify before energizing the heater. In some embodiments sacrificial beads are put in the container. The sacrificial beads may corrode first so that copper or aluminum beads in the container are less likely to be corroded during operation of the heater.

Continuous tubulars such as coil tubing have been used for many years. Running continuous tubulars into and or out of a wellbore may be simpler and faster than running tubing formed of conventional jointed pipe.

Continuous tubulars may be run into and or out of wellbores using injectors. Injectors may force the continuous tubulars into the wells through a lubricator assembly or stuffing box to overcome any well pressure until the weight of the continuous tubulars exceeds the force applied by the well pressure that acts against the cross sectional area of the continuous tubulars. Once the weight of the continuous tubular overcomes the pressure the continuous tubular may need to be supported by the injector. The process may be reversed as the continuous tubular is removed from the well.

A method for running dual jointed tubing strings into and out of wells is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 474 236 to Kellett which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. Kellett describes a method and apparatus for completing a well using jointed production and service strings of different diameters. The method includes steps of running the production string on a main tubing string hanger while maintaining control with a variable bore blowout preventer and running the service string into the main tubing string hanger while maintaining control with a dual bore blowout preventer.

Continuous tubulars have been used for various well treatment processes such as fracturing acidizing and gravel packing. Typically several thousand feet of flexible seamless tubing is coiled onto a large reel that is mounted on a truck or skid. A continuous tubular injector with a chain track drive or equivalent may be mounted above the wellhead. The continuous tubular may be fed to the injector for injection into the well. The continuous tubular may be straightened as it is removed from the reel by a continuous tubular guide that aligns the continuous tubular with the wellbore and the injector mechanism.

The use of dual continuous tubulars for well servicing and production is known in the art. Recent developments in well completion and well workover have demonstrated the utility of using two continuous tubulars concurrently for many downhole operations. A difficulty with injecting dual continuous tubulars into a wellbore is the proximity of the respective continuous tubulars and the lack of working space to deploy a pair of continuous tubular injector assemblies mounted above the wellhead. This problem was apparently resolved with a coil tubing string injector assembly adapted to simultaneously inject dual string coil tubing into a wellbore as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 516 891 to Dallas which is incorporated herein by reference.

Another problem associated with the injection of dual continuous tubulars into a wellbore is the prevention of fluid leakage during the injection of the dual continuous tubulars especially when a long downhole tool is connected to one or both of the continuous tubulars. Downhole tools typically have a larger diameter than the continuous tubular and cannot be plastically deformed which presents certain difficulties. It is known in the art how to overcome these difficulties while injecting a single continuous tubular. For example U.S. Pat. No. 4 940 095 to Newman which is incorporated herein by reference discloses a method of inserting a well service tool connected to a coiled tubing string which avoids the high and or remote mounting of a heavy coiled tubing injector drive mechanism. A closed end lubricator is used to house the tool until it is run down through a blowout preventer connected to a top of the well. The pipe rams of the blowout preventer are closed around the tool to support it while a tubing injector is mounted to the wellhead and the coil tubing string is connected to the tool. The blowout preventer is then opened and the coil tubing string injector is used to run the tool into the well. However Newman fails to address the use of dual string continuous tubulars.

Many subsurface wells are fitted with permanent sensors such as pressure and temperature sensors which require electrical power to transmit signals from the sensors to a remote point at the surface. Subsurface wells may employ subsurface equipment such as pumps or heaters which may also require electrical power. To supply power to these subsurface pieces of equipment electric current from a source outside of the wellhead must be transferred through the wellhead to the electrically responsive device. Electrical power can be supplied downhole by several methods. These methods include but are not limited to electrical umbilical cords rigid tubular conductors or coiled tubing. The power supply may be transferred through either the tubing hanger or the casing hanger.

The extreme environmental conditions inside the wellhead coupled with the rough nature of completion operations may cause damage to devices used to supply electrical power. Damaged equipment may potentially lead to electrical short circuits that can present a hazard to persons working around the wellhead. Since the majority of wellhead equipment is constructed of conductive materials an electrical short inside of the wellhead may charge the outer surface of the wellhead. Unprotected persons may be exposed to electrical shock if contact is made with the wellhead s outer surface. Continuous tubulars subjected to electrical charge for example heaters may be insulated from the wellhead of the wellbore.

Typically a continuous tubular is inserted into a wellhead through a lubricator assembly or a stuffing box because there is a pressure differential between the wellbore and atmosphere. The pressure differential may be naturally or artificially created. The pressure differential may produce oil gas or a mixture thereof from the pressurized well. Wellhead mechanisms may inhibit movement of continuous tubulars upward and out of the wellbore as well as inhibit downward movement into the wellbore.

In certain embodiments a suspension mechanism is capable of suspending dual continuous tubulars for example dual insulated conductor heaters . In some embodiments the suspension mechanism includes slips or special fittings. With slips a radial gripping force keeps dual continuous tubulars suspended and inhibits downward movement. In some embodiments the slips inhibit upward movement for example upward movement of the dual continuous tubulars . Inhibiting upward movement may be accomplished by using a reverse slip arrangement. Conventional wellheads and hangers may not be designed to restrain movement of continuous tubulars in the upward direction. Instead conventional wellheads and hangers may be only designed to suspend the strings due to the gravitational load of the continuous tubulars.

Deployment and suspension of continuous tubulars in the wellbore may require a mechanism that suspends the dual continuous tubulars in the wellhead by some suitable hanging mechanism or hanger. The hanging suspension mechanisms may function when the dual legs of the continuous tubulars are deployed simultaneously. Conventionally dual continuous tubulars are not deployed simultaneously. In some embodiments a suspension mechanism is able to suspend the vertical downward load of both the tubulars as well as inhibit the upward movement of the tubulars.

The wellhead and the suspension mechanism may include one or more seals . Seals may inhibit wellbore fluids from migrating upwards. Seals may help maintain a desired pressure in the wellbore. Wellcap keeps the suspension mechanism in place and inhibits upward movement. Wellhead may include an opening in which the suspension mechanism is positioned. The opening may narrow to a diameter less than that of the suspension mechanism to inhibit downward movement of the suspension mechanism.

In some embodiments inhibitors include coatings. The coating may impart specific desirable properties to the inhibitor to which the coating is applied. For example a coating may include a temperature resistant polymer coating.

Suspension mechanism may include lower portion A and upper portion B. Upper portion B may include at least two openings with diameters large enough to allow passage of the tubulars at both ends of each opening but small enough at the proximal ends of the openings to inhibit passage of upper inhibitors B in an upward direction. The distal ends of the openings may be large enough to allow the upper inhibitors to sit within the openings of the upper portion B of suspension mechanism . Lower portion A may include at least two openings with diameters large enough to allow passage of the tubulars at both ends of the openings but small enough at the distal end of each opening to inhibit passage of lower inhibitors A in a downward direction. The proximal ends of the openings may be large enough to allow the lower inhibitors to sit within the openings of lower portion A of suspension mechanism .

Suspension mechanism may include locks . In some embodiments locks are screws bolts or other types of fasteners. Locks inhibit movement of one or more portions of suspension mechanism within wellhead . Wellhead may include an opening in which suspension mechanism is positioned. The opening may narrow to a diameter less than that of suspension mechanism to inhibit downward movement of the suspension mechanism.

In some embodiments the above operation is done in a false wellhead housing not shown just above the wellhead after the inhibitors are tightened together the tubulars are lifted until they clear the false wellhead which is then removed. The tubulars along with the suspension mechanism are lowered into a wellhead housing and the load is transferred to the shoulder for example a protrusion or narrowing of the opening in the wellhead which inhibits movement of the suspension mechanism beyond the protrusion . The locks are tightened to inhibit movement of the suspension mechanism relative to the wellhead.

In some embodiments lower portion A may include a tapered opening extending through it. The lower portion may include a carrier with a tapered shape complementary to the tapered opening in the lower portion. The carrier may sit within the tapered opening of the lower portion. Inhibitors A fit in complementary tapered openings through the carrier. The load of the tubulars once positioned is transferred from the inhibitors to the carrier to the lower portion and then to the wellhead. Using a lower portion with a carrier for the inhibitors may be advantageous when the distance between tubulars is small.

Power supplies are used to provide power to downhole power devices downhole loads such as but not limited to reservoir heaters electric submersible pumps ESPs compressors electric drills electrical tools for construction and maintenance diagnostic systems sensors or acoustic wave generators. Surface based power supplies may have long supply cabling power cables that contribute to problems such as voltage drops and electrical losses. Thus it may be necessary to provide power to the downhole loads at high voltages to reduce electrical losses. However many downhole loads are limited by an acceptable supply voltage level to the load. Therefore an efficient high voltage energy supply may not be viable without further conditioning. In such cases a system for stepping down the voltage from the high voltage supply cable to the low voltage load may be necessary. The system may be a transformer.

The electrical power supply for downhole loads is typically provided using alternating voltage AC voltage from supply grids of 50 Hz or 60 Hz frequency. The voltage of the supply grid may correspond to the voltage of the downhole load. High supply voltages may reduce loss and voltage drop in the supply cable and or allow the use of supply cables with relatively small cross sections. High supply voltages however may cause technical difficulties and require cost intensive isolation efforts at the load. Voltage drops electrical losses and supply cable cross section limits may limit the length of the supply cable and thus the wellbore depth or depth of the downhole load. Locating the transformer downhole may reduce the amount of cabling needed to provide power to the downhole loads and allow deeper wellbore depths and or downhole load depths while minimizing voltage drops and electrical losses in the power system.

Current technical solutions for offshore applications make use of sea bed mounted step down transformers to reduce cable loss for example Converter Fed Subsea Motor Drives Raad R. O. Henriksen T. Raphael H. B. Hadler Jacobsen A. Industry Applications IEEE Transactions on Volume 32 Issue 5 September October 1996 Page s 1069 1079 which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein . However these sea bed mounted transformers may not be useful to drive downhole loads under solid ground for example in a subsurface wellbore .

Core may include two half shell core sections A and B around primary windings A and secondary windings B. In certain embodiments core sections A and B are semicircular symmetric shells. Core sections A and B may be single pieces that extend the full length of transformer or the core sections may be assembled from multiple shell segments put together for example multiple pieces strung together to make the core sections . In certain embodiments a core section is formed by putting together the section from two halves. The two halves of the core section may be put together after the windings which may be pre fabricated are placed in the transformer.

In certain embodiments core sections A and B have about the same cross section on the circumference of transformer so that the core properly guides the magnetic flux in the transformer. Core sections A and B may be made of several layers of core material. Certain orientations of these layers may be designed to minimize eddy current losses in transformer . In some embodiments core sections A and B are made of continuous ribbons and windings A and B are wound into the core sections.

Transformer may have certain advantages over current transformer configurations such as a toroid core design with the winding on the outside of the cores . Core sections A and B have outer surfaces that offer large surface areas for cooling transformer . Additionally transformer may be sealed so that a cooling liquid may be continuously run across the outer surfaces of the transformer to cool the transformer. Transformer may be sealed so that cooling liquids do not directly contact the inside of the core and or the windings. In certain embodiments transformer is sealed in an epoxy resin or other electrically insulating sealing material. Cooling transformer allows the transformer to operate at higher power densities. In certain embodiments windings A and B are substantially isolated from core sections A and B so that the outside surfaces of transformer may touch the walls of a wellbore without causing electrical problems in the wellbore.

In some embodiments the profile of the core of transformer and or the winding window profile are made with clearances to allow for additional cooling devices mechanical supports and or electrical contacts on the transformer. In some embodiments transformer is coupled to one or more additional transformers in the subsurface wellbore to increase power in the wellbore and or phase options in the wellbore. Transformer and or the phases of the transformer may be coupled to the additional transformers and or the varying phases of the additional transformers in either series or parallel configurations as needed to provide power to the downhole load.

Power lead may be coupled to transformer and pass through packing material to provide power to the downhole load for example a downhole heater . In certain embodiments cooling fluid is located in wellbore . Transformer may be immersed in cooling fluid . Cooling fluid may cool transformer by removing heat from the transformer and moving the heat away from the transformer. Cooling fluid may be circulated in wellbore to increase heat transfer between transformer and the cooling fluid. In some embodiments cooling fluid is circulated to a chiller or other heat exchanger to remove heat from the cooling fluid and maintain a temperature of the cooling fluid at a selected temperature. Maintaining cooling fluid at a selected temperature may provide efficient heat transfer between the cooling fluid and transformer so that the transformer is maintained at a desired operating temperature.

In certain embodiments cooling fluid maintains a temperature of transformer below a selected temperature. The selected temperature may be a maximum operating temperature of the transformer. In some embodiments the selected temperature is a maximum temperature that allows for a selected operational efficiency of the transformer. In some embodiments transformer operates at an efficiency of at least 95 at least 90 at least 80 or at least 70 when the transformer operates below the selected temperature.

In certain embodiments cooling fluid is water. In some embodiments cooling fluid is another heat transfer fluid such as but not limited to oil ammonia helium or Freon E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company Wilmington Del. U.S.A. . In some embodiments the wellbore adjacent to the overburden functions as a heat pipe. Transformer boils cooling fluid . Vaporized cooling fluid rises in the wellbore condenses and flows back to transformer . Vaporization of cooling fluid transfers heat to the cooling fluid and condensation of the cooling fluid allows heat to transfer to the overburden. Transformer may operate near the vaporization temperature of cooling fluid .

In some embodiments cooling fluid is circulated in a pipe that surrounds the transformer. The pipe may be in direct thermal contact with the transformer so that heat is removed from the transformer into the cooling fluid circulating through the pipe. In some embodiments the transformer includes fans heat sinks fins or other devices that assist in transferring heat away from the transformer. In some embodiments the transformer is or includes a solid state transformer device such as an AC to DC converter.

In certain embodiments the cooling fluid for the downhole transformer is circulated using a heat pipe in the wellbore. depicts an embodiment of transformer in wellbore with heat pipes A B. Lid is placed at the top of a reservoir of cooling fluid that surrounds transformer . Heated cooling fluid expands and flows up heat pipe A. The heated cooling fluid cools adjacent to the overburden and flows back to lid . The cooled cooling fluid flows back into the reservoir through heat pipe B. Heat pipes A B act to create a flow path for the cooling fluid so that the cooling fluid circulates around transformer and maintains a temperature of the transformer below the selected temperature.

Computational analysis has shown that a circulated water column was sufficient to cool a 60 Hz transformer that was 125 feet in length and generated 80 W ft of heat. The transformer and the formation were initially at ambient temperatures. The water column was initially at an elevated temperature. The water column and transformer cooled over a period of about 1 to 2 hours. The transformer initially heated up but was still at operable temperatures but then was cooled by the water column to lower operable temperatures. The computations also showed that the transformer would be cooled by the water column when the transformer and the formation were initially at higher than normal temperatures.

Modern utility voltage regulators have microprocessor controllers that monitor output voltage and adjust taps up or down to match a desired setting. Typical controllers include current monitoring and may be equipped with remote communications capabilities. The controller firmware may be modified for current based control for example control desired for maintaining constant wattage as heater resistances vary with temperature . Load resistance monitoring as well as other electrical analysis based evaluation are a possibility because of the availability of both current and voltage sensing by the controller. Typical tap changers have a 200 of nominal short time current rating. Thus the regulator controller may be programmed to respond to overload currents by means of tap changer operation.

Electronic heater controls such as silicon controlled rectifiers SCRs may be used to provide power to and control subsurface heaters. SCRs may be expensive to use and may waste electrical energy in the power circuit. SCRs may also produce harmonic distortions during power control of the subsurface heaters. Harmonic distortion may put noise on the power line and stress heaters. In addition SCRs may overly stress heaters by switching the power between being full on and full off rather than regulating the power at or near the ideal current setting. Thus there may be significant overshooting and or undershooting at the target current for temperature limited heaters for example heaters using ferromagnetic materials for self limiting temperature control .

A variable voltage load tap changing transformer which is based on a load tap changing regulator design may be used to provide power to and control subsurface heaters more simply and without the harmonic distortion associated with electronic heater control. The variable voltage transformer may be connected to power distribution systems by simple inexpensive fused cutouts. The variable voltage transformer may provide a cost effective stand alone full function heater controller and isolation transformer.

Tap changer contacts either one tap or bridges between two taps to provide a midpoint between the two tap voltages. Thus 16 equivalent voltage steps are created for tap changer to couple to in tap changer section . The voltage steps divide the 10 range of regulation equally per step . Switch changes the voltage adjustment between plus and minus adjustment. Thus voltage can be regulated plus 10 or minus 10 from the input voltage.

Voltage transformer senses the potential at bushing . The potential at bushing may be used for evaluation by a microprocessor controller. The controller adjusts the tap position to match a preset value. Control power transformer provides power to operate the controller and the tap changer motor. Current transformer is used to sense current in the regulator.

The secondary winding in tap changer section steps down the first voltage across primary winding to a second voltage for example voltage lower than the first voltage or a second voltage . In certain embodiments the secondary winding in tap changer section steps down the voltage from primary winding to the second voltage that is between 5 and 20 of the first voltage across the primary winding. In some embodiments the secondary winding in tap changer section steps down the voltage from primary winding to the second voltage that is between 1 and 30 or between 3 and 25 of the first voltage across the primary winding. In one embodiment the secondary winding in tap changer section steps down the voltage from primary winding to the second voltage that is 10 of the first voltage across the primary winding. For example a first voltage of 7200 V across the primary winding may be stepped down to a second voltage of 720 V across the secondary winding in tap changer section .

In some embodiments the step down percentage in tap changer section is preset. In some embodiments the step down percentage in tap changer section may be adjusted as needed for desired operation of a load coupled to transformer .

Taps A H or any other number of taps divide the second voltage on the secondary winding in tap changer section into voltage steps. The second voltage is divided into voltage steps from a selected minimum percentage of the second voltage up to the full value of the second voltage. In certain embodiments the second voltage is divided into equivalent voltage steps between the selected minimum percentage and the full second voltage value. In some embodiments the selected minimum percentage is 0 of the second voltage. For example the second voltage may be equally divided by the taps in voltage steps ranging between 0 V and 720 V. In some embodiments the selected minimum percentage is 25 or 50 of the second voltage.

Transformer includes tap changer that contacts either one tap or bridges between two taps to provide a midpoint between the two tap voltages. The position of tap changer on the taps determines the voltage provided to an electrical load coupled to bushings . As an example an arrangement with 8 taps in tap changer section provides 16 voltage steps for tap changer to couple to in tap changer section . Thus the electrical load may be provided with 16 different voltages varying between the selected minimum percentage and the second voltage.

In certain embodiments of transformer the voltage steps divide the range between the selected minimum percentage and the second voltage equally the voltage steps are equivalent . For example eight taps may divide a second voltage of 720 V into 16 voltage steps between 0 V and 720 V so that each tap increments the voltage provided to the electrical load by 45V. In some embodiments the voltage steps divide the range between the selected minimum percentage and the second voltage in non equal increments the voltage steps are not equivalent .

Switch may be used to electrically disconnect bushing from the secondary winding and taps . Electrically isolating bushing from the secondary winding turns off the power voltage provided to the electrical load coupled to bushings . Thus switch provides an internal disconnect in transformer to electrically isolate and turn off power voltage to the electrical load coupled to the transformer.

In transformer voltage transformer control power transformer and current transformer are electrically isolated from primary winding . Electrical isolation protects voltage transformer control power transformer and current transformer from current and or voltage overloads caused by primary winding .

In certain embodiments transformer is used to provide power to a variable electrical load for example a subsurface heater such as but not limited to a temperature limited heater using ferromagnetic material that self limits at the Curie temperature or a phase transition temperature range . Transformer allows power to the electrical load to be adjusted in small voltage increments voltage steps by moving tap changer between taps . Thus the voltage supplied to the electrical load may be adjusted incrementally to provide constant current to the electrical load in response to changes in the electrical load for example changes in resistance of the electrical load . Voltage to the electrical load may be controlled from a minimum voltage the selected minimum percentage up to full potential the second voltage in increments. The increments may be equal increments or non equal increments. Thus power to the electrical load does not have to be turned full on or off to control the electrical load such as is done with a SCR controller. Using small increments may reduce cycling stress on the electrical load and may increase the lifetime of the device that is the electrical load. Transformer changes the voltage using mechanical operation instead of the electrical switching used in SCRs. Electrical switching can add harmonics and or noise to the voltage signal provided to the electrical load. The mechanical switching of transformer provides clean noise free incrementally adjustable control of the voltage provided to the electrical load.

Transformer may be controlled by controller . Controller may be a microprocessor controller. Controller may be powered by control power transformer . Controller may assess properties of transformer including tap changer section and or the electrical load coupled to the transformer. Examples of properties that may be assessed by controller include but are not limited to voltage current power power factor harmonics tap change operation count maximum and minimum value recordings wear of the tap changer contacts and electrical load resistance.

In certain embodiments controller is coupled to the electrical load to assess properties of the electrical load. For example controller may be coupled to the electrical load using an optical fiber. The optical fiber allows measurement of properties of the electrical load such as but not limited to electrical resistance impedance capacitance and or temperature. In some embodiments controller is coupled to voltage transformer and or current transformer to assess the voltage and or current output of transformer . In some embodiments the voltage and current are used to assess a resistance of the electrical load over one or more selected period of times. In some embodiments the voltage and current are used to assess or diagnose other properties of the electrical load for example temperature .

In certain embodiments controller adjusts the voltage output of transformer in response to changes in the electrical load coupled to the transformer or other changes in the power distribution system such as but not limited to input voltage to the primary winding or other power supply changes. For example controller may adjust the voltage output of transformer in response to changes in the electrical resistance of the electrical load. Controller may adjust the output voltage by controlling the movement of control tap changer between taps to adjust the voltage output of transformer . In some embodiments controller adjusts the voltage output of transformer so that the electrical load for example a subsurface heater is operated at a relatively constant current. In some embodiments controller may adjust the voltage output of transformer by moving tap changer to a new tap assess the resistance and or power at the new tap and move the tap changer to another new tap if needed.

In some embodiments controller assesses the electrical resistance of the load for example by measuring the voltage and current using the voltage and current transformers or by measuring the resistance of the electrical load using the optical fiber and compares the assessed electrical resistance to a theoretical resistance. Controller may adjust the voltage output of transformer in response to differences between the assessed resistance and the theoretical resistance. In some embodiments the theoretical resistance is an ideal resistance for operation of the electrical load. In some embodiments the theoretical resistance varies over time due to other changes in the electrical load for example temperature of the electrical load .

In some embodiments controller is programmable to cycle tap changer between two or more taps to achieve intermediate voltage outputs for example a voltage output between two tap voltage outputs . Controller may adjust the time tap changer is on each of the taps cycled between to obtain an average voltage at or near the desired intermediate voltage output. For example controller may keep tap changer at two taps approximately 50 of the time each to maintain an average voltage approximately midway between the voltages at the two taps.

In some embodiments controller is programmable to limit the numbers of voltage changes movement of tap changer between taps or cycles of tap changes over a period of time. For example controller may only allow 1 tap change every 30 minutes or 2 tap changes per hour. Limiting the number of tap changes over the period of time reduces the stress on the electrical load for example a heater from changes in voltage to the load. Reducing the stresses applied to the electrical load may increase the lifetime of the electrical load. Limiting the number of tap changes may also increase the lifetime of the tap changer apparatus. In some embodiments the number of tap changes over the period of time is adjustable using the controller. For example a user may be allowed to adjust the cycle limit for tap changes on transformer .

In some embodiments controller is programmable to power the electrical load in a start up sequence. For example subsurface heaters may require a certain start up protocol such as high current during early times of heating and lower current as the temperature of the heater reaches a set point . Ramping up power to the heaters in a desired procedure may reduce mechanical stresses on the heaters from materials expanding at different rates. In some embodiments controller ramps up power to the electrical load with controlled increases in voltage steps over time. In some embodiments controller ramps up power to the electrical load with controlled increases in watts per hour. Controller may be programmed to automatically start up the electrical load according to a user input start up procedure or a pre programmed start up procedure.

In some embodiments controller is programmable to turn off power to the electrical load in a shut down sequence. For example subsurface heaters may require a certain shut down protocol to inhibit the heaters from cooling to quickly. Controller may be programmed to automatically shut down the electrical load according to a user input shut down procedure or a pre programmed shut down procedure.

In some embodiments controller is programmable to power the electrical load in a moisture removal sequence. For example subsurface heaters or motors may require start up at second voltages to remove moisture from the system before application of higher voltages. In some embodiments controller inhibits increases in voltage until required electrical load resistance values are met. Limiting increases in voltage may inhibit transformer from applying voltages that cause shorting due to moisture in the system. Controller may be programmed to automatically start up the electrical load according to a user input moisture removal sequence or a pre programmed moisture removal procedure.

In some embodiments controller is programmable to reduce power to the electrical load based on changes in the voltage input to primary winding . For example the power to the electrical load may be reduced during brownouts or other power supply shortages. Reducing the power to the electrical load may compensate for the reduced power supply.

In some embodiments controller is programmable to protect the electrical load from being overloaded. Controller may be programmed to automatically and immediately reduce the voltage output if the current to the electrical load increases above a selected value. The voltage output may be stepped down as fast as possible while sensing the current. Sensing of the current occurs on a faster time scale than the step downs in voltage so the voltage may be stepped down as fast as possible until the current drops below a selected level. In some embodiments tap changes voltage steps may be inhibited above higher current levels. At the higher current levels secondary fusing may be used to limit the current. Reducing the tap setting in response to the higher current levels may allow for continued operation of the transformer even after partial failure or quenching of electrical loads such as heaters.

In some embodiments controller records or tracks data from the operation of the electrical load and or transformer . For example controller may record changes in the resistance or other properties of the electrical load or transformer . In some embodiments controller records faults in operation of transformer for example missed step changes .

In certain embodiments controller includes communication modules. The communication modules may be programmed to provide status data and or diagnostics for any device or system coupled to the controller such as the electrical load or transformer . The communication modules may communicate using RS485 serial communication Ethernet fiber wireless and or other communication technologies known in the art. The communication modules may be used to transmit information remotely to another site so that controller and transformer are operated in a self contained or automatic manner but are able to report to another location for example a central monitoring location . The central monitoring location may monitor several controllers and transformers for example controllers and transformers located in a hydrocarbon processing field . In some embodiments users or equipment at the central monitoring location are able to remotely operate one or more of the controllers using the communications modules.

In certain embodiments is mounted on a pole or otherwise supported off the ground. In some embodiments one or more enclosures are mounted on an elevated platform supported by a pole or elevated mounting support. Mounting on a pole or mounting support increases air circulation around and in the enclosure and transformer . Increasing air circulation decreases operating temperatures and increases efficiency of the transformer. In certain embodiments components of transformer are coupled to the top of so that the components are removed as a single unit from the enclosure by removing the top of the enclosure.

In certain embodiments three transformers are used to operate three or multiples of three electrical loads in a three phase configuration. The three transformers may be monitored to assess if the tap positions in each transformer are in sync at the same tap position . In some embodiments one controller is used to control the three transformers. The controller may monitor the transformers to ensure that the transformers are in sync.

In certain embodiments a temperature limited heater is utilized for heavy oil applications for example treatment of relatively permeable formations or tar sands formations . A temperature limited heater may provide a relatively low Curie temperature and or phase transformation temperature range so that a maximum average operating temperature of the heater is less than 350 C. 300 C. 250 C. 225 C. 200 C. or 150 C. In an embodiment for example for a tar sands formation a maximum temperature of the temperature limited heater is less than about 250 C. to inhibit olefin generation and production of other cracked products. In some embodiments a maximum temperature of the temperature limited heater is above about 250 C. to produce lighter hydrocarbon products. In some embodiments the maximum temperature of the heater may be at or less than about 500 C.

A heater may heat a volume of formation adjacent to a production wellbore a near production wellbore region so that the temperature of fluid in the production wellbore and in the volume adjacent to the production wellbore is less than the temperature that causes degradation of the fluid. The heat source may be located in the production wellbore or near the production wellbore. In some embodiments the heat source is a temperature limited heater. In some embodiments two or more heat sources may supply heat to the volume. Heat from the heat source may reduce the viscosity of crude oil in or near the production wellbore. In some embodiments heat from the heat source mobilizes fluids in or near the production wellbore and or enhances the flow of fluids to the production wellbore. In some embodiments reducing the viscosity of crude oil allows or enhances gas lifting of heavy oil at most about 10 API gravity oil or intermediate gravity oil approximately 12 to 20 API gravity oil from the production wellbore. In certain embodiments the initial API gravity of oil in the formation is at most 10 at most 20 at most 25 or at most 30 . In certain embodiments the viscosity of oil in the formation is at least 0.05 Pa s 50 cp . In some embodiments the viscosity of oil in the formation is at least 0.10 Pa s 100 cp at least 0.15 Pa s 150 cp or at least at least 0.20 Pa s 200 cp . Large amounts of natural gas may have to be utilized to provide gas lift of oil with viscosities above 0.05 Pa s. Reducing the viscosity of oil at or near the production wellbore in the formation to a viscosity of 0.05 Pa s 50 cp 0.03 Pa s 30 cp 0.02 Pa s 20 cp 0.01 Pa s 10 cp or less down to 0.001 Pa s 1 cp or lower lowers the amount of natural gas or other fluid needed to lift oil from the formation. In some embodiments reduced viscosity oil is produced by other methods such as pumping.

The rate of production of oil from the formation may be increased by raising the temperature at or near a production wellbore to reduce the viscosity of the oil in the formation in and adjacent to the production wellbore. In certain embodiments the rate of production of oil from the formation is increased by 2 times 3 times 4 times or greater or up to 20 times over standard cold production which has no external heating of formation during production. Certain formations may be more economically viable for enhanced oil production using the heating of the near production wellbore region. Formations that have a cold production rate approximately between 0.05 m day per meter of wellbore length and 0.20 m day per meter of wellbore length may have significant improvements in production rate using heating to reduce the viscosity in the near production wellbore region. In some formations production wells up to 775 m up to 1000 m or up to 1500 m in length are used. Thus a significant increase in production is achievable in some formations. Heating the near production wellbore region may be used in formations where the cold production rate is not between 0.05 m day per meter of wellbore length and 0.20 m day per meter of wellbore length but heating such formations may not be as economically favorable. Higher cold production rates may not be significantly increased by heating the near wellbore region while lower production rates may not be increased to an economically useful value.

Using the temperature limited heater to reduce the viscosity of oil at or near the production well inhibits problems associated with non temperature limited heaters and heating the oil in the formation due to hot spots. One possible problem is that non temperature limited heaters can cause coking of oil at or near the production well if the heater overheats the oil because the heaters are at too high a temperature. Higher temperatures in the production well may also cause brine to boil in the well which may lead to scale formation in the well. Non temperature limited heaters that reach higher temperatures may also cause damage to other wellbore components for example screens used for sand control pumps or valves . Hot spots may be caused by portions of the formation expanding against or collapsing on the heater. In some embodiments the heater either the temperature limited heater or another type of non temperature limited heater has sections that are lower because of sagging over long heater distances. These lower sections may sit in heavy oil or bitumen that collects in lower portions of the wellbore. At these lower sections the heater may develop hot spots due to coking of the heavy oil or bitumen. A standard non temperature limited heater may overheat at these hot spots thus producing a non uniform amount of heat along the length of the heater. Using the temperature limited heater may inhibit overheating of the heater at hot spots or lower sections and provide more uniform heating along the length of the wellbore.

In certain embodiments fluids in the relatively permeable formation containing heavy hydrocarbons are produced with little or no pyrolyzation of hydrocarbons in the formation. In certain embodiments the relatively permeable formation containing heavy hydrocarbons is a tar sands formation. For example the formation may be a tar sands formation such as the Athabasca tar sands formation in Alberta Canada or a carbonate formation such as the Grosmont carbonate formation in Alberta Canada. The fluids produced from the formation are mobilized fluids. Producing mobilized fluids may be more economical than producing pyrolyzed fluids from the tar sands formation. Producing mobilized fluids may also increase the total amount of hydrocarbons produced from the tar sands formation.

In heaters are placed in an alternating triangular pattern in hydrocarbon layer . In and heaters are placed in an alternating triangular pattern in hydrocarbon layer that repeats vertically to encompass a majority or all of the hydrocarbon layer. In the alternating triangular pattern of heaters in hydrocarbon layer repeats uninterrupted across shale break . In heaters may be equidistantly spaced from each other. In the embodiments depicted in the number of vertical rows of heaters depends on factors such as but not limited to the desired spacing between the heaters the thickness of hydrocarbon layer and or the number and location of shale breaks . In some embodiments heaters are arranged in other patterns. For example heaters may be arranged in patterns such as but not limited to hexagonal patterns square patterns or rectangular patterns.

In the embodiments depicted in heaters provide heat that mobilizes hydrocarbons reduces the viscosity of the hydrocarbons in hydrocarbon layer . In certain embodiments heaters provide heat that reduces the viscosity of the hydrocarbons in hydrocarbon layer below about 0.50 Pa s 500 cp below about 0.10 Pa s 100 cp or below about 0.05 Pa s 50 cp . The spacing between heaters and or the heat output of the heaters may be designed and or controlled to reduce the viscosity of the hydrocarbons in hydrocarbon layer to desirable values. Heat provided by heaters may be controlled so that little or no pyrolyzation occurs in hydrocarbon layer . Superposition of heat between the heaters may create one or more drainage paths for example paths for flow of fluids between the heaters. In certain embodiments production wells A and or production wells B are located proximate heaters so that heat from the heaters superimposes over the production wells. The superimposition of heat from heaters over production wells A and or production wells B creates one or more drainage paths from the heaters to the production wells. In certain embodiments one or more of the drainage paths converge. For example the drainage paths may converge at or near a bottommost heater and or the drainage paths may converge at or near production wells A and or production wells B. Fluids mobilized in hydrocarbon layer tend to flow towards the bottommost heaters production wells A and or production wells B in the hydrocarbon layer because of gravity and the heat and pressure gradients established by the heaters and or the production wells. The drainage paths and or the converged drainage paths allow production wells A and or production wells B to collect mobilized fluids in hydrocarbon layer .

In certain embodiments hydrocarbon layer has sufficient permeability to allow mobilized fluids to drain to production wells A and or production wells B. For example hydrocarbon layer may have a permeability of at least about 0.1 darcy at least about 1 darcy at least about 10 darcy or at least about 100 darcy. In some embodiments hydrocarbon layer has a relatively large vertical permeability to horizontal permeability ratio K K . For example hydrocarbon layer may have a K Kratio between about 0.01 and about 2 between about 0.1 and about 1 or between about 0.3 and about 0.7.

In certain embodiments fluids are produced through production wells A located near heaters in the lower portion of hydrocarbon layer . In some embodiments fluids are produced through production wells B located below and approximately midway between heaters in the lower portion of hydrocarbon layer . At least a portion of production wells A and or production wells B may be oriented substantially horizontal in hydrocarbon layer as shown in the production wells have horizontal portions that go into and out of the page . Production wells A and or B may be located proximate lower portion heaters or the bottommost heaters.

In some embodiments production wells A are positioned substantially vertically below the bottommost heaters in hydrocarbon layer . Production wells A may be located below heaters at the bottom vertex of a pattern of the heaters for example at the bottom vertex of the triangular pattern of heaters depicted in . Locating production wells A substantially vertically below the bottommost heaters may allow for efficient collection of mobilized fluids from hydrocarbon layer .

In certain embodiments the bottommost heaters are located between about 2 m and about 10 m from the bottom of hydrocarbon layer between about 4 m and about 8 m from the bottom of the hydrocarbon layer or between about 5 m and about 7 m from the bottom of the hydrocarbon layer. In certain embodiments production wells A and or production wells B are located at a distance from the bottommost heaters that allows heat from the heaters to superimpose over the production wells but at a distance from the heaters that inhibits coking at the production wells. Production wells A and or production wells B may be located a distance from the nearest heater for example the bottommost heater of at most of the spacing between heaters in the pattern of heaters for example the triangular pattern of heaters depicted in . In some embodiments production wells A and or production wells B are located a distance from the nearest heater of at most at most or at most of the spacing between heaters in the pattern of heaters. In certain embodiments production wells A and or production wells B are located between about 2 m and about 10 m from the bottommost heaters between about 4 m and about 8 m from the bottommost heaters or between about 5 m and about 7 m from the bottommost heaters. Production wells A and or production wells B may be located between about 0.5 m and about 8 m from the bottom of hydrocarbon layer between about 1 m and about 5 m from the bottom of the hydrocarbon layer or between about 2 m and about 4 m from the bottom of the hydrocarbon layer.

In some embodiments at least some production wells A are located substantially vertically below heaters near shale break as depicted in . Production wells A may be located between heaters and shale break to produce fluids that flow and collect above the shale break. Shale break may be an impermeable barrier in hydrocarbon layer . In some embodiments shale break has a thickness between about 1 m and about 6 m between about 2 m and about 5 m or between about 3 m and about 4 m. Production wells A between heaters and shale break may produce fluids from the upper portion of hydrocarbon layer above the shale break and production wells A below the bottommost heaters in the hydrocarbon layer may produce fluids from the lower portion of the hydrocarbon layer below the shale break as depicted in . In some embodiments two or more shale breaks may exist in a hydrocarbon layer. In such an embodiment production wells are placed at or near each of the shale breaks to produce fluids flowing and collecting above the shale breaks.

In some embodiments shale break breaks down is desiccated or decomposes as the shale break is heated by heaters on either side of the shale break. As shale break breaks down the permeability of the shale break increases and fluids flow through the shale break. Once fluids are able to flow through shale break production wells above the shale break may not be needed for production as fluids can flow to production wells at or near the bottom of hydrocarbon layer and be produced there.

In certain embodiments the bottommost heaters above shale break are located between about 2 m and about 10 m from the shale break between about 4 m and about 8 m from the bottom of the shale break or between about 5 m and about 7 m from the shale break. Production wells A may be located between about 2 m and about 10 m from the bottommost heaters above shale break between about 4 m and about 8 m from the bottommost heaters above the shale break or between about 5 m and about 7 m from the bottommost heaters above the shale break. Production wells A may be located between about 0.5 m and about 8 m from shale break between about 1 m and about 5 m from the shale break or between about 2 m and about 4 m from the shale break.

In some embodiments heat is provided in production wells A and or production wells B depicted in . Providing heat in production wells A and or production wells B may maintain and or enhance the mobility of the fluids in the production wells. Heat provided in production wells A and or production wells B may superimpose with heat from heaters to create the flow path from the heaters to the production wells. In some embodiments production wells A and or production wells B include a pump to move fluids to the surface of the formation. In some embodiments the viscosity of fluids oil in production wells A and or production wells B is lowered using heaters and or diluent injection for example using a conduit in the production wells for injecting the diluent .

In certain embodiments in situ heat treatment of the relatively permeable formation containing hydrocarbons for example the tar sands formation includes heating the formation to visbreaking temperatures. For example the formation may be heated to temperatures between about 100 C. and 260 C. between about 150 C. and about 250 C. between about 200 C. and about 240 C. between about 205 C. and 230 C. between about 210 C. and 225 C. In one embodiment the formation is heated to a temperature of about 220 C. In one embodiment the formation is heated to a temperature of about 230 C. At visbreaking temperatures fluids in the formation have a reduced viscosity versus their initial viscosity at initial formation temperature that allows fluids to flow in the formation. The reduced viscosity at visbreaking temperatures may be a permanent reduction in viscosity as the hydrocarbons go through a step change in viscosity at visbreaking temperatures versus heating to mobilization temperatures which may only temporarily reduce the viscosity . The visbroken fluids may have API gravities that are relatively low for example at most about 10 about 12 about 15 or about 19 API gravity but the API gravities are higher than the API gravity of non visbroken fluid from the formation. The non visbroken fluid from the formation may have an API gravity of 7 or less.

In some embodiments heaters in the formation are operated at full power output to heat the formation to visbreaking temperatures or higher temperatures. Operating at full power may rapidly increase the pressure in the formation. In certain embodiments fluids are produced from the formation to maintain a pressure in the formation below a selected pressure as the temperature of the formation increases. In some embodiments the selected pressure is a fracture pressure of the formation. In certain embodiments the selected pressure is between about 1000 kPa and about 15000 kPa between about 2000 kPa and about 10000 kPa or between about 2500 kPa and about 5000 kPa. In one embodiment the selected pressure is about 10000 kPa. Maintaining the pressure as close to the fracture pressure as possible may minimize the number of production wells needed for producing fluids from the formation.

In certain embodiments treating the formation includes maintaining the temperature at or near visbreaking temperatures as described above during the entire production phase while maintaining the pressure below the fracture pressure. The heat provided to the formation may be reduced or eliminated to maintain the temperature at or near visbreaking temperatures. Heating to visbreaking temperatures but maintaining the temperature below pyrolysis temperatures or near pyrolysis temperatures for example below about 230 C. inhibits coke formation and or higher level reactions. Heating to visbreaking temperatures at higher pressures for example pressures near but below the fracture pressure keeps produced gases in the liquid oil hydrocarbons in the formation and increases hydrogen reduction in the formation with higher hydrogen partial pressures. Heating the formation to only visbreaking temperatures also uses less energy input than heating the formation to pyrolysis temperatures.

Fluids produced from the formation may include visbroken fluids mobilized fluids and or pyrolyzed fluids. In some embodiments a produced mixture that includes these fluids is produced from the formation. The produced mixture may have assessable properties for example measurable properties . The produced mixture properties are determined by operating conditions in the formation being treated for example temperature and or pressure in the formation . In certain embodiments the operating conditions may be selected varied and or maintained to produce desirable properties in hydrocarbons in the produced mixture. For example the produced mixture may include hydrocarbons that have properties that allow the mixture to be easily transported for example sent through a pipeline without adding diluent or blending the mixture and or resulting hydrocarbons with another fluid .

In some embodiments after the formation reaches visbreaking temperatures the pressure in the formation is reduced. In certain embodiments the pressure in the formation is reduced at temperatures above visbreaking temperatures. Reducing the pressure at higher temperatures allows more of the hydrocarbons in the formation to be converted to higher quality hydrocarbons by visbreaking and or pyrolysis. Allowing the formation to reach higher temperatures before pressure reduction however may increase the amount of carbon dioxide produced and or the amount of coking in the formation. For example in some formations coking of bitumen at pressures above 700 kPa begins at about 280 C. and reaches a maximum rate at about 340 C. At pressures below about 700 kPa the coking rate in the formation is minimal. Allowing the formation to reach higher temperatures before pressure reduction may decrease the amount of hydrocarbons produced from the formation.

In certain embodiments the temperature in the formation for example an average temperature of the formation when the pressure in the formation is reduced is selected to balance one or more factors. The factors considered may include the quality of hydrocarbons produced the amount of hydrocarbons produced the amount of carbon dioxide produced the amount hydrogen sulfide produced the degree of coking in the formation and or the amount of water produced. Experimental assessments using formation samples and or simulated assessments based on the formation properties may be used to assess results of treating the formation using the in situ heat treatment process. These results may be used to determine a selected temperature or temperature range for when the pressure in the formation is to be reduced. The selected temperature or temperature range may also be affected by factors such as but not limited to hydrocarbon or oil market conditions and other economic factors. In certain embodiments the selected temperature is in a range between about 275 C. and about 305 C. between about 280 C. and about 300 C. or between about 285 C. and about 295 C.

In certain embodiments an average temperature in the formation is assessed from an analysis of fluids produced from the formation. For example the average temperature of the formation may be assessed from an analysis of the fluids that have been produced to maintain the pressure in the formation below the fracture pressure of the formation.

In some embodiments values of the hydrocarbon isomer shift in fluids for example gases produced from the formation is used to indicate the average temperature in the formation. Experimental analysis and or simulation may be used to assess one or more hydrocarbon isomer shifts and relate the values of the hydrocarbon isomer shifts to the average temperature in the formation. The assessed relation between the hydrocarbon isomer shifts and the average temperature may then be used in the field to assess the average temperature in the formation by monitoring one or more of the hydrocarbon isomer shifts in fluids produced from the formation. In some embodiments the pressure in the formation is reduced when the monitored hydrocarbon isomer shift reaches a selected value. The selected value of the hydrocarbon isomer shift may be chosen based on the selected temperature or temperature range in the formation for reducing the pressure in the formation and the assessed relation between the hydrocarbon isomer shift and the average temperature. Examples of hydrocarbon isomer shifts that may be assessed include but are not limited to n butane Cpercentage versus propane Cpercentage n pentane Cpercentage versus propane Cpercentage n pentane Cpercentage versus n butane Cpercentage and i pentane Cpercentage versus i butane Cpercentage. In some embodiments the hydrocarbon isomer shift in produced fluids is used to indicate the amount of conversion for example amount of pyrolysis that has taken place in the formation.

In some embodiments weight percentages of saturates in fluids produced from the formation is used to indicate the average temperature in the formation. Experimental analysis and or simulation may be used to assess the weight percentage of saturates as a function of the average temperature in the formation. For example SARA Saturates Aromatics Resins and Asphaltenes analysis sometimes referred to as Asphaltene Wax Hydrate Deposition analysis may be used to assess the weight percentage of saturates in a sample of fluids from the formation. In some formations the weight percentage of saturates has a linear relationship to the average temperature in the formation. The relation between the weight percentage of saturates and the average temperature may then be used in the field to assess the average temperature in the formation by monitoring the weight percentage of saturates in fluids produced from the formation. In some embodiments the pressure in the formation is reduced when the monitored weight percentage of saturates reaches a selected value. The selected value of the weight percentage of saturates may be chosen based on the selected temperature or temperature range in the formation for reducing the pressure in the formation and the relation between the weight percentage of saturates and the average temperature. In some embodiments the selected value of weight percentage of saturates is between about 20 and about 40 between about 25 and about 35 or between about 28 and about 32 . For example the selected value may be about 30 by weight saturates.

In some embodiments weight percentages of n Cin fluids produced from the formation is used to indicate the average temperature in the formation. Experimental analysis and or simulation may be used to assess the weight percentages of n Cas a function of the average temperature in the formation. In some formations the weight percentages of n Chas a linear relationship to the average temperature in the formation. The relation between the weight percentages of n Cand the average temperature may then be used in the field to assess the average temperature in the formation by monitoring the weight percentages of n Cin fluids produced from the formation. In some embodiments the pressure in the formation is reduced when the monitored weight percentage of n Creaches a selected value. The selected value of the weight percentage of n Cmay be chosen based on the selected temperature or temperature range in the formation for reducing the pressure in the formation and the relation between the weight percentage of n Cand the average temperature. In some embodiments the selected value of weight percentage of n Cis between about 50 and about 70 between about 55 and about 65 or between about 58 and about 62 . For example the selected value may be about 60 by weight n C.

The pressure in the formation may be reduced by producing fluids for example visbroken fluids and or mobilized fluids from the formation. In some embodiments the pressure is reduced below a pressure at which fluids coke in the formation to inhibit coking at pyrolysis temperatures. For example the pressure is reduced to a pressure below about 1000 kPa below about 800 kPa or below about 700 kPa for example about 690 kPa . In certain embodiments the selected pressure is at least about 100 kPa at least about 200 kPa or at least about 300 kPa. The pressure may be reduced to inhibit coking of asphaltenes or other high molecular weight hydrocarbons in the formation. In some embodiments the pressure may be maintained below a pressure at which water passes through a liquid phase at downhole formation temperatures to inhibit liquid water and dolomite reactions. After reducing the pressure in the formation the temperature may be increased to pyrolysis temperatures to begin pyrolyzation and or upgrading of fluids in the formation. The pyrolyzed and or upgraded fluids may be produced from the formation.

In certain embodiments the amount of fluids produced at temperatures below visbreaking temperatures the amount of fluids produced at visbreaking temperatures the amount of fluids produced before reducing the pressure in the formation and or the amount of upgraded or pyrolyzed fluids produced may be varied to control the quality and amount of fluids produced from the formation and the total recovery of hydrocarbons from the formation. For example producing more fluid during the early stages of treatment for example producing fluids before reducing the pressure in the formation may increase the total recovery of hydrocarbons from the formation while reducing the overall quality lowering the overall API gravity of fluid produced from the formation. The overall quality is reduced because more heavy hydrocarbons are produced by producing more fluids at the lower temperatures. Producing less fluids at the lower temperatures may increase the overall quality of the fluids produced from the formation but may lower the total recovery of hydrocarbons from the formation. The total recovery may be lower because more coking occurs in the formation when less fluids are produced at lower temperatures.

In certain embodiments the formation is heated using isolated cells of heaters cells or sections of the formation that are not interconnected for fluid flow . The isolated cells may be created by using larger heater spacings in the formation. For example large heater spacings may be used in the embodiments depicted in . These isolated cells may be produced during early stages of heating for example at temperatures below visbreaking temperatures . Because the cells are isolated from other cells in the formation the pressures in the isolated cells are high and more liquids are producible from the isolated cells. Thus more liquids may be produced from the formation and a higher total recovery of hydrocarbons may be reached. During later stages of heating the heat gradient may interconnect the isolated cells and pressures in the formation will drop.

In certain embodiments the heat gradient in the formation is modified so that a gas cap is created at or near an upper portion of the hydrocarbon layer. For example the heat gradient made by heaters depicted in the embodiments depicted in may be modified to create the gas cap at or near overburden of hydrocarbon layer . The gas cap may push or drive liquids to the bottom of the hydrocarbon layer so that more liquids may be produced from the formation. In situ generation of the gas cap may be more efficient than introducing pressurized fluid into the formation. The in situ generated gas cap applies force evenly through the formation with little or no channeling or fingering that may reduce the effectiveness of introduced pressurized fluid.

In certain embodiments the number and or location of production wells in the formation is varied based on the viscosity of fluid in the formation. The viscosities in the zones may be assessed before placing the production wells in the formation before heating the formation and or after heating the formation. In some embodiments more production wells are located in zones in the formation that have lower viscosities. For example in certain formations upper portions or zones of the formation may have lower viscosities. Thus in some embodiments more production wells are located in the upper zones. Producing through production wells in the less viscous zones of the formation may result in production of higher quality more upgraded oil from the formation.

In some embodiments more production wells are located in zones in the formation that have higher viscosities. Pressure propagation may be slower in the zones with higher viscosities. The slower pressure propagation may make it more difficult to control pressure in the zones with higher viscosities. Thus more production wells may be located in the zones with higher viscosities to provide better pressure control in these zones.

In some embodiments zones in the formation with different assessed viscosities are heated at different rates. In certain embodiments zones in the formation with higher viscosities are heated at higher heating rates than zones with lower viscosities. Heating the zones with higher viscosities at the higher heating rates mobilizes and or upgrades these zones at a faster rate so that these zones may catch up in viscosity and or quality to the slower heated zones.

In some embodiments the heater spacing is varied to provide different heating rates to zones in the formation with different assessed viscosities. For example denser heater spacings less spaces between heaters may be used in zones with higher viscosities to heat these zones at higher heating rates. In some embodiments a production well for example a substantially vertical production well is located in the zones with denser heater spacings and higher viscosities. The production well may be used to remove fluids from the formation and relieve pressure from the higher viscosity zones. In some embodiments one or more substantially vertical openings or production wells are located in the higher viscosity zones to allow fluids to drain in the higher viscosity zones. The draining fluids may be produced from the formation through production wells located near the bottom of the higher viscosity zones.

In certain embodiments production wells are located in more than one zone in the formation. The zones may have different initial permeabilities. In certain embodiments a first zone has an initial permeability of at least about 1 darcy and a second zone has an initial permeability of at most about 0.1 darcy. In some embodiments the first zone has an initial permeability of between about 1 darcy and about 10 darcy. In some embodiments the second zone has an initial permeability between about 0.01 darcy and 0.1 darcy. The zones may be separated by a substantially impermeable barrier with an initial permeability of about 10 darcy or less . Having the production well located in both zones allows for fluid communication permeability between the zones and or pressure equalization between the zones.

In some embodiments openings for example substantially vertical openings are formed between zones with different initial permeabilities that are separated by a substantially impermeable barrier. Bridging the zones with the openings allows for fluid communication permeability between the zones and or pressure equalization between the zones. In some embodiments openings in the formation such as pressure relief openings and or production wells allow gases or low viscosity fluids to rise in the openings. As the gases or low viscosity fluids rise the fluids may condense or increase viscosity in the openings so that the fluids drain back down the openings to be further upgraded in the formation. Thus the openings may act as heat pipes by transferring heat from the lower portions to the upper portions where the fluids condense. The wellbores may be packed and sealed near or at the overburden to inhibit transport of formation fluid to the surface.

In some embodiments production of fluids is continued after reducing and or turning off heating of the formation. The formation may be heated for a selected time. The formation may be heated until it reaches a selected average temperature. Production from the formation may continue after the selected time. Continuing production may produce more fluid from the formation as fluids drain towards the bottom of the formation and or as fluids are upgraded by passing by hot spots in the formation. In some embodiments a horizontal production well is located at or near the bottom of the formation or a zone of the formation to produce fluids after heating is turned down and or off.

In certain embodiments initially produced fluids for example fluids produced below visbreaking temperatures fluids produced at visbreaking temperatures and or other viscous fluids produced from the formation are blended with diluent to produce fluids with lower viscosities. In some embodiments the diluent includes upgraded or pyrolyzed fluids produced from the formation. In some embodiments the diluent includes upgraded or pyrolyzed fluids produced from another portion of the formation or another formation. In certain embodiments the amount of fluids produced at temperatures below visbreaking temperatures and or fluids produced at visbreaking temperatures that are blended with upgraded fluids from the formation is adjusted to create a fluid suitable for transportation and or use in a refinery. The amount of blending may be adjusted so that the fluid has chemical and physical stability. Maintaining the chemical and physical stability of the fluid may allow the fluid to be transported reduce pre treatment processes at a refinery and or reduce or eliminate the need for adjusting the refinery process to compensate for the fluid.

In certain embodiments formation conditions for example pressure and temperature and or fluid production are controlled to produce fluids with selected properties. For example formation conditions and or fluid production may be controlled to produce fluids with a selected API gravity and or a selected viscosity. The selected API gravity and or selected viscosity may be produced by combining fluids produced at different formation conditions for example combining fluids produced at different temperatures during the treatment as described above . As an example formation conditions and or fluid production may be controlled to produce fluids with an API gravity of about 190 and a viscosity of about 0.35 Pa s 350 cp at 5 C.

In certain embodiments a drive process for example a steam injection process such as cyclic steam injection a steam assisted gravity drainage process SAGD a solvent injection process a vapor solvent and SAGD process or a carbon dioxide injection process is used to treat the tar sands formation in addition to the in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments heaters are used to create high permeability zones or injection zones in the formation for the drive process. Heaters may be used to create a mobilization geometry or production network in the formation to allow fluids to flow through the formation during the drive process. For example heaters may be used to create drainage paths between the heaters and production wells for the drive process. In some embodiments the heaters are used to provide heat during the drive process. The amount of heat provided by the heaters may be small compared to the heat input from the drive process for example the heat input from steam injection .

The concentration of components in the formation and or produced fluids may change during an in situ heat treatment process. As the concentration of the components in the formation and or produced fluids and or hydrocarbons separated from the produced fluid changes due to formation of the components solubility of the components in the produced fluids and or separated hydrocarbons tends to change. Hydrocarbons separated from the produced fluid may be hydrocarbons that have been treated to remove salty water and or gases from the produced fluid to facilitate transportation the hydrocarbons. For example the produced fluids and or separated hydrocarbons may contain components that are soluble in the condensable hydrocarbon portion of the produced fluids at the beginning of processing. As properties of the hydrocarbons in the produced fluids change for example TAN asphaltenes P value olefin content mobilized fluids content visbroken fluids content pyrolyzed fluids content or combinations thereof the components may tend to become less soluble in the produced fluids and or in the hydrocarbon stream separated from the produced fluids. In some instances components in the produced fluids and or components in the separated hydrocarbons may form two phases and or become insoluble. Formation of two phases through flocculation of asphaltenes change in concentration of components in the produced fluids change in concentration of components in separated hydrocarbons and or precipitation of components may result in hydrocarbons that do not meet pipeline transportation and or refining specifications. Additionally the efficiency of the process may be reduced. For example further treatment of the produced fluids and or separated hydrocarbons may be necessary to produce products with desired properties.

During processing the P value of the separated hydrocarbons may be monitored and the stability of the produced fluids and or separated hydrocarbons may be assessed. Typically a P value that is at most 1.0 indicates that flocculation of asphaltenes from the separated hydrocarbons generally occurs. If the P value is initially at least 1.0 and such P value increases or is relatively stable during heating then this indicates that the separated hydrocarbons are relatively stabile. Stability of separated hydrocarbons as assessed by P value may be controlled by controlling operating conditions in the formation such as temperature pressure hydrogen uptake hydrocarbon feed flow or combinations thereof.

In some embodiments change in API gravity may not occur unless the formation temperature is at least 100 C. For some formations temperatures of at least 220 C. may be required to produce hydrocarbons that meet desired specifications. At increased temperatures coke formation may occur even at elevated pressures. As the properties of the formation are changed the P value of the separated hydrocarbons may decrease below 1.0 and or sediment may form causing the separated hydrocarbons to become unstable.

In some embodiments olefins may form during heating of formation fluids to produce fluids having a reduced viscosity. Separated hydrocarbons that include olefins may be unacceptable for processing facilities. Olefins in the separated hydrocarbons may cause fouling and or clogging of processing equipment. For example separated hydrocarbons that contains olefins may cause coking of distillation units in a refinery which results in frequent down time to remove the coked material from the distillation units.

During processing the olefin content of separated hydrocarbons may be monitored and quality of the separated hydrocarbons assessed. Typically separated hydrocarbons having a bromine number of 3 and or a CAPP olefin number of 3 as 1 decene equivalent indicates that olefin production is occurring. If the olefin value decreases or is relatively stable during producing then this indicates that a minimal or substantially low amount of olefins are being produced. Olefin content as assessed by bromine value and or CAPP olefin number may be controlled by controlling operating conditions in the formation such as temperature pressure hydrogen uptake hydrocarbon feed flow or combinations thereof.

In some embodiments the P value and or olefin content may be controlled by controlling operating conditions. For example if the temperature increases above 225 C. and the P value drops below 1.0 the separated hydrocarbons may become unstable. Alternatively the bromine number and or CAPP olefin number may increase to above 3 . If the temperature is maintained below 225 C. minimal changes to the hydrocarbon properties may occur. In certain embodiments operating conditions are selected varied and or maintained to produce separated hydrocarbons having a P value of at least about 1 at least about 1.1 at least about 1.2 or at least about 1.3. In certain embodiments operating conditions are selected varied and or maintained to produce separated hydrocarbons having a bromine number of at most about 3 at most about 2.5 at most about 2 or at most about 1.5 . Heating of the formation at controlled operating conditions includes operating at temperatures between about 100 C. and about 260 C. between about 150 C. and about 250 C. between about 200 C. and about 240 C. between about 210 C. and about 230 C. or between about 215 C. and about 225 C. and pressures between about 1000 kPa and about 15000 kPa between about 2000 kPa and about 10000 kPa or between about 2500 kPa and about 5000 kPa or at or near a fracture pressure of the formation. In certain embodiments the selected pressure of about 10000 kPa produces separated hydrocarbons having properties acceptable for transportation and or refineries for example viscosity P value API gravity olefin content or combinations thereof .

Examples of produced mixture properties that may be measured and used to assess the separated hydrocarbon portion of the produced mixture include but are not limited to liquid hydrocarbon properties such as API gravity viscosity asphaltene stability P value and olefin content bromine number and or CAPP number . In certain embodiments operating conditions in the formation are selected varied and or maintained to produce an API gravity of at least about 15 at least about 17 at least about 19 or at least about 20 in the produced mixture. In certain embodiments operating conditions in the formation are selected varied and or maintained to produce a viscosity measured at 1 atm and 5 C. of at most about 400 cp at most about 350 cp at most about 250 cp or at most about 100 cp in the produced mixture. As an example the initial viscosity of fluid in the formation is above about 1000 cp or in some cases above about 1 million cp. In certain embodiments operating conditions are selected varied and or maintained to produce an asphaltene stability P value of at least about 1 at least about 1.1 at least about 1.2 or at least about 1.3 in the produced mixture. In certain embodiments operating conditions are selected varied and or maintained to produce a bromine number of at most about 3 at most about 2.5 at most about 2 or at most about 1.5 in the produced mixture.

In certain embodiments the mixture is produced from one or more production wells located at or near the bottom of the hydrocarbon layer being treated. In other embodiments the mixture is produced from other locations in the hydrocarbon layer being treated for example from an upper portion of the layer or a middle portion of the layer .

In one embodiment the formation is heated to 220 C. or 230 C. while maintaining the pressure in the formation below 10000 kPa. The separated hydrocarbon portion of the mixture produced from the formation may have several desirable properties such as but not limited to an API gravity of at least 19 a viscosity of at most 350 cp a P value of at least 1.1 and a bromine number of at most 2 . Such separated hydrocarbons may be transportable through a pipeline without adding diluent or blending the mixture with another fluid. The mixture may be produced from one or more production wells located at or near the bottom of the hydrocarbon layer being treated.

The in situ heat treatment process may provide less heat to the formation for example use a wider heater spacing if the in situ heat treatment process is followed by a drive process. The drive process may involve introducing a hot fluid into the formation to increase the amount of heat provided to the formation. In some embodiments the heaters of the in situ heat treatment process may be used to pretreat the formation to establish injectivity for the subsequent drive process. In some embodiments the in situ heat treatment process creates or produces the drive fluid in situ. The in situ produced drive fluid may move through the formation and move mobilized hydrocarbons from one portion of the formation to another portion of the formation.

The vertical location of heaters with respect to injection wells and production wells depends on for example the vertical permeability of the formation. In formations with at least some vertical permeability injected steam will rise to the top of the permeable layer in the formation. In such formations heaters may be located near the bottom of the hydrocarbon layer as shown in . In formations with very low vertical permeabilities more than one horizontal heater may be used with the heaters stacked substantially vertically or with heaters at varying depths in the hydrocarbon layer for example heater patterns as shown in . The vertical spacing between the horizontal heaters in such formations may correspond to the distance between the heaters and the injection wells. Heaters are located in the vicinity of injection wells and or production wells so that sufficient energy is delivered by the heaters to provide flow rates for the drive process that are economically viable. The spacing between heaters and injection wells or production wells may be varied to provide an economically viable drive process. The amount of preheating may also be varied to provide an economically viable process.

In some embodiments the steam injection or drive process for example SAGD cyclic steam soak or another steam recovery process is used to treat the formation and produce hydrocarbons from the formation. The steam injection process may recover a low amount of oil in place from the formation for example less than 20 recovery of oil in place from the formation . The in situ heat treatment process may be used following the steam injection process to increase the recovery of oil in place from the formation. In certain embodiments the steam injection process is used until the steam injection process is no longer efficient at removing hydrocarbons from the formation for example until the steam injection process is no longer economically feasible . The in situ heat treatment process is used to produce hydrocarbons remaining in the formation after the steam injection process. Using the in situ heat treatment process after the steam injection process may allow recovery of at least about 25 at least about 50 at least about 55 or at least about 60 of oil in place in the formation.

In some embodiments the formation has been at least somewhat heated by the steam injection process before treating the formation using the in situ heat treatment process. For example the steam injection process may heat the formation to an average temperature between about 200 C. and about 250 C. between about 175 C. and about 265 C. or between about 150 C. and about 270 C. In certain embodiments the heaters are placed in the formation after the steam injection process is at least 50 completed at least 75 completed or near 100 completion of the steam injection process. The heaters provide heat for treating the formation using the in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments the heaters are already in place in the formation during the steam injection process. In such embodiments the heaters may be energized after the steam injection process is completed or when production of hydrocarbons using the steam injection process is reduced below a desired level. In some embodiments steam injection wells from the steam injection process are converted to heater wells for the in situ heat treatment process.

Treating the formation with the in situ heat treatment process after the steam injection process may be more efficient than only treating the formation with the in situ heat treatment process. The steam injection process may provide some energy heat to the formation with the steam. Any energy added to the formation during the steam injection process reduces the amount of energy needed to be supplied by heaters for the in situ heat treatment process. Reducing the amount of energy supplied by heaters reduces costs for treating the formation using the in situ heat treatment process.

In certain embodiments treating the formation using the steam injection process does not treat the formation uniformly. For example steam injection may not be uniform throughout the formation. Variations in the properties of the formation for example fluid injectivities permeabilities and or porosities may result in non uniform injection of the steam through the formation. Because of the non uniform injection of the steam the steam may remove hydrocarbons from different portions of the formation at different rates or with different results. For example some portions of the formation may have little or no steam injectivity which inhibits the hydrocarbon production from these portions. After the steam injection process is completed the formation may have portions that have lower amounts of hydrocarbons produced more hydrocarbons remaining than other parts of the formation.

In some embodiments the portions with more hydrocarbons remaining such as portion depicted in are large portions of the formation. In some embodiments the amount of hydrocarbons remaining in these portions is significantly higher than other portions of the formation such as portions depicted in . For example portions may have a recovery of at most about 10 of the oil in place and portions may have a recovery of at least about 30 of the oil in place. In some embodiments portions have a recovery of between about 0 and about 10 of the oil in place between about 0 and about 15 of the oil in place or between about 0 and about 20 of the oil in place. The portions may have a recovery of between about 20 and about 25 of the oil in place between about 20 and about 40 of the oil in place or between about 20 and about 50 of the oil in place. Coring logging techniques and or seismic imaging may be used to assess hydrocarbons remaining in the formation and assess the location of one or more of the first and or second portions.

In certain embodiments during the in situ heat treatment process more heat is provided to the first portions of the formation that have more hydrocarbons remaining than the second portions with less hydrocarbons remaining. In some embodiments heaters are located in the first portions but not in the second portions. In some embodiments heaters are located in both the first portions and the second portions but the heaters in the first portions are designed or operated to provide more heat than the heaters in the second portions. In some embodiments heaters pass through both first portions and second portions and the heaters are designed or operated to provide more heat in the first portions than the second portions.

In some embodiments steam injection is continued during the in situ heat treatment process. For example steam injection may be continued while liquids are being produced from the formation. The steam injection may increase the production of liquids from the formation. In certain embodiments steam injection may be reduced or stopped when gas production from the formation begins.

In some embodiments the formation is treated using the in situ heat treatment process a significant time after the formation has been treated using the steam injection process. For example the in situ heat treatment process is used 1 year 2 years 3 years or longer for example 10 years to 20 years after a formation has been treated using the steam injection process. During this dormant period heat from the steam injection process may diffuse to cooler parts of the formation and result in a more uniform preheating of the formation prior to in situ heat treatment. The in situ heat treatment process may be used on formations that have been left dormant after the steam injection process treatment because further hydrocarbon production using the steam injection process is not possible and or not economically feasible. In some embodiments the formation remains at least somewhat heated from the steam injection process even after the significant time.

In certain embodiments a fluid is injected into the formation for example a drive fluid or an oxidizing fluid to move hydrocarbons through the formation from a first section to a second section. In some embodiments the hydrocarbons are moved from the first section to the second section through a third section. depicts a side view representation of an embodiment using at least three treatment sections in a tar sands formation. Hydrocarbon layer may be divide into three or more treatment sections. In certain embodiments hydrocarbon layer includes three different types of treatment sections section A section B and section C. Section C and sections A are separated by sections B. Section C sections A and sections B may be horizontally displaced from each other in the formation. In some embodiments one side of section C is adjacent to an edge of the treatment area of the formation or an untreated section of the formation is left on one side of section C before the same or a different pattern is formed on the opposite side of the untreated section.

In certain embodiments sections A and C are heated at or near the same time to similar temperatures for example pyrolysis temperatures . Sections A and C may be heated to mobilize and or pyrolyze hydrocarbons in the sections. The mobilized and or pyrolyzed hydrocarbons may be produced for example through one or more production wells from section A and or section C. Section B may be heated to lower temperatures for example mobilization temperatures . Little or no production of hydrocarbons to the surface may take place through section B. For example sections A and C may be heated to average temperatures of about 300 C. while section B is heated to an average temperature of about 100 C. and no production wells are operated in section B.

In certain embodiments heating and producing hydrocarbons from section C creates fluid injectivity in the section. After fluid injectivity has been created in section C a fluid such as a drive fluid for example steam water or hydrocarbons and or an oxidizing fluid for example air oxygen enriched oxygen or other oxidants may be injected into the section. The fluid may be injected through heaters a production well and or an injection well located in section C. In some embodiments heaters continue to provide heat while the fluid is being injected. In other embodiments heaters may be turned down or off before or during fluid injection.

In some embodiments providing oxidizing fluid such as air to section C causes oxidation of hydrocarbons in the section. For example coked hydrocarbons and or heated hydrocarbons in section C may oxidize if the temperature of the hydrocarbons is above an oxidation ignition temperature. In some embodiments treatment of section C with the heaters creates coked hydrocarbons with substantially uniform porosity and or substantially uniform injectivity so that heating of the section is controllable when oxidizing fluid is introduced to the section. The oxidation of hydrocarbons in section C will maintain the average temperature of the section or increase the average temperature of the section to higher temperatures for example about 400 C. or above .

In some embodiments injection of the oxidizing fluid is used to heat section C and a second fluid is introduced into the formation after or with the oxidizing fluid to create drive fluids in the section. During injection of air excess air and or oxidation products may be removed from section C through one or more production wells. After the formation is raised to a desired temperature a second fluid may be introduced into section C to react with coke and or hydrocarbons and generate drive fluid for example synthesis gas . In some embodiments the second fluid includes water and or steam. Reactions of the second fluid with carbon in the formation may be endothermic reactions that cool the formation. In some embodiments oxidizing fluid is added with the second fluid so that some heating of section C occurs simultaneous with the endothermic reactions. In some embodiments section C may be treated in alternating steps of adding oxidant to heat the formation and then adding second fluid to generate drive fluids.

The generated drive fluids in section C may include steam carbon dioxide carbon monoxide hydrogen methane and or pyrolyzed hydrocarbons. The high temperature in section C and the generation of drive fluid in the section may increase the pressure of the section so the drive fluids move out of the section into adjacent sections. The increased temperature of section C may also provide heat to section B through conductive heat transfer and or convective heat transfer from fluid flow for example hydrocarbons and or drive fluid to section B.

In some embodiments hydrocarbons for example hydrocarbons produced from section C are provided as a portion of the drive fluid. The injected hydrocarbons may include at least some pyrolyzed hydrocarbons such as pyrolyzed hydrocarbons produced from section C. In some embodiments steam or water are provided as a portion of the drive fluid. Providing steam or water in the drive fluid may be used to control temperatures in the formation. For example steam or water may be used to keep temperatures lower in the formation. In some embodiments water injected as the drive fluid is turned into steam in the formation due to the higher temperatures in the formation. The conversion of water to steam may be used to reduce temperatures or maintain lower temperatures in the formation.

Fluids injected in section C may flow towards section B as shown by the arrows in . Fluid movement through the formation transfers heat convectively through hydrocarbon layer into sections B and or A. In addition some heat may transfer conductively through the hydrocarbon layer between the sections.

Low level heating of section B mobilizes hydrocarbons in the section. The mobilized hydrocarbons in section B may be moved by the injected fluid through the section towards section A as shown by the arrows in . Thus the injected fluid is pushing hydrocarbons from section C through section B to section A. Mobilized hydrocarbons may be upgraded in section A due to the higher temperatures in the section. Pyrolyzed hydrocarbons that move into section A may also be further upgraded in the section. The upgraded hydrocarbons may be produced through production wells located in section A.

In certain embodiments at least some hydrocarbons in section B are mobilized and drained from the section prior to injecting the fluid into the formation. Some formations may have high oil saturation for example the Grosmont formation has high oil saturation . The high oil saturation corresponds to low gas permeability in the formation that may inhibit fluid flow through the formation. Thus mobilizing and draining removing some oil hydrocarbons from the formation may create gas permeability for the injected fluids.

Fluids in hydrocarbon layer may preferentially move horizontally within the hydrocarbon layer from the point of injection because tar sands tend to have a larger horizontal permeability than vertical permeability. The higher horizontal permeability allows the injected fluid to move hydrocarbons between sections preferentially versus fluids draining vertically due to gravity in the formation. Providing sufficient fluid pressure with the injected fluid may ensure that fluids are moved to section A for upgrading and or production.

In certain embodiments section B has a larger volume than section A and or section C. Section B may be larger in volume than the other sections so that more hydrocarbons are produced for less energy input into the formation. Because less heat is provided to section B the section is heated to lower temperatures having a larger volume in section B reduces the total energy input to the formation per unit volume. The desired volume of section B may depend on factors such as but not limited to viscosity oil saturation and permeability. In addition the degree of coking is much less in section B due to the lower temperature so less hydrocarbons are coked in the formation when section B has a larger volume. In some embodiments the lower degree of heating in section B allows for cheaper capital costs as lower temperature materials cheaper materials may be used for heaters used in section B.

In some embodiments karsted formations or karsted layers in formations have vugs in one or more layers of the formations. The vugs may be filled with viscous fluids such as bitumen or heavy oil. In some embodiments the karsted layers have a porosity of at least about 20 porosity units at least about 30 porosity units or at least about 35 porosity units. The karsted formation may have a porosity of at most about 15 porosity units at most about 10 porosity units or at most about 5 porosity units. Vugs filled with viscous fluids may inhibit steam or other fluids from being injected into the formation or the layers. In certain embodiments the karsted formation or karsted layers of the formation are treated using the in situ heat treatment process.

Heating of these formations or layers may decrease the viscosity of the viscous fluids in the vugs and allow the fluids to drain for example mobilize the fluids . Formations with karsted layers may have sufficient permeability so that when the viscosity of fluids hydrocarbons in the formation is reduced the fluids drain and or move through the formation relatively easily for example without a need for creating higher permeability in the formation .

In some embodiments the relative amount the degree of karst in the formation is assessed using techniques known in the art for example 3D seismic imaging of the formation . The assessment may give a profile of the formation showing layers or portions with varying amounts of karst in the formation. In certain embodiments more heat is provided to selected karsted portions of the formation than other karsted portions of the formation. In some embodiments selective amounts of heat are provided to portions of the formation as a function of the degree of karst in the portions. Amounts of heat may be provided by varying the number and or density of heaters in the portions with varying degrees of karst.

In certain embodiments the hydrocarbon fluids in karsted portions have higher viscosities than hydrocarbons in other non karsted portions of the formation. Thus more heat may be provided to the karsted portions to reduce the viscosity of the hydrocarbons in the karsted portions.

In certain embodiments only the karsted layers of the formation are treated using the in situ heat treatment process. Other non karsted layers of the formation may be used as seals for the in situ heat treatment process. For example karsted layers with different quantities of hydrocarbons in the layers may be treated while other layers are used as natural seals for the treatment process. In some embodiments karsted layers with low quantities of hydrocarbons as compared to the other karsted and or non karsted layers are used as seals for the treatment process. The quantity of hydrocarbons in the karsted layer may be determined using logging methods and or Dean Stark distillation methods. The quantity of hydrocarbons may be reported as a volume percent of hydrocarbons per volume percent of rock or as volume of hydrocarbons per mass of rock.

In some embodiments karsted layers with fewer hydrocarbons are treated along with karsted layers with more hydrocarbons. In some embodiments karsted layers with fewer hydrocarbons are above and below a karsted layer with more hydrocarbons the middle karsted layer . Less heat may be provided to the upper and lower karsted layers than the middle karsted layer. Less heat may be provided in the upper and lower karsted layers by having greater heat spacing and or less heaters in the upper and lower karsted layers as compared to the middle karsted layer. In some embodiments less heating of the upper and lower karsted layers includes heating the layers to mobilization and or visbreaking temperatures but not to pyrolysis temperatures. In some embodiments the upper and or lower karsted layers are heated with heaters and the residual heat from the upper and or lower layers transfers to the middle layer.

One or more production wells may be located in the middle karsted layer. Mobilized and or visbroken hydrocarbons from the upper karsted layer may drain to the production wells in the middle karsted layer. Heat provided to the lower karsted layer may create a thermal expansion drive and or a gas pressure drive in the lower karsted layer. The thermal expansion and or gas pressure may drive fluids from the lower karsted layer to the middle karsted layer. These fluids may be produced through the production wells in the middle karsted layer. Providing some heat to the upper and lower karsted layers may increase the total recovery of fluids from the formation by for example 25 or more.

In some embodiments the karsted layers with fewer hydrocarbons are further heated to pyrolysis temperatures after production from the karsted layer with more hydrocarbons is completed or almost completed. The karsted layers with fewer hydrocarbons may also be further treated by producing fluids through production wells located in the layers.

In some embodiments a drive process a solvent injection process and or a pressurizing fluid process is used after the in situ heat treatment of the karsted formation or karsted layers. A drive process may include injection of a drive fluid such as steam. A drive process includes but is not limited to a steam injection process such as cyclic steam injection a steam assisted gravity drainage process SAGD and a vapor solvent and SAGD process. A drive process may drive fluids from one portion of the formation towards a production well.

A solvent injection process may include injection of a solvating fluid. A solvating fluid includes but is not limited to water emulsified water hydrocarbons surfactants alkaline water solutions for example sodium carbonate solutions caustic polymers carbon disulfide carbon dioxide or mixtures thereof. The solvation fluid may mix with solvate and or dilute the hydrocarbons to form a mixture of condensable hydrocarbons and solvation fluids. The mixture may have a reduced viscosity as compared to the initial viscosity of the fluids in the formation. The mixture may flow and or be mobilized towards production wells in the formation.

A pressurizing process may include moving hydrocarbons in the formation by injection of a pressurized fluid. The pressurizing fluid may include but is not limited to carbon dioxide nitrogen steam methane and or mixtures thereof.

In some embodiments the drive process for example the steam injection process is used to mobilize fluids before the in situ heat treatment process. Steam injection may be used to get hydrocarbons oil away from rock or other strata in the formation. The steam injection may mobilize the hydrocarbons without significantly heating the rock.

In some embodiments fluid injected in the formation for example steam and or carbon dioxide may absorb heat from the formation and cool the formation depending on the pressure in the formation and the temperature of the injected fluid. In some embodiments the injected fluid is used to recover heat from the formation. The recovered heat may be used in surface processing fluids and or to preheat other portions of the formation using the drive process.

In some embodiments heaters are used to preheat the karsted formation or karsted layers to create injectivity in the formation. In situ heat treatment of karsted formations and or karsted layers may allow for drive fluid injection solvent injection and or pressurizing fluid injection where it was previously unfavorable or unmanageable. Typically karsted formations were unfavorable for drive processes because channeling of the fluid injected in the formation inhibited pressure build up in the formation. In situ heat treatment of karsted formations may allow for injection of a drive fluid a solvent and or a pressurizing fluid by reducing the viscosity of hydrocarbons in the formation and allowing pressure to build in the formations without significant bypass of the fluid through channels in the formations. For example heating a section of the formation using in situ heat treatment may heat and mobilize heavy hydrocarbons bitumen by reducing the viscosity of the heavy hydrocarbons in the karsted layer. Some of the heated less viscous heavy hydrocarbons may flow from the karsted layer into other portions of the formation that are cooler than the heated karsted portion. The heated less viscous heavy hydrocarbons may flow through channels and or fractures. The heated heavy hydrocarbons may cool and solidify in the channels thus creating a temporary seal for the drive fluid solvent and or pressurizing fluid.

In certain embodiments the karsted formation or karsted layers are heated to temperatures below the decomposition temperature of minerals in the formation for example rock minerals such as dolomite and or clay minerals such as kaolinite illite or smectite . In some embodiments the karsted formation or karsted layers are heated to temperatures of at most 400 C. at most 450 C. or at most 500 C. for example to a temperature below a dolomite decomposition temperature at formation pressure . In some embodiments the karsted formation or karsted layers are heated to temperatures below a decomposition temperature of clay minerals such as kaolinite at formation pressure.

In some embodiments heat is preferentially provided to portions of the formation with low weight percentages of clay minerals for example kaolinite as compared to the content of clay in other portions of the formation. For example more heat may be provided to portions of the formation with at most 1 by weight clay minerals at most 2 by weight clay minerals or at most 3 by weight clay minerals than portions of the formation with higher weight percentages of clay minerals. In some embodiments the rock and or clay mineral distribution is assessed in the formation prior to designing a heater pattern and installing the heaters. The heaters may be arranged to preferentially provide heat to the portions of the formation that have been assessed to have lower weight percentages of clay minerals as compared to other portions of the formation. In certain embodiments the heaters are placed substantially horizontally in layers with low weight percentages of clay minerals.

Providing heat to portions with low weight percentages of clay minerals may minimize changes in the chemical structure of the clays. For example heating clays to high temperatures may drive water from the clays and change the structure of the clays. The change in structure of the clay may adversely affect the porosity and or permeability of the formation. If the clays are heated in the presence of air the clays may oxidize and the porosity and or permeability of the formation may be adversely affected. Portions of the formation with a high weight percentage of clay minerals may be inhibited from reaching temperatures above temperatures that effect the chemical composition of the clay minerals at formation pressures. For example portions of the formation with large amounts of kaolinite relative to other portions of the formation may be inhibited from reaching temperatures above 240 C. In some embodiments portions of the formation with a high quantity of clay minerals relative to other portions of the formation may be inhibited from reaching temperatures above 200 C. above 220 C. above 240 C. or above 300 C.

In some embodiments karsted formations may include water. Minerals for example carbonate minerals in the formation may at least partially dissociate in the water to form carbonic acid. The concentration of carbonic acid in the water may be sufficient to make the water acidic. At pressure greater than ambient formation pressures dissolution of minerals in the water may be enhanced thus formation of acidic water is enhanced. Acidic water may react with other minerals in the formation such as dolomite MgCa CO and increase the solubility of the minerals. Water at lower pressures or non acidic water may not solubilize the minerals in the formation. Dissolution of the minerals in the formation may form fractures in the formation. Thus controlling the pressure and or the acidity of water in the formation may control the solubilization of minerals in the formation. In some embodiments other inorganic acids in the formation enhance the solubilization of minerals such as dolomite.

In some embodiments the karsted formation or karsted layers are heated to temperatures above the decomposition temperature of minerals in the formation. At temperatures above the minerals decomposition temperature the minerals may decompose to produce carbon dioxide or other products. The decomposition of the minerals and the carbon dioxide production may create permeability in the formation and mobilize viscous fluids in the formation. In some embodiments the produced carbon dioxide is maintained in the formation to generate a gas cap in the formation. The carbon dioxide may be allowed to rise to the upper portions of the karsted layers to generate the gas cap.

In some embodiments the production front of the drive process follows behind the heat front of the in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments areas behind the production front are further heated to produce more fluids from the formation. Further heating behind the production front may also maintain the gas cap behind the production front and or maintain quality in the production front of the drive process.

In certain embodiments the drive process is used before the in situ heat treatment of the formation. In some embodiments the drive process is used to mobilize fluids in a first section of the formation. The mobilized fluids may then be pushed into a second section by heating the first section with heaters. Fluids may be produced from the second section. In some embodiments the fluids in the second section are pyrolyzed and or upgraded using the heaters.

In formations with low permeabilities the drive process may be used to create a gas cushion or pressure sink before the in situ heat treatment process. The gas cushion may inhibit pressures from increasing quickly to fracture pressure during the in situ heat treatment process. The gas cushion may provide a path for gases to escape or travel during early stages of heating during the in situ heat treatment process.

In some embodiments the drive process for example the steam injection process is used to mobilize fluids before the in situ heat treatment process. Steam injection may be used to get hydrocarbons oil away from rock or other strata in the formation. The steam injection may mobilize the oil without significantly heating the rock.

In some embodiments injection of a fluid for example steam or carbon dioxide may consume heat in the formation and cool the formation depending on the pressure in the formation. In some embodiments the injected fluid is used to recover heat from the formation. The recovered heat may be used in surface processing fluids and or to preheat other portions of the formation using the drive process.

Heaters are used to heat the second portion of hydrocarbon layer to mobilization visbreaking and or pyrolysis temperatures. Second hydrocarbons are produced from the second portion through production well B. In some embodiments the second hydrocarbons include at least some pyrolyzed hydrocarbons. In certain embodiments the second hydrocarbons have an API gravity of at least 15 at least 20 or at least 25 .

In some embodiments the first portion of hydrocarbon layer is treated using heaters after the steam injection process. Heaters may be used to increase the temperature of the first portion and or treat the first portion using an in situ heat treatment process. Second hydrocarbons including at least some pyrolyzed hydrocarbons may be produced from the first portion through production well A.

In some embodiments the second portion of hydrocarbon layer is treated using the steam injection process before using heaters to treat the second portion. The steam injection process may be used to produce some fluids for example first hydrocarbons or hydrocarbons mobilized by the steam injection through production well B from the second portion and or preheat the second portion before using heaters . In some embodiments the steam injection process may be used after using heaters to treat the first portion and or the second portion.

Producing hydrocarbons through both processes increases the total recovery of hydrocarbons from hydrocarbon layer and may be more economical than using either process alone. In some embodiments the first portion is treated with the in situ heat treatment process after the steam injection process is completed. For example after the steam injection process no longer produces viable amounts of hydrocarbon from the first portion the in situ heat treatment process may be used on the first portion.

Steam is provided to injection well from facility . Facility is a steam and electricity cogeneration facility. Facility may burn hydrocarbons in generators to make electricity. Facility may burn gaseous and or liquid hydrocarbons to make electricity. The electricity generated is used to provide electrical power for heaters . Waste heat from the generators is used to make steam. In some embodiments some of the hydrocarbons produced from the formation are used to provide gas for heaters if the heaters utilize gas to provide heat to the formation. The amount of electricity and steam generated by facility may be controlled to vary the production rate and or quality of hydrocarbons produced from the first portion and or the second portion of hydrocarbon layer . The production rate and or quality of hydrocarbons produced from the first portion and or the second portion may be varied to produce a selected API gravity in a mixture made by blending the first hydrocarbons with the second hydrocarbons. The first hydrocarbon and the second hydrocarbons may be blended after production to produce the selected API gravity. The production from the first portion and or the second portion may be varied in response to changes in the marketplace for either first hydrocarbons second hydrocarbons and or a mixture of the first and second hydrocarbons.

First hydrocarbons produced from production well A and or second hydrocarbons produced from production well B may be used as fuel for facility . In some embodiments first hydrocarbons and or second hydrocarbons are treated for example removing undesirable products before being used as fuel for facility . In some embodiments coke or other hydrocarbon residue produced or removed from the formation for example mined from the formation may provide fuel for facility . The hydrocarbon residue may be gasified or burned in a residue burning facility before providing the hydrocarbons to facility . The residue burning facility may produce hydrocarbon gases such as natural gas and or other products such as carbon dioxide or syngas products synthesis gas products . The carbon dioxide may be sequestered in the formation after treatment of the formation.

The amount of first hydrocarbons and second hydrocarbons used as fuel for facility may be determined for example by economics for the overall process the marketplace for either first or second hydrocarbons availability of treatment facilities for either first or second hydrocarbons and or transportation facilities available for either first or second hydrocarbons. In some embodiments most or all the hydrocarbon gas produced from hydrocarbon layer is used as fuel for facility . Burning all the hydrocarbon gas in facility eliminates the need for treatment and or transportation of gases produced from hydrocarbon layer .

The produced first hydrocarbons and the second hydrocarbons may be treated and or blended in facility . In some embodiments the first and second hydrocarbons are blended to make a mixture that is transportable through a pipeline. In some embodiments the first and second hydrocarbons are blended to make a mixture that is useable as a feedstock for a refinery. The amount of first and second hydrocarbons produced may be varied based on changes in the requirements for treatment and or blending of the hydrocarbons. In some embodiments treated hydrocarbons are used in facility .

In some embodiments the steam injection process and the in situ heat treatment process for example the in situ conversion process are used synergistically in different layers for example vertically displaced layers in the formation. For example in a karsted formation different zones or layers in the formation may have different oil saturations water saturations porosities and or permeabilities. Some layers may have good steam injectivities while others have near zero steam injectivity. The steam injectivity may depend on the water saturation of the zone and the permeability. Thus varying the use of the steam injection process and the in situ heat treatment process in these layers may be economically advantageous by for example producing more hydrocarbons with less energy input into the formation. The steam injection process may include steam drive cyclic steam injection SAGD or other process of steam injection into the formation.

Injecting steam into hydrocarbon layers A C above and below hydrocarbon layer B may increase the efficiency of producing hydrocarbons from the formation. Steam injection in hydrocarbon layers A C lowers the viscosity and increases the pressures in these layers so that hydrocarbons move into hydrocarbon layer B. Heat from hydrocarbon layer B may conduct and or convect into hydrocarbon layers A C and preheat these layers to lower the oil viscosity and or increase the steam injectivity in hydrocarbon layers A C. Additionally some steam may rise from hydrocarbon layer C into hydrocarbon layer B. This steam may provide additional heat and increased mobilization in hydrocarbon layer B. The steam injection process and or the in situ heat treatment process may be used for example varied as described above for the embodiment depicted in . Hydrocarbons produced from any of hydrocarbon layers A B C may be used and or processed in facility and or facility as described above for the embodiment depicted in .

In some embodiments impermeable shale layers exist between hydrocarbon layer B and hydrocarbon layers A C. Using the in situ heat treatment process on hydrocarbon layer B may desiccate the shale layers and increase the permeability of the shale layers to allow fluid to flow through the shale layers. The increased permeability in the shale layers allows mobilized hydrocarbons to flow from hydrocarbon layer A into hydrocarbon layer B. These hydrocarbons may be upgraded and produced in hydrocarbon layer B.

Conduit may be made from carbon steel or more corrosion resistant materials such as stainless steel. Conduit may include apparatus and mechanisms for gas lifting or pumping produced oil to the surface. For example conduit includes gas lift valves used in a gas lift process. Examples of gas lift control systems and valves are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 715 550 to Vinegar et al. and 7 259 688 to Hirsch et al. and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002 0036085 to Bass et al. each of which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. Conduit may include one or more openings perforations to allow fluid to flow into the production conduit. In certain embodiments the openings in conduit are in a portion of the conduit that remains below the liquid level in wellbore . For example the openings are in a horizontal portion of conduit .

Heater is located in conduit as shown in . In some embodiments heater is located outside conduit as shown in . The heater located outside the production conduit may be coupled strapped to the production conduit. In some embodiments more than one heater for example two three or four heaters are placed about conduit . The use of more than one heater may reduce bowing or flexing of the production conduit caused by heating on only one side of the production conduit. In an embodiment heater is a temperature limited heater. Heater provides heat to reduce the viscosity of fluid such as oil or hydrocarbons in and near wellbore . In certain embodiments heater raises the temperature of the fluid in wellbore up to a temperature of 250 C. or less for example 225 C. 200 C. or 150 C. . Heater may be at higher temperatures for example 275 C. 300 C. or 325 C. because the heater provides heat to conduit and there is some temperature differential between the heater and the conduit. Thus heat produced from the heater does not raise the temperature of fluids in the wellbore above 250 C.

In certain embodiments heater includes ferromagnetic materials such as Carpenter Temperature Compensator 32 Alloy 42 6 Alloy 52 Invar 36 or other iron nickel or iron nickel chromium alloys. In certain embodiments nickel or nickel chromium alloys are used in heater . In some embodiments heater includes a composite conductor with a more highly conductive material such as copper on the inside of the heater to improve the turndown ratio of the heater. Heat from heater heats fluids in or near wellbore to reduce the viscosity of the fluids and increase a production rate through conduit .

In certain embodiments portions of heater above the liquid level in wellbore such as the vertical portion of the wellbore depicted in have a lower maximum temperature than portions of the heater located below the liquid level. For example portions of heater above the liquid level in wellbore may have a maximum temperature of 100 C. while portions of the heater located below the liquid level have a maximum temperature of 250 C. In certain embodiments such a heater includes two or more ferromagnetic sections with different Curie temperatures and or phase transformation temperature ranges to achieve the desired heating pattern. Providing less heat to portions of wellbore above the liquid level and closer to the surface may save energy.

In certain embodiments heater is electrically isolated on the outside surface of the heater and allowed to move freely in conduit . In some embodiments electrically insulating centralizers are placed on the outside of heater to maintain a gap between conduit and the heater.

In some embodiments heater is cycled turned on and off so that fluids produced through conduit are not overheated. In an embodiment heater is turned on for a specified amount of time until a temperature of fluids in or near wellbore reaches a desired temperature for example the maximum temperature of the heater . During the heating time for example 10 days 20 days or 30 days production through conduit may be stopped to allow fluids in the formation to soak and obtain a reduced viscosity. After heating is turned off or reduced production through conduit is started and fluids from the formation are produced without excess heat being provided to the fluids. During production fluids in or near wellbore will cool down without heat from heater being provided. When the fluids reach a temperature at which production significantly slows down production is stopped and heater is turned back on to reheat the fluids. This process may be repeated until a desired amount of production is reached. In some embodiments some heat at a lower temperature is provided to maintain a flow of the produced fluids. For example low temperature heat for example 100 C. 125 C. or 150 C. may be provided in the upper portions of wellbore to keep fluids from cooling to a lower temperature.

In some embodiments a temperature limited heater positioned in a wellbore heats steam that is provided to the wellbore. The heated steam may be introduced into a portion of the formation. In certain embodiments the heated steam may be used as a heat transfer fluid to heat a portion of the formation. In some embodiments the steam is used to solution mine desired minerals from the formation. In some embodiments the temperature limited heater positioned in the wellbore heats liquid water that is introduced into a portion of the formation.

In an embodiment the temperature limited heater includes ferromagnetic material with a selected Curie temperature and or a selected phase transformation temperature range. The use of a temperature limited heater may inhibit a temperature of the heater from increasing beyond a maximum selected temperature for example a temperature at or about the Curie temperature and or the phase transformation temperature range . Limiting the temperature of the heater may inhibit potential burnout of the heater. The maximum selected temperature may be a temperature selected to heat the steam to above or near 100 saturation conditions superheated conditions or supercritical conditions. Using a temperature limited heater to heat the steam may inhibit overheating of the steam in the wellbore. Steam introduced into a formation may be used for synthesis gas production to heat the hydrocarbon containing formation to carry chemicals into the formation to extract chemicals or minerals from the formation and or to control heating of the formation.

A portion of the formation where steam is introduced or that is heated with steam may be at significant depths below the surface for example greater than about 1000 m about 2500 or about 5000 m below the surface . If steam is heated at the surface of the formation and introduced to the formation through a wellbore a quality of the heated steam provided to the wellbore at the surface may have to be relatively high to accommodate heat losses to the wellbore casing and or the overburden as the steam travels down the wellbore. Heating the steam in the wellbore may allow the quality of the steam to be significantly improved before the steam is provided to the formation. A temperature limited heater positioned in a lower section of the overburden and or adjacent to a target zone of the formation may be used to controllably heat steam to improve the quality of the steam injected into the formation and or inhibit condensation along the length of the heater. In certain embodiments the temperature limited heater improves the quality of the steam injected and or inhibits condensation in the wellbore for long steam injection wellbores especially for long horizontal steam injection wellbores .

A temperature limited heater positioned in a wellbore may be used to heat the steam to above or near 100 saturation conditions or superheated conditions. In some embodiments a temperature limited heater may heat the steam so that the steam is above or near supercritical conditions. The static head of fluid above the temperature limited heater may facilitate producing 100 saturation superheated and or supercritical conditions in the steam. Supercritical or near supercritical steam may be used to strip hydrocarbon material and or other materials from the formation. In certain embodiments steam introduced into the formation may have a high density for example a specific gravity of about 0.8 or above . Increasing the density of the steam may improve the ability of the steam to strip hydrocarbon material and or other materials from the formation.

In some embodiments the tar sands formation may be treated by the in situ heat treatment process to produce pyrolyzed product from the formation. A significant amount of carbon in the form of coke may remain in tar sands formation when production of pyrolysis product from the formation is complete. In some embodiments the coke in the formation may be utilized to produce heat and or additional products from the heated coke containing portions of the formation.

In some embodiments air oxygen enriched air and or other oxidants may be introduced into the treatment area that has been pyrolyzed to react with the coke in the treatment area. The temperature of the treatment area may be sufficiently hot to support burning of the coke without additional energy input from heaters. The oxidation of the coke may significantly heat the portion of the formation. Some of the heat may transfer to portions of the formation adjacent to the treatment area. The transferred heat may mobilize fluids in portions of the formation adjacent to the treatment area. The mobilized fluids may flow into and be produced from production wells near the perimeter of the treatment area.

Gases produced from the formation heated by combusting coke in the formation may be at high temperature. The hot gases may be utilized in an energy recovery cycle for example a Kalina cycle or a Rankine cycle to produce electricity.

The air oxygen enriched air and or other oxidants may be introduced into the formation for a sufficiently long period of time to heat a portion of the treatment area to a desired temperature sufficient to allow for the production of synthesis gas of a desired composition. The temperature may be from 500 C. to about 1000 C. or higher. When the temperature of the portion is at or near the desired temperature a synthesis gas generating fluid such as water may be introduced into the formation to result in the formation of synthesis gas. Synthesis gas produced from the formation may be sent to a treatment facility and or be sent through a pipeline to a desired location. During introduction of the synthesis gas generating fluid the introduction of air oxygen enriched air and or other oxidants may be stopped reduced or maintained. If the temperature of the formation reduces so that the synthesis gas produced from the formation does not have the desired composition introduction of the syntheses gas generating fluid may be stopped or reduced and the introduction of air enriched air and or other oxidants may be started or increased so that oxidation of coke in the formation reheats portions of the treatment area. The introduction of oxidant to heat the formation and the introduction of synthesis gas generating fluid to produce synthesis gas may be cycled until all or a significant portion of the treatment area is treated.

In certain embodiments a tar sands formation is treated in stages. The treatment may be initiated with electrical heating with further heating generated from oxidation of hydrocarbons and hot gas production from the formation. depicts an embodiment of a first stage of treating the tar sands formation with electrical heaters. Hydrocarbon layer may be separated into sections A B. Heaters may be located in section A. Production wells may be located in section B. In some embodiments production wells overlap into section A as shown in .

Heaters may be used to heat and treat portions of section A through conductive heat transfer. For example heaters may mobilize visbreak and or pyrolyze hydrocarbons in section A. Production wells may be used to produce mobilized visbroken and or pyrolyzed hydrocarbons from section A.

Injection wells may be used to inject air or other oxidizing fluids and or water into the formation. In some embodiments carbon dioxide or other fluids are injected into the formation to control heating production in the formation. Air or oxidizing fluids may oxidize combust hydrocarbons remaining in the formation for example coke . Water may react with the hot formation to produce syngas in the formation. Production wells in section B may be converted to gas heater producer wells . Wells may be used to produce oxidation gases and or syngas products from the formation. Producing the hot oxidation gases and or syngas through wells in section B may heat the section to higher temperatures so that hydrocarbons in the section are mobilized visbroken and or pyrolyzed in the section. Production wells in section C may be used to produce mobilized visbroken and or pyrolyzed hydrocarbons from section B.

In certain embodiments the pressure of the injected fluids and the pressure in formation are controlled to control the heating in the formation. The pressure in the formation may be controlled by controlling the production rate of fluids from the formation for example the production rate of oxidation gases and or syngas products . Heating in the formation may be controlled so that there is enough hydrocarbon volume in the formation to maintain the oxidation reactions in the formation. Heating in the formation may also be controlled so that enough heat is generated to conductively heat the formation to mobilize visbreak and or pyrolyze hydrocarbons in adjacent sections of the formation.

The process of injecting air and or water one section producing oxidation gases and or syngas products in an adjacent section to heat the adjacent section and producing upgraded hydrocarbons mobilized visbroken and or pyrolyzed hydrocarbons from a subsequent section may be continued in further sections of the tar sands formation. For example depicts an embodiment of a third stage of treating the tar sands formation with fluid injection and oxidation. The gas heater producer wells in section B are converted to injection wells to inject air and or water. The producer wells in section C are converted to gas heater producer wells to produce oxidation gases and or syngas products. Producer wells are formed in section D to produce upgraded hydrocarbons.

Treating the tar sands formation as shown by the embodiments of and may utilize carbon remaining after production of mobilized visbroken and or pyrolyzed hydrocarbons for heat generation in the formation. Using the remaining hydrocarbons for heat generation and only using electrical heating for the initial heating stage may improve the energy balance for treating the formation. Using electrical heating only in the initial step may decrease the electrical power needs for treating the formation. In addition forming wells that are used for the combination of production injection and gas heating production may decrease well construction costs. In some embodiments hot gases produced from the formation are provided to turbines. Providing the hot gases to turbines may collect more energy from the hot gases and thus improve energy collection from the formation.

A downhole heater assembly may include 5 10 20 40 or more heaters coupled together. For example a heater assembly may include between 10 and 40 heaters. Heaters in a downhole heater assembly may be coupled in series. In some embodiments heaters in a heater assembly may be spaced from about 8 meters about 25 feet to about 60 meters about 195 feet apart. For example heaters in a heater assembly may be spaced about 15 meters about 50 feet apart. Spacing between heaters in a heater assembly may be a function of heat transfer from the heaters to the formation. Spacing between heaters may be chosen to limit temperature variation along a length of a heater assembly to acceptable limits. Heaters in a heater assembly may include but are not limited to electrical heaters flameless distributed combustors natural distributed combustors and or oxidizers. In some embodiments heaters in a downhole heater assembly may include only oxidizers.

Oxidizing fluid may be supplied to oxidizer assembly through oxidant conduit . In some embodiments fuel conduit and or oxidizers may be positioned concentrically or substantially concentrically in oxidant conduit . In some embodiments fuel conduit and or oxidizers may be arranged other than concentrically with respect to oxidant conduit . In certain branched opening embodiments fuel conduit and or oxidant conduit may have a weld or coupling to allow placement of oxidizer assemblies in branches of the opening. Exhaust gas may pass through outer conduit and out of the formation.

In some embodiments the downhole oxidizer assembly includes a water conduit positioned in the oxidant conduit that is configured to deliver water to the fuel conduit prior to the first oxidizer in the oxidizer assembly. A portion of the water conduit may pass through a heated zone generated by the first oxidizer prior to a water entry point into the fuel conduit. In some embodiments the fuel conduit is positioned adjacent to the oxidizers and branches from the fuel conduit provide fuel to the other oxidizers. In some embodiments the fuel conduit may comprise one or more orifices to selectively control the pressure loss along the fuel conduit.

Fuel may be supplied to oxidizers through fuel conduit . In some embodiments the fuel for the oxidizers includes synthesis gas. In some embodiments the fuel includes synthesis gas for example a mixture that includes hydrogen and carbon monoxide that was produced using an in situ heat treatment process. In certain embodiments the fuel may comprise natural gas mixed with heavier components such as ethane propane butane or carbon monoxide. In some embodiments the fuel and or synthesis gas may include non combustible gases such as nitrogen. In some embodiments the fuel contains products from a coal or heavy oil gasification process. The coal or heavy oil gasification process may be an in situ process or an ex situ process. After initiation of combustion of fuel and oxidant mixture in oxidizers composition of the fuel may be varied to enhance operational stability of the oxidizers.

In certain embodiments fuel used to initiate combustion may be enriched to decrease the temperature required for ignition or otherwise facilitate startup of oxidizers . In some embodiments hydrogen or other hydrogen rich fluids may be used to enrich fuel initially supplied to the oxidizers. After ignition of the oxidizers enrichment of the fuel may be stopped. In some embodiments a portion or portions of fuel conduit may include a catalytic surface for example a catalytic outer surface to decrease an ignition temperature of fuel .

In some embodiments non condensable gases produced from treatment areas of in situ heat treatment processes are used as fuel for heaters that heat treatment areas in the formation. The heaters may be burners. The burners may be oxidizers of downhole oxidizer assemblies flameless distributed combustors and or burners that heat a heat transfer fluid used to heat the treatment areas. The non condensable gases may include combustible gases for example hydrogen hydrogen sulfide methane and other hydrocarbon gases and noncombustible gases for example carbon dioxide . The presence of noncombustible gases may inhibit coking of the fuel and or may reduce the flame zone temperature of oxidizers when the fuel is used as fuel for oxidizers of downhole oxidizer assemblies. The reduced flame zone temperature may inhibit formation of NOcompounds and or other undesired combustion products by the oxidizers. Other components such as water may be included in the fuel supplied to the burners. Combustion of in situ heat treatment process gas may reduce and or eliminate the need for gas treatment facilities and or the need to treat the non condensable portion of formation fluid produced using the in situ heat treatment process to obtain pipeline gas and or other gas products. Combustion of in situ heat treatment process gas in burners may create concentrated carbon dioxide and or SOeffluents that may be used in other processes sequestered and or treated to remove undesired components.

In some embodiments use of non condensable fluids from in situ heat treatment processes in burners reduces or eliminates the need to build power plants near the in situ heat treatment processes. Heat initially used to increase the temperature of treatment areas in the formation may be provided by burning pipeline gas or other fuel. After the formation begins producing formation fluid a portion or all of the non condensable fluids produced from the formation may replace or supplement the pipeline gas or other fuel used to heat treatment areas.

In some embodiments the oxidizing fluid supplied to the burners is air or enriched air. In some embodiments the oxidizing fluid is produced by blending oxygen with a carrier fluid such as carbon dioxide to reduce or eliminate the presence of nitrogen in the oxidizing fluid. For example the oxidizing fluid may be about 50 by volume oxygen and about 50 by volume carbon dioxide. Eliminating or reducing nitrogen in the oxidizing fluid may eliminate or reduce the amount of NOcompounds generated by the burners. Eliminating or educing nitrogen in the oxidizing fluid may also enable transporting and geologically storing exhaust gases from the burners without having to separate nitrogen from the exhaust gases.

Fuel may enter fuel conduit that provides fuel to oxidizers of oxidizer assemblies for example a plurality of oxidizer assemblies such as downhole oxidizer assembly depicted in that heat treatment area . Air stream and or diluent fluid may be mixed with oxidizing fluid to form mixed oxidizing fluid that is provided to the oxidizers of the downhole oxidizing assemblies. Diluent fluid may be but is not limited to carbon oxides separated from in situ heat treatment process gas a portion of stream from gas separation unit carbon dioxide from the exhaust of the downhole oxidizing assemblies separated gas streams from gas separation systems described in or mixtures thereof. In some embodiments diluent fluid includes sufficient amounts of carbon dioxide to inhibit oxidation of conduits and or metal parts in fuel conduit that come in contact with oxidizing fluid . In some embodiments the amount of excess oxidant supplied to the downhole oxidizers is reduced to less than about 50 excess oxidant by volume by mixing oxidizing fluid with the diluent fluid .

Initially pipeline gas or other fuel may be supplied to treatment area . Valves may be adjusted to control the amount of initial fuel supplied to treatment area as fuel becomes available. Initially air stream may be supplied to treatment area as the oxidizing fluid. After additional oxidant sources become available valves may be adjusted to control the composition of oxidizing fluid provided to treatment area .

Exhaust gas from burners used to heat treatment area may be directed to exhaust treatment unit . Exhaust gas may include but is not limited to carbon dioxide and or SO. In exhaust separation unit carbon dioxide stream is separated from SOstream . Separated carbon dioxide stream may be mixed with diluent fluid may be used as a carrier fluid for oxidizing fluid may be used as a drive fluid for producing hydrocarbons and or may be sequestered. SOstream may be treated using known SOtreatment methods for example sent to a Claus plant . Formation fluid produced from heat treatment area may be mixed with formation fluid from other treatment areas and or formation fluid may enter separation unit .

In some embodiments onsite production of oxygen gas is desirable. Production of oxygen gas at or proximate downhole oxidizer assemblies may reduce production costs and or enhance efficiency of operation of the production of formation fluids. Oxygen gas may be produced by separation of oxygen from air using cryogenic and or non cryogenic systems. Non cryogenic systems include but are not limited to pressure swing adsorption vacuum swing adsorption vacuum pressure swing adsorption membranes or combinations thereof. Cryogenic systems rely on differences in boiling points to separate and purify the desired products.

Oxygen stream enters mixed oxidizing fluid and or is mixed with oxidizing fluid . A portion of nitrogen stream may be recycled to air separation unit for use as a coolant. Nitrogen stream may be used as a drive fluid as a reactant to produce ammonia as a coolant for forming a low temperature barrier as a fluid used during drilling or as a fluid for other processes.

In some embodiments oxygen is produce through the decomposition of water. For example electrolysis of water produces oxygen and hydrogen. Using water as a source of oxygen provides a source of oxidant with minimal or no carbon dioxide emissions. The produced hydrogen may be used as a hydrogenation fluid for treating hydrocarbon fluids in situ or ex situ a fuel source and or for other purposes. depicts a schematic representation of an embodiment of a system for producing oxygen using electrolysis of water for use in an oxidizing fluid provided to burners that heat treatment area . As shown in water stream enters electrolysis unit . In electrolysis unit current is applied to water stream and produces oxygen stream and hydrogen stream . In some embodiments electrolysis of water stream is performed at temperatures ranging from about 600 C. to about 1000 C. from about 700 C. to about 950 C. or from 800 C. to about 900 C. In some embodiments electrolysis unit is powered by nuclear energy and or a solid oxide fuel cell. The use of nuclear energy and or a solid oxide fuel cell provides a heat source with minimal and or no carbon dioxide emissions. High temperature electrolysis may generate hydrogen and oxygen more efficiently than conventional electrolysis because energy losses resulting from the conversion of heat to electricity and electricity to heat are avoided by directly utilizing the heat produced from the nuclear reactions without producing electricity. Oxygen steam enters mixed oxidizing fluid and or is mixed with oxidizing fluid . A portion or all of hydrogen stream is recycled to electrolysis unit and used as an energy source. A portion or all of hydrogen stream may be used for other purposes such as but not limited to a fuel for burners and or a hydrogen source for in situ or ex situ hydrogenation of hydrocarbons.

In some embodiments on site production of hydrogen as a fuel for burners is desirable. The use of hydrogen as the fuel for burners may allow exhaust streams from the burners to be vented to the atmosphere with little or no treatment of the exhaust streams. Hydrogen may be produced by reformation of hydrocarbons by partial oxidation of hydrocarbons or by a combination of reformation and partial oxidation. Water gas shift reactions may be used after reformation and or partial oxidation of hydrocarbons to maximize hydrogen production. For example autothermal reformation of hydrocarbons having a carbon number of at most 5 produces hydrogen and carbon oxides. The produced hydrogen may be used as a hydrogenation fluid for treating hydrocarbon fluids in situ or ex situ a fuel source and or for other purposes.

Reformer unit may be for example an autothermal reformer and or a steam reformer. Reformer unit may include one or more catalysts that enhance the production of hydrogen and carbon dioxide from hydrocarbons. For example reformation unit may include water gas shift catalysts. Reformation unit may include one or more separation systems for example membranes and or a pressure swing adsorption system capable of separating hydrogen from other components. Reformation of fuel and or in situ heat treatment process gas may produce hydrogen stream and carbon oxide stream . Reformation of fuel and or in situ heat treatment process gas may be performed using techniques known in the art for catalytic and or thermal reformation of hydrocarbons to produce hydrogen. In some embodiments fuel and or in situ heat treatment process gas is passed through a drying system prior to entering reformation unit to remove water in the fuel and or gas.

Hydrogen stream may be provided to fuel conduit . A portion or all of hydrogen stream may be used for other purposes such as but not limited to an energy source and or a hydrogen source for in situ or ex situ hydrogenation of hydrocarbons. Valves may be adjusted to control the amount of initial fuel supplied to treatment area as fuel and or hydrogen stream become available.

Carbon oxide stream may include but is not limited to carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. Carbon oxide stream may be mixed with diluent fluid may be used as a carrier fluid for oxidizing fluid may be used as a drive fluid for producing hydrocarbons may be vented and or may be sequestered.

Combinations of processes described in may be used to produce fuel and or oxidizing fluid for burners that provide heat to heat treatment area .

Coke formation may occur inside the fuel conduit if the fuel contains hydrocarbons and the heat flux is sufficiently high. After oxidizer ignition steps may be taken to reduce coking. For example steam or water may be added to the fuel conduit. In some embodiments coking is inhibited by decreasing a residence time of fuel in the fuel conduit. The residence time of fuel in the fuel conduit may be decreased by varying the size of the fuel conduit. For example one portion of the fuel conduit may be approximately inch approximately 1.9 cm in diameter while another portion may be approximately inch approximately 0.95 cm in diameter. Alternatively the thickness and length of all or portions of the fuel conduit may be varied.

In some embodiments coking is inhibited by insulating portions of the fuel conduit that pass through high temperature zones proximate the oxidizers. For example a portion of the fuel conduit may be coated with an insulating layer and or a conductive layer. The insulating layer may be made from thermal insulating materials such as silicon carbide alumina mullite zirconia and other material known in the art. The conductive layer may be made from commercially available highly conductive materials such as ceramics and or high temperature metals including but not limited to Hexyloy available from Arklay S. Richards Co. Inc. . The insulating layer and or the conductive layer may be applied to the fuel conduit using a high velocity oxygen fuel or air plasma process. The resulting layer or layers may be heat treated.

In some embodiments the fuel conduit is treated to remove coke formed in the fuel conduit by decoking. Decoking may be performed through mechanical means and or chemical means. For example coke may be removed from the fuel conduit by pumping a metal studded foam or plastic pig through the fuel conduit. In an embodiment a rod is inserted into fuel conduit to dislodge coke particles and push them towards the last oxidizer in the oxidizer assembly. The rod may be a hydrolance or other high pressure pipe or tube used to direct high pressure water air nitrogen and or other gas to dislodge the coke.

Insulating layer may be placed around fuel conduit to at least partially surround a portion of the fuel conduit. Insulating layer may be made of a material with low thermal conductivity. Insulating layer may inhibit coking in fuel conduit . Insulating layer may only surround portions of fuel conduit that pass through oxidizers . In some embodiments the insulating layer covers the portion of the fuel conduit passing through the oxidizer and a portion of the fuel conduit before and or after the oxidizer. In some embodiments the entire fuel conduit is insulated.

Thermally conductive layer may surround or partially surround insulating layer . Thermally conductive layer may be located adjacent to flame zone . Thermally conductive layer may spread the heat of flame zone over a large area to help reduce the temperature applied to insulating layer below the flame zone. In some embodiments the insulating layer does not include a thermally conductive layer.

The flow of fuel in fuel conduit is represented by arrow and the flow of gas for example air and exhaust products and unburned fuel from previous oxidizers in oxidant conduit is represented by arrow . Exhaust gases from all oxidizers in the oxidizer assembly pass through outer conduit in the direction indicated by arrow . Flow of gas between fuel conduit and insulating sleeve may reduce the amount of heat transfer from the insulating sleeve to the fuel conduit. Flame zone may have a temperature of about 1100 C. about 2000 F. while the temperature in oxidant conduit adjacent to the shield of oxidizer may be about 700 C. about 1300 F. .

Oxidant may be supplied through the oxidant conduit to the oxidizers. Oxidizing fluid may include but is not limited to air oxygen enriched air and or hydrogen peroxide. Depletion of oxygen in the oxidant may occur toward a terminal end of an oxidizer assembly. In some embodiments the amount of excess oxidant supplied to the oxidizers is reduced to less than about 50 excess oxidant by weight by controlling the pressure temperature and flow rate of the oxidant in the oxidant conduit. For example after ignition the amount of oxidant can be reduced when the temperature of the fuel conduit reaches about 650 C. about 1200 F. . In some embodiments the amount of excess oxidant is reduced to less than about 25 excess oxidant by weight. In other embodiments the amount of excess oxidant is reduced to less than about 10 excess oxidant by weight.

In some embodiments the amount of excess oxidant is reduced when the temperature downstream of the oxidizers becomes sufficiently hot to support reaction of oxidant and fuel outside of the oxidizers. Oxidant and fuel may react in regions between oxidizers. During such operation the oxidizer assembly functions much like a flameless distributed combustor. Generating heat in the regions between the oxidizers may result in a smoother temperature profile along the length of the oxidizer assembly. The excess oxidant may be reduced such that the last oxidizer in the oxidizer assembly substantially eliminates the remaining oxidant in the oxidant conduit. The last oxidizer may be a catalytic oxidizer to minimize or eliminate oxidant remaining in the oxidant conduit.

When the temperature along the length of the oxidizer assembly increases to a temperature sufficient to support reaction of oxidant with fuel outside of the shields of the oxidizers the mode of operation of the oxidizer assembly may shift from a series of individual oxidizers with aerodynamically staged flames to a more uniformly distributed or reactor stable mode of operation. During the reactor stable mode of operation combustion may take place outside the shield along the entire length of the oxidant conduit. Under this condition stability is achieved by balancing overall heat loss and heat generation over the broad reaction zone. Local recirculation of hot combustion products to incoming reactants enables minimum reaction temperature where fuel oxidant mixtures will oxidize without aerodynamic stabilization. In this mode of operation the oxidizers may still serve as a safety or means of continuing stabilization if the temperature falls below the temperature needed to sustain oxidation of the fuel and oxidant in one or more regions of the oxidizer. During reactor stable mode of operation the amount of excess oxygen supplied to the oxidizer assembly may be reduced. Having the ability to reduce the amount of excess oxygen supplied to the oxidizer assembly may significantly improve the overall economics of the system used to heat the formation.

A common problem associated with the operation of gas burners employing a flame mechanism is that at high temperatures particularly above about 1500 C. about 2730 F. oxygen and nitrogen present in the air combine by a thermal formation mechanism to form pollutants such as NO and NO commonly referred to as NO. By controlling the flow of fuel and oxidant and by maintaining a distributed temperature the formation of NOmay be inhibited. In some embodiments the flow of fuel and oxidant is controlled to produce less than about 10 parts per million by weight of NOfrom the gas burner. The flow of oxidant may be controlled by having openings in shields of the oxidizers sized to bring a sufficient flow rate to the flame zone to dilute the flame without causing the flame to be extinguished. Additionally water added to the fuel conduit may inhibit NOformation.

In some embodiments initiation of the burner assembly is accomplished by initializing combustion in a specified sequence beginning with the last oxidizer in the assembly. Referring to oxidizer assembly includes first oxidizer last oxidizer and second to last oxidizer . In some embodiments fuel is supplied through fuel conduit and oxidant is supplied through oxidant conduit to provide a first combustible mixture to last oxidizer . Combustion is initiated in last oxidizer and the supply of oxidant is adjusted to supply second to last oxidizer with a second combustible mixture. Ignition of last oxidizer is maintained as second to last oxidizer is ignited. Thereafter this process of adjusting the supply of oxidant to provide a combustible fuel and oxidant mixture to the next unignited oxidizer and initiating combustion in the unignited oxidizer is repeated until first oxidizer is ignited. In some embodiments the fuel pressure is greater than the oxidant pressure at an oxidizer before initiating combustion in the oxidizer.

In an embodiment the start up sequence is optimized by controlling the oxidant and fuel pressure differential along the length of the oxidizer assembly. Because the pressure differential varies over the length of the burner assembly a planned sequential ignition from oxidizer to oxidizer starting with last most remote oxidizer may be achieved. In this embodiment the fuel oxidant mixture in the ignition region is optimized at last oxidizer then at the second to last oxidizer and so on with the fuel to oxidant ratio being least optimal at first oxidizer . The profiles may be controlled to change the sequence of ignition. In an embodiment the profiles may be reversed so that first oxidizer is ignited first. Altering the profiles may comprise altering the pressure differential along the oxidizer assembly length by design of the fuel conduit diameter coupled with optimization of opening sizes that provide fuel to the oxidizers of opening sizes that provide oxidant to the mix chambers of the oxidizers and of openings in the shields that supply oxidant to the flame zone. In addition control may be facilitated by flow restrictions positioned in fuel conduit .

In some embodiments flame stabilizers may be added to the oxidizers. The flame stabilizers may attach the flame to the shield. The high bypass flow around the oxidizer cools the shield and protects the internals of the oxidizer from damage enabling long term operation. depict various embodiments of shields with flame stabilizers . Flame stabilizer depicted in is a ring substantially perpendicular to shield . The ring shown in is angled away from openings . The rings may amount to up to about 25 annular area blockage. The rings may establish a recirculation zone near shield and away from the fuel conduit passing through the center of the shield.

In some embodiments deflectors may be positioned on the outer surface of the shield near to openings in the shield. The deflectors may direct some of the gas flowing through the oxidant conduit through the openings in the shield.

In one embodiment one or more of the oxidizers have flame stabilizers that utilize a louvered design to direct flow into the shield. depicts oxidizer with louvered openings in shield . Louvered openings are in communication with the oxidant conduit. An extension on the inside wall of shield directs gas flow into shield in a direction opposite to the direction of flow in the oxidant conduit. depicts a cross sectional representation of a portion of shield with louvered opening . Gas with oxidant entering shield may be directed by extension in a desired direction. Arrow indicates the direction of gas flow from the oxidant conduit to the inside of shield. Arrow indicates the direction of gas flow in the oxidant conduit.

As depicted in shield may include opening . The size and or number of openings may be varied depending on position of the oxidizer in the oxidizer assembly to moderate the temperature and ensure fuel combustion. In some embodiments the geometry and size of openings on a single oxidizer may be varied to compensate for changing conditions and needs along the length of the oxidizer.

In some embodiments one or more of the openings in the shield may be angled in a non perpendicular direction relative to the longitudinal axis of the shield. Angled openings act as nozzles to alter the entry path of gas into the shield. Angled openings may promote formation of internal low velocity recirculation zones where the reaction front can stabilize and improve the stability and reliability of the oxidizer.

The use of flame stabilizers various sizes of openings in the shield and or angled openings may establish the flame zone of the oxidizer close to the shield and as far away from the fuel conduit to maximize radial separation of the flame zone from the fuel conduit to minimize direct heating of the fuel conduit by the flame zone. The use of flame stabilizers various sizes of openings in the shield and or angled openings may also achieve lower NOemissions by effectively aerodynamically staging the combustion zone and creating fuel rich and lean zones. In fuel rich zones Nformation instead of NO will be favored and aerodynamic staging will control peak temperatures and thermal NOformation. Such configurations can also enable control of the peak longitudinal temperature profile and flame radiation thus suppressing overheating of the fuel conduit.

In some embodiments fuel passes through a heated region before being supplied to the first oxidizer oxidizer in . Passing the fuel through the heated region may preheat the fuel and ensure that the fuel and additives in the fuel for example water to inhibit coking are in the gas phase. Ensuring gas phase fuel may avoid plugging in first oxidizer . depicts an embodiment of first oxidizer and fuel conduit . Fuel conduit may include sleeve . Fuel may flow through sleeve and a portion of the fuel may flow in the opposite direction in the annular space between the sleeve and fuel conduit . A portion of the fuel flowing in the annular space between sleeve and fuel conduit passes through openings into mix chamber .

In some embodiments a portion of the fuel flowing in the annular space between sleeve and fuel conduit passes through openings into the annular space between the fuel conduit and shield . Supplying fuel into this annular space may allow flame zone to extend through a significant portion of first oxidizer so that the first oxidizer is able to input more heat into the formation. First oxidizer may be configured to input more heat into the formation to help compensate for heat losses attributable to the oxidizer being the first oxidizer of the oxidizer assembly. Having first oxidizer configured to input more heat into the formation than other oxidizers of the oxidizer assembly may allow for a decrease in the total number of oxidizers needed in the downhole assembly.

One or more of the oxidizers in an oxidizer assembly may be a catalytic burner. The catalytic burners may include a catalytic portion for example a catalyst chamber followed by a homogenous portion for example an ignition chamber . Catalytic burners may be started late in an ignition sequence and may ignite without igniters. Oxidant for the catalytic burners may be sufficiently hot from upstream burners for example the oxidant may be at a temperature of about 370 F. about 700 C. if the fuel is primarily methane so that a primary mixture would react over the catalyst in the catalyst portion and produce enough heat so that exiting products ignite a secondary mixture in the homogenous portion of the oxidizer. In some embodiments the fuel may include enough hydrogen to allow the needed temperature of the oxidant to be lower. Catalysts used for this purpose may include palladium platinum platinum iridium platinum rhodium or mixtures thereof.

In some embodiments a catalytic burner may include an igniter to simplify startup procedures. depicts catalytic burner that includes igniter . Igniter is positioned in mix chamber . Catalytic burner includes catalyst chamber . Catalyst chamber contains a catalyst that reacts a mixture from mix chamber to produce reaction products at a temperature that is sufficient to ignite fuel and oxidant. Oxidant enters mix chamber through openings A. Fuel enters the mix chamber from fuel line through fuel openings A. The fuel input into mixture chamber may be only a small fraction of the fuel input for catalytic burner . Igniter raises the temperature of the fuel and oxidant to combustion temperatures in pre heat zone . Flame stabilizer may be positioned in mixing chamber . Heat from pre heat zone and or combustion products may heat additional fuel that enters mixing chamber through fuel openings B and additional oxidant that enters the mixing chamber through openings B. Openings B and openings B may be upstream of flame stabilizer . The additional fuel and oxidant are heated to a temperature sufficient to support reaction on catalyst .

Heated fuel and oxidant from mixing chamber pass to catalyst . The fuel and oxidant react on catalyst to form hot reaction products. The hot reaction products may be directed to heat shield . Additional fuel enters heat shield through openings C in fuel conduit . Additional oxidant enters heat shield through openings . The hot reaction products generated by catalyst may ignite fuel and oxidant in autoignition zone . Autoignition zone may allow fuel and oxidant to form main combustion zone . In some embodiments the catalytic burner includes flame stabilizers or other types of gas flow modifiers.

In some embodiments all of the oxidizers in the oxidizer assembly are catalytic burners. In some embodiments the first or the first several oxidizers in the oxidizer assembly are catalytic burners. The oxidant supplied to these burners may be at a lower temperature than subsequent burners. Using catalytic burners with igniters may stabilize the initial performance of the first several oxidizers in the oxidizer assembly. Catalytic burners may be used in line with other burners to reduce emissions by allowing lower flame temperatures while still having substantially complete combustion.

In some embodiments a catalytic converter may be positioned at the end of the oxidizer assembly or in the exhaust gas return. The catalytic converter may remove unburned hydrocarbons and or remaining NOcompounds or other pollutants. The catalytic converter may benefit from the relatively high temperature of the exhaust gas. In some embodiments catalytic burners in series may be integrated with coupled catalytic converters to limit undesired emissions from the oxidizer assembly. In some embodiments a selectively permeable material may be used to allow carbon dioxide or other fluids to be separated from the exhaust gas.

In one embodiment initiation of the burner assembly may be accomplished by initializing combustion with hydrogen and later switching to natural gas or another fuel. The use of hydrogen enriched fuel may suppress flame radiation and reduce heating of the fuel conduit. Oxidizers of the oxidizer assembly may be ignited using hydrogen or fuel that is highly enriched with hydrogen. Once ignited the composition of fuel may be adjusted to comprise natural gas and or other fuels. The initial use of hydrogen or hydrogen enriched fuel widens the flammability envelope enabling much easier startup. An initial fuel composition could then be chased with production gas or other more economical gases. Alternatively the entire system could burn hydrogen. With no carbon in the fuel there would be no need for additional decoking methods.

Oxidant conduit is positioned in outer conduit . Fuel conduits are positioned in the space between oxidant conduit and outer conduit . In the depicted embodiment four fuel conduits are shown. More than four fuel conduits or less than four fuel conduits may be positioned in the oxidizer assembly in other embodiments. Fuel taps may pass from fuel conduits through oxidant conduit to a mix chamber of an oxidizer. In some embodiments each fuel conduit supplies a single oxidizer. In some embodiments one fuel conduit supplies two or more oxidizers of the oxidizer assembly. Portions or all of fuel conduits and or portions or all of fuel taps may be insulated. In some embodiments fuel conduits are positioned radially away from oxidant conduit so that exhaust gas returning through the space between outer conduit and the oxidant conduit transfers heat with the fuel conduits to limit the upper temperature attained by the fuel conduits.

Using multiple fuel conduits may allow the supply of fuel to be interrupted to one or more of oxidizers without adversely affecting all of the oxidizers. Multiple fuel conduits also allow for adjustment of fuel mixtures supplied to the oxidizers during startup and after steady operation of the oxidizers is established.

Igniter supply conduits may be positioned in the space between oxidant conduit and outer conduit . In some embodiments the igniter supply conduits are positioned in the oxidant conduit. Igniters may branch from igniter supply conduits into ignition chamber of the oxidizers. In the depicted embodiment four igniter supply conduits are shown. More than four igniter supply conduits or less than four igniter supply conduits may be positioned in the oxidizer assembly in other embodiments. Igniter supply conduits may be conduits that convey a fuel for example hydrogen to a catalyst in the igniter. Igniter supply conduits may hold insulated conductors that provide electricity to the igniters. The igniters may be glow plugs spark plugs or other types of igniters that use electricity to ignite the oxidizers. In some embodiments the igniter supply conduit is an insulated conductor. In some embodiments some igniter supply conduits may convey fuel and other igniter supply conduits of the oxidizer assembly may transmit electricity.

A mixture of fuel and oxidant passes from mix chamber to ignition chamber through mixture opening . Mixture opening may be positioned along a central axis of oxidizer as depicted in and . Positioning mixture opening allows flame zone generated by ignited fuel mixture to be substantially axisymmetric within oxidizer . Flame zone may be stable and result in the production of low amount of NOcompounds. Flame zone may have the potential for swirl applications.

In some embodiments igniter branches from igniter supply conduit through oxidant conduit into ignition chamber . Igniter may be used during start up of the oxidizer assembly to initiate combustion of fuel and oxidant mixture passing through opening . In some embodiments use of the igniters is stopped after start up of the oxidizers in the oxidizer assembly. Flame zone generated by combusting the oxidant and fuel mixture may extend through ignition chamber into shield . Shield may stabilize flame zone and inhibit blow out of the flame zone by oxidant and exhaust gas flowing through oxidant conduit .

In some embodiments one or more small oxidant conduit lines may be positioned in the oxidizer assembly to provide additional oxidizing fluid to the oxidizers located near the end of the oxidizer assembly. Small oxidant lines may be positioned in the main oxidant conduit and or in the space between the oxidant conduit and the outer conduit. Additional oxidizing fluid may be introduced into the exhaust and oxidizing fluid flowing through the main oxidant conduit. The additional oxidizing fluid may result in combustion of all of the fuel supplied to the oxidizers.

In some embodiments oxidizers that produce a flame are used as preheaters upstream of flameless distributed combustors. The oxidizers preheat the oxidizing fluid and or the fuel supplied to the flameless distributed combustors above a temperature of about 815 C. which is above the auto ignition temperature of a mixture of oxidant fluid and fuel.

The flameless distributed combustor segments may be 100 ft to 500 ft in length. Shorter or longer flameless distributed combustor segment lengths may also be used.

Orifices allow heated fuel to mix with heated oxidizing fluid so that the mixture reacts to produce additional heat. Flameless distributed combustors may operate at much lower temperature than oxidizers since no flame is present. The lower temperature may result in the production of less NOcompounds if the oxidizing fluid includes or the fuel includes nitrogen or nitrogen compounds.

In some embodiments one or more additional fuel conduits may be positioned in the space between the oxidant conduit and the outer conduit. Taps from the additional fuel conduits may pass through the oxidant conduit to provide fuel to the oxidizers and or to the central fuel conduit prior to one of the oxidizers.

An oxidant may be mixed with the pulverized coal at several locations in the wellbore. The oxidant may be air oxygen enriched air and or other types of oxidizing fluids. Igniters located at or near the mixing locations initiate oxidation of the coal and oxidant. The igniters may be catalytic igniters glow plugs spark plugs and or electrical heaters for example an insulated conductor temperature limited heater with heating sections located at mixing locations of pulverized coal and oxidant that are able to initiate oxidation of the oxidant with the pulverized coal.

The particles of the pulverized coal may be small enough to pass through flow orifices and achieve rapid combustion in the oxidant. The pulverized coal may have a particle size distribution from about 1 micron to about 300 microns from about 5 microns to about 150 microns or from about 10 microns to about 100 microns. Other pulverized coal particle size distributions may also be used. At 600 C. the time to burn the volatiles in pulverized coal with a particle size distribution from about 10 microns to about 100 microns may be about one second.

Exhaust gas from oxidizer assemblies depicted in and may be treated to remove unreacted coal ash fines and or other particles in the exhaust gas. In some embodiments exhaust gas passes through one or more cyclones to remove particles from the exhaust gas. Exhaust gas may be further processed to remove selected compounds for example sulfur and or nitrogen compounds may be used as a drive fluid for mobilizing hydrocarbons in a formation may be sequestered in a subsurface formation and or may be otherwise handled.

In some embodiments one or more of combustion units used to heat the formation are fluidized combustors. A portion of the fluidized material from the fluidized bed reactor flows into supply conduit and from the supply conduit to inlet legs of u shaped wellbores in the formation. In some embodiments one or more of combustion units used to heat the formation are furnaces nuclear reactors or other high temperature heat sources.

Oxidant may be supplied to combustion unit through oxidant line . Fuel may be supplied to combustion unit through fuel line . Exhaust gases may be removed from combustion unit through exhaust line . The oxidant line fuel line and exhaust line may not be needed if the combustion unit is a nuclear reactor. If combustion unit is a fluidized bed combustor fuel line may spray fuel oil or other fuel into the fluidized combustor in addition to the fuel sent to the combustion unit contained in the fluidized material in conduit . Fluidized material exiting combustion unit may be at a high temperature. For example the fluidized material may be at temperatures from about 300 C. to about 1000 C. from about 500 C. to about 800 C. or from about 700 C. to about 750 C.

The u shaped conduits in the formation may have a relatively small diameter. For example the diameter of the u shaped conduits in the formation may be less than 8 cm. Heat transfers substantially by radiation and or conduction from the u shaped conduits to the formation. Inlet legs and or outlet legs may be insulated through the overburden to inhibit heat transfer to the overburden. In some embodiments the direction of flow in the u shaped conduits is reversed periodically to promote more uniform heating of the formation from the conduits. For example the flow may be reversed every six months. Other time periods before reversing the flow may be used. In some embodiments the direction of fluidized material flow in one u shaped conduit is opposite in direction to the flow of fluidized material in an adjacent u shaped conduit.

The inner surfaces of the u shaped conduits may include inserts baffles and or roughened surfaces. The inserts may be liners that are periodically replaced in the conduits. The inserts baffles and or roughened surfaces may increase turbulence of the fluidized material in the conduits to increase heat transfer to the conduits. Fluidized material flowing through the u shaped conduits may impact on the inserts baffles and or roughened surfaces. The impacts may transfer heat kinetically to the conduits. In some embodiments portions of the outside surfaces of the conduits may include roughening and or protrusions to increase heat transfer from the conduits to the formation.

Fluidized material exiting the formation may pass from the u shaped conduits into return conduits line . Return conduit may direct the fluidized material to treatment unit . Treatment unit may include cyclones and or other separation units that separate fines and exhaust gas from fluidized material that may be recirculated through fast fluidized transport system . In some embodiments fluidized material that is to be recirculated is coated with bitumen or other hydrocarbons in treatment unit before being sent to combustion unit .

Replenishment line may supply fresh fluidized material to line returning to combustion unit . The fresh fluidized material may compensate for fines and exhaust gas removed in treatment unit .

Fluidized material in line may include coal particles for example pulverized coal other hydrocarbon or carbon containing material for example bitumen and coke and heat carrier particles. The heat carrier particles may include but are not limited to sand silica ceramic particles waste fluidized catalytic cracking catalyst other particles used for heat transfer or mixtures thereof. In some embodiments the particle range distribution of the fluidized material may span from between about 5 and 200 microns.

Fluidized material may still have a significant carbon coke and or hydrocarbon content after passing through combustion unit . Inlet legs of the u shaped conduits in the formation may be supplied with oxidant for example air through oxidant supply lines . The oxidant may react with the carbon and or hydrocarbons in the fluidized material in the u shaped conduits. In some embodiments the temperature of the oxidant in oxidant supply line is raised by passing through combustion unit or otherwise raising the temperature of the oxidant prior to introducing the oxidant into the u shaped conduits. Introducing heated oxidant into the u shaped conduits may promote oxidation of hydrocarbons and carbon in the fluidized material. The combustion of hydrocarbons and carbon in the fluidized material may maintain a high temperature of the fluidized material and or generate heat that transfers to the formation. In some embodiments oxidant from oxidant supply line is supplied to outer conduits that surround portions of inlet legs .

The fuel may be ground or otherwise sized so that the size of the chunks pellets or granules provides a large surface area that facilities combustion of the fuel. A u shaped wellbore may be formed in the formation. In some embodiments the fuel is burned as the fuel is transported on a grate through the formation. In some embodiments the fuel is burned in a batch or semi batch operation. Fuel is placed on a train and the train is moved to a location in the formation. The fuel is combusted and then the train is pulled out of the formation and another train is placed in the formation with fresh fuel. Heat from the burning fuel may heat the formation. Enough fuel may be placed on the grates so that all of the fuel is combusted before the grate is removed from the wellbore.

Coal and or biomass may be significantly less expensive than other energy sources for heating the formation for example electricity and or gas . Combusting coal in the formation may improve energy efficiency and lower cost as compared with using the coal to produce electricity that in turn is used to heat the formation.

In some embodiments a removable electric heater or combustor is used to initiate combustion of the fuel. The electric heater and or combustor may be inserted in the formation beneath the overburden. The electric heater and or combustor may be used to raise the temperature near the interface between the overburden and the treatment area above an auto ignition temperature of the fuel on the grate. The fuel on the grate may begin to combust as the fuel passes through the heated zone. Heat from combusting fuel heats the treatment area. When the treatment area adjacent to the entrance to the treatment area rises above the auto ignition temperature of the fuel use of the electric heater and or combustor may be stopped. In some embodiments the electric heater and or combustor are removed from the wellbores.

Carriers may include grates and ash catchers . Fuel may be positioned on top of grates . Fuel placed on grate of carrier may be pulverized ground or otherwise sized so that the average particle size of the fuel is larger than the size of openings through the grates. When fuel burns ash may fall through the openings in grates to fall on ash catchers . Oxidant conduit and heater may pass through ash catchers .

Oxidant conduit may carry an oxidant such as air enriched air or oxygen and a carrier fluid for example carbon dioxide to fuel . Oxidant conduit may include a number of openings that allow the oxidant to be introduced into the formation along the length of the U shaped wellbore that is to be heated. In some embodiments the openings are critical flow orifices. In some embodiments more than one oxidant conduit is placed in the U shaped wellbore. In some embodiments one or more oxidant conduits enter the formation from each side of the U shaped wellbore.

Conveyor may pull train through the U shaped wellbore. In some embodiments conveyor is a belt cable and or chain. In some embodiments fuel is transported pneumatically through the wellbore. Canisters with openings are loaded with fuel. Openings in the canisters allow oxidant in and exhaust products out of the canisters. The canisters may be pneumatically drawn through the wellbore.

In some in situ heat treatment process embodiments a circulation system is used to heat the formation. The circulation system may be a closed loop circulation system. depicts a schematic representation of a system for heating a formation using a circulation system. The system may be used to heat hydrocarbons that are relatively deep in the ground and that are in formations that are relatively large in extent. In some embodiments the hydrocarbons may be 100 m 200 m 300 m or more below the surface. The circulation system may also be used to heat hydrocarbons that are not as deep in the ground. The hydrocarbons may be in formations that extend lengthwise up to 500 m 750 m 1000 m or more. The circulation system may become economically viable in formations where the length of the hydrocarbon containing formation to be treated is long compared to the thickness of the overburden. The ratio of the hydrocarbon formation extent to be heated by heaters to the overburden thickness may be at least 3 at least 5 or at least 10. The heaters of the circulation system may be positioned relative to adjacent heaters so that superposition of heat between heaters of the circulation system allows the temperature of the formation to be raised at least above the boiling point of aqueous formation fluid in the formation.

In some embodiments heaters may be formed in the formation by drilling a first wellbore and then drilling a second wellbore that connects with the first wellbore. Piping may be positioned in the U shaped wellbore to form U shaped heater . Heaters are connected to heat transfer fluid circulation system by piping. Gas at high pressure may be used as the heat transfer fluid in the closed loop circulation system. In some embodiments the heat transfer fluid is carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is chemically stable at the required temperatures and pressures and has a relatively high molecular weight that results in a high volumetric heat capacity. Other fluids such as steam air helium and or nitrogen may also be used. The pressure of the heat transfer fluid entering the formation may be 3000 kPa or higher. The use of high pressure heat transfer fluid allows the heat transfer fluid to have a greater density and therefore a greater capacity to transfer heat. Also the pressure drop across the heaters is less for a system where the heat transfer fluid enters the heaters at a first pressure for a given mass flow rate than when the heat transfer fluid enters the heaters at a second pressure at the same mass flow rate when the first pressure is greater than the second pressure.

In some embodiments a liquid heat transfer fluid is used as the heat transfer file. The liquid heat transfer fluid may be a natural or synthetic oil molten metal molten salt or other type of high temperature heat transfer fluid. A liquid heat transfer fluid may allow for smaller diameter piping and reduced pumping compression costs. In some embodiments the piping is made of a material resistant to corrosion by the liquid heat transfer fluid. In some embodiments the piping is lined with a material that is resistant to corrosion by the liquid heat transfer fluid. For example if the heat transfer fluid is a molten fluoride salt the piping may include a 10 mil thick nickel liner. The piping may be formed by roll bonding a nickel strip onto a strip of the piping material for example stainless steel rolling the composite strip and longitudinally welding the composite strip to form the piping. Other techniques may also be used. Corrosion of nickel by the molten fluoride salt may be less than 1 mil per year at a temperature of about 840 C.

Heat transfer fluid circulation system may include heat supply first heat exchanger second heat exchanger and compressor . Heat supply heats the heat transfer fluid to a high temperature. Heat supply may be a furnace solar collector chemical reactor nuclear reactor fuel cell and or other high temperature source able to supply heat to the heat transfer fluid. In the embodiment depicted in heat supply is a furnace that heats the heat transfer fluid to a temperature in a range from about 700 C. to about 920 C. from about 770 C. to about 870 C. or from about 800 C. to about 850 C. In an embodiment heat supply heats the heat transfer fluid to a temperature of about 820 C. The heat transfer fluid flows from heat supply to heaters . Heat transfers from heaters to formation adjacent to the heaters. The temperature of the heat transfer fluid exiting formation may be in a range from about 350 C. to about 580 C. from about 400 C. to about 530 C. or from about 450 C. to about 500 C. In an embodiment the temperature of the heat transfer fluid exiting formation is about 480 C. The metallurgy of the piping used to form heat transfer fluid circulation system may be varied to significantly reduce costs of the piping. High temperature steel may be used from heat supply to a point where the temperature is sufficiently low so that less expensive steel can be used from that point to first heat exchanger . Several different steel grades may be used to form the piping of heat transfer fluid circulation system .

Heat transfer fluid from heat supply of heat transfer fluid circulation system passes through overburden of formation to hydrocarbon layer . Portions of heaters extending through overburden may be insulated. In some embodiments the insulation or part of the insulation is a polyimide insulating material. Inlet portions of heaters in hydrocarbon layer may have tapering insulation to reduce overheating of the hydrocarbon layer near the inlet of the heater into the hydrocarbon layer.

In some embodiments the diameter of the pipe in overburden may be smaller than the diameter of pipe through hydrocarbon layer . The smaller diameter pipe through overburden may allow for less heat transfer to the overburden. Reducing the amount of heat transfer to overburden reduces the amount of cooling of the heat transfer fluid supplied to pipe adjacent to hydrocarbon layer . The increased heat transfer in the smaller diameter pipe due to increased velocity of heat transfer fluid through the small diameter pipe is offset by the smaller surface area of the smaller diameter pipe and the decrease in residence time of the heat transfer fluid in the smaller diameter pipe.

After exiting formation the heat transfer fluid passes through first heat exchanger and second heat exchanger to compressor . First heat exchanger transfers heat between heat transfer fluid exiting formation and heat transfer fluid exiting compressor to raise the temperature of the heat transfer fluid that enters heat supply and reduce the temperature of the fluid exiting formation . Second heat exchanger further reduces the temperature of the heat transfer fluid before the heat transfer fluid enters compressor .

In some embodiments a liquid heat transfer fluid may be used instead of a gas heat transfer fluid. The compressor banks represented by compressor in may be replaced by pumps or other liquid moving devices.

In some embodiments piping for the circulation system may allow the direction of heat transfer fluid flow through the formation to be changed. Changing the direction of heat transfer fluid flow through the formation allows each end of a u shaped wellbore to initially receive the heat transfer fluid at the hottest temperature of the heat transfer fluid for a period of time which may result in more uniform heating of the formation. The direction of heat transfer fluid may be changed at desired time intervals. The desired time interval may be about a year about six months about three months about two months or any other desired time interval.

In some embodiments the circulation system may be used in conjunction with electrical heating. In some embodiments at least a portion of the pipe in the U shaped wellbores adjacent to portions of the formation that are to be heated is made of a ferromagnetic material. For example the piping adjacent to a layer or layers of the formation to be heated is made of 9 to 13 chromium steel such as 410 stainless steel. The pipe may be a temperature limited heater when time varying electric current is applied to the piping. The time varying electric current may resistively heat the piping which heats the formation and the material in the piping. In some embodiments direct electric current may be used to resistively heat the pipe which heats the formation. In some embodiments the material used to form the pipe in the U shaped wellbore does not include ferromagnetic material. Direct or time varying current may be used to resistively heat the pipe which heats the formation.

In some embodiments one or more insulated conductors are placed in the piping. Electrical current may be supplied to the insulated conductors to resistively heat at least a portion of the insulated conductors. Heated insulated conductors may provide heat to the contents of the piping and the piping. The piping heated by the insulated conductor may heat adjacent formation. depicts insulated conductor positioned in heater . Heater is piping of the circulation system positioned in the formation. In some embodiments one or more insulated conductors may be strapped to the piping.

In some embodiments the circulation system is used to heat the formation to a first temperature and electrical energy is used to maintain the temperature of the formation and or heat the formation to higher temperatures. The first temperature may be sufficient to vaporize aqueous formation fluid in the formation. The first temperature may be at most about 200 C. at most about 300 C. at most about 350 C. or at most about 400 C. Using the circulation system to heat the formation to the first temperature allows the formation to be dry when electricity is used to heat the formation. Heating the dry formation may minimize electrical current leakage into the formation.

In some embodiments the circulation system and electrical heating may be used to heat the formation to a first temperature. The formation may be maintained or the temperature of the formation may be increased from the first temperature using the circulation system and or electrical heating. In some embodiments the formation may be raised to the first temperature using electrical heating and the temperature may be maintained and or increased using the circulation system. Economic factors available electricity availability of fuel for heating the heat transfer fluid and other factors may be used to determine when electrical heating and or circulation system heating are to be used.

In some embodiments electrical heating is used to raise the temperature of the piping to a desired temperature. The desired temperature may be a temperature higher than a temperature needed to maintain the heat transfer fluid for example a molten metal or a molten salt in a liquid phase. The electrical heating may inhibit plugging of the piping and allow the heat transfer to flow through the piping.

In certain embodiments the portions of heater in overburden are used as lead in conductors. The portions of heater in overburden may be electrically coupled to the portion of heater in hydrocarbon layer . In some embodiments one or more electrically conducting materials such as copper or aluminum are coupled for example cladded or welded to the portions of heater in overburden to reduce the electrical resistance of the portions of the heater in the overburden. Reducing the electrical resistance of the portions of heater in overburden reduces heat losses in the overburden during electrical heating.

In some embodiments the portion of heater in hydrocarbon layer is a temperature limited heater with a self limiting temperature between about 600 C. and about 1000 C. The portion of heater in hydrocarbon layer may be a 9 to 13 chromium stainless steel. For example portion of heater in hydrocarbon layer may be 410 stainless steel. Time varying current may be applied to the portion of heater in hydrocarbon layer so that the heater operates as a temperature limited heater.

Electrical power supply system may include transformer and cables . In certain embodiments cables are capable of carrying high currents with low losses. For example cables may be thick copper or aluminum conductors. The cables may also have thick insulation layers. In some embodiments cable and or cable may be superconducting cables. The superconducting cables may be cooled by liquid nitrogen. Superconducting cables are available from Superpower Inc. Schenectady N.Y. U.S.A. .

Separator may receive heat transfer fluid and lifting gas from a piping manifold that transports the heat transfer fluid and lifting gas from the individual heater legs in the formation. Separator separates the lift gas from the heat transfer fluid. The heat transfer fluid is sent to vessel .

Conduits from sumps to separator may include one or more insulated conductors or other types of heaters. The insulated conductors or other types of heaters may be placed in conduits and or be strapped or otherwise coupled to the outside of the conduits. The heaters may inhibit solidification of the heat transfer fluid in conduits during the gas lift from sump .

Circulation systems may be used to heat portions of the formation. Production wells in the formation are used to remove produced fluids. After production from the formation has ended the circulation system may be used to recover heat from the formation. depicts an embodiment of a circulation system. Heat transfer fluid may be circulated through heaters after heat supply is disconnected from the circulation system. The heat transfer fluid may be a different heat transfer fluid than the heat transfer fluid used to heat the formation. Heat transfers from the heated formation to the heat transfer fluid. The heat transfer fluid may be used to heat another portion of the formation or the heat transfer fluid may be used for other purposes. In some embodiments water is introduced into heaters to produce steam. In some embodiments low temperature steam is introduced into heaters so that the passage of the steam through the heaters increases the temperature of the steam. Other heat transfer fluids including natural or synthetic oils such as Syltherm oil Dow Corning Corporation Midland Mich. U.S.A. may be used instead of steam or water.

In some embodiments nuclear energy may be used to heat the heat transfer fluid used in the circulation system to heat a portion of the formation. Heat supply in may be a pebble bed reactor or other type of nuclear reactor such as a light water reactor. The use of nuclear energy provides a heat source with little or no carbon dioxide emissions. Also the use of nuclear energy can be more efficient because energy losses resulting from the conversion of heat to electricity and electricity to heat are avoided by directly utilizing the heat produced from the nuclear reactions without producing electricity.

In some embodiments a nuclear reactor may heat helium. For example helium flows through a pebble bed reactor and heat transfers to the helium. The helium may be used as the heat transfer fluid to heat the formation.

Helium from heat exchanger units is sent to additional heat exchanger units to transfer heat to the heat transfer fluid. The heat transfer fluid is taken through a power cycle such as a Kalina cycle to generate electricity. In an embodiment nuclear reactor is a 400 MW reactor and auxiliary power unit generates about 30 MW of electricity.

In some in situ heat treatment embodiments compressors provide compressed gases to the treatment area. For example compressors may be used to provide oxidizing fluid and or fuel to a plurality of oxidizer assemblies like oxidizer assembly depicted in . Each oxidizer assembly may include a number of oxidizers . Oxidizers may burn a mixture of oxidizing fluid and fuel to produce heat that heats the treatment area in the formation. Also compressors may be used to supply gas phase heat transfer fluid to the formation as depicted in . In some embodiments pumps provide liquid phase heat transfer fluid to the treatment area.

A significant cost of the in situ heat treatment process may be operating the compressors and or pumps over the life of the in situ heat treatment process if conventional electrical energy sources are used to power the compressors and or pumps of the in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments nuclear power may be used to generate electricity that operates the compressors and or pumps needed for the in situ heat treatment process. The nuclear power may be supplied by one or more nuclear reactors. The nuclear reactors may be light water reactors pebble bed reactors and or other types of nuclear reactors. The nuclear reactors may be located at or near to the in situ heat treatment process site. Locating the nuclear reactors at or near to the in situ heat treatment process site may reduce equipment costs and electrical transmission losses over long distances. The use of nuclear power may reduce or eliminate the amount of carbon dioxide generation associated with operating the compressors and or pumps over the life of the in situ heat treatment process.

Excess electricity generated by the nuclear reactors may be used for other in situ heat treatment process needs. For example excess electricity may be used to cool fluid for forming a low temperature barrier frozen barrier around treatment areas and or for providing electricity to treatment facilities located at or near the in situ heat treatment process site. In some embodiments the electricity or excess electricity produced by the nuclear reactors may be used to resistively heat the conduits used to circulate heat transfer fluid through the treatment area.

In some embodiments excess heat available from the nuclear reactors may be used for other in situ processes. For example excess heat may be used to heat water or make steam that is used in solution mining processes. In some embodiments excess heat from the nuclear reactors may be used to heat fluids used in the treatment facilities located near or at the in situ heat treatment site.

In some embodiments geothermal energy may be used to heat or preheat a treatment area of an in situ heat treatment process or a treatment area to be solution mined. Geothermal energy may have little or no carbon dioxide emissions. In some embodiments geothermally heated fluid may be produced from a layer or layers located below or near the treatment area. The geothermally heated fluid includes but is not limited to steam water and or brine. One or more of the layers may be geothermally pressurized geysers. Geothermally heated fluid may be pumped from one or more of the layers. The layer or layers may be at least 2 km at least 4 km at least 8 km or more below the surface. The geothermally heated fluid may be at a temperature of at least 100 C. at least 200 C. or at least 300 C.

The geothermally heated fluid may be produced and circulated through piping in the treatment area to raise the temperature of the treatment area. In some embodiments the geothermally heated fluid is introduced directly into the treatment area. In some embodiments the geothermally heated fluid is circulated through the treatment area or piping in the treatment area without being produced to the surface and re introduced into the treatment area. In some embodiments the geothermally heated fluid may be produced from a location near the treatment area. The geothermally heated fluid may be transported to the treatment area. Once transported to the treatment area the geothermally heated fluid is circulated through piping in the treatment area and or the geothermally heated fluid is introduced directly into the treatment area.

In some embodiments geothermally heated fluid produced from a layer or layers is used to solution mine minerals from the formation. The geothermally heated fluid may be used to raise the temperature of the formation to a temperature below the dissociation temperature of the minerals but to a temperature high enough to increase the amount of mineral going into solution in a first fluid introduced into the formation. The geothermally heated fluid may be introduced directly into the formation as all or a portion of the first fluid and or the geothermally heated fluid may be circulated through piping in the formation.

In some embodiments geothermally heated fluid produced from a layer or layers may be used to heat the treatment area before using electrical heaters gas burners or other types of heat sources to heat the treatment area to pyrolysis temperatures. The geothermally heated fluid may not be at a temperature sufficient to raise the temperature of the treatment area to pyrolysis temperatures. Using the geothermally heated fluid to heat the treatment area before using electrical heaters or other heat sources to heat the treatment area to pyrolysis temperatures may reduce energy costs for the in situ heat treatment process.

In some embodiments hot dry rock technology may be used to produce steam or other hot heat transfer fluid from a deep portion of the formation. Injection wells may be drilled to a depth where the formation is hot. The injection wells may be at least 2 km at least 4 km or at least 8 km deep. Sections of the formation adjacent to the bottom portions of the injection wells may be hydraulically or otherwise fractured to provide large contact area with the formation and or to provide flow paths to heated fluid production wells. Water steam and or other heat transfer fluid for example a synthetic oil or a natural oil may be introduced into the formation through the injection wells. Heat transfers to the introduced fluid from the formation. Steam and or hot heat transfer fluid may be produced from the heated fluid production wells. In some embodiments the steam and or hot heat transfer fluid is directed into the treatment area from the production wells without first producing the steam and or hot heat transfer fluid to the surface. The steam and or hot heat transfer fluid may be used to heat a portion of a hydrocarbon containing formation above the deep hot portion of the formation.

In some embodiments steam produced from heated fluid production wells may be used as the steam for a drive process for example a steam flood process or a steam assisted gravity drainage process . In some embodiments steam or other hot heat transfer fluid produced through heated fluid production wells is passed through U shaped wellbores or other types of wellbores to provide initial heating to the formation. In some embodiments cooled steam or water or cooled heat transfer fluid resulting from the use of the steam and or heat transfer fluid from the hot portion of the formation may be collected and sent to the hot portion of the formation to be reheated.

In certain embodiments a controlled or staged in situ heating and production process is used to in situ heat treat a hydrocarbon containing formation for example an oil shale formation . The staged in situ heating and production process may use less energy input to produce hydrocarbons from the formation than a continuous or batch in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments the staged in situ heating and production process is about 30 more efficient in treating the formation than the continuous or batch in situ heat treatment process. The staged in situ heating and production process may also produce less carbon dioxide emissions than a continuous or batch in situ heat treatment process. In certain embodiments the staged in situ heating and production process is used to treat rich layers in the oil shale formation. Treating only the rich layers may be more economical than treating both rich layers and lean layers because heat may be wasted heating the lean layers.

In certain embodiments heaters in one of the sections are turned on while the heaters in other sections remain turned off. For example heaters in section may be turned on while the heaters in the other sections are left turned off. Heat from heaters in section may create permeability mobilize fluids and or pyrolysis fluids in section . While heat is being provided by heaters in section production well in section may be opened to produce fluids from the formation. Some heat from heaters in section may transfer to section and pre heat section . The pre heating of section may create permeability in section mobilize fluids in section and allow fluids to be produced from the section through production well .

In certain embodiments a portion of section proximate production well however is not heated by conductive heating from heaters in section . For example the superposition of heat from heaters in section does not overlap the portion proximate production well in section . The portion proximate production well in section may be heated by fluids such as hydrocarbons flowing to the production well for example by convective heat transfer from the fluids .

As fluids are produced from section the movement of fluids from section to section transfers heat between the sections. The movement of the hot fluids through the formation increases heat transfer within the formation. Allowing hot fluids to flow between the sections uses the energy of the hot fluids for heating of unheated sections rather than removing the heat from the formation by producing the hot fluids directly from section . Thus the movement of the hot fluids allows for less energy input to get production from the formation than is required if heat is provided from heaters in both sections to get production from the sections.

In certain embodiments the temperature of the portion proximate production well in section is controlled so that the temperature in the portion is at most a selected temperature. For example the temperature in the portion proximate the production well may be controlled so that the temperature is at most about 100 C. at most about 200 C. or at most about 250 C. In some embodiments the temperature of the portion proximate production well in section is controlled by controlling the production rate of fluids through the production well. In some embodiments producing more fluids increases heat transfer to the production well and the temperature in the portion proximate the production well.

In some embodiments production through production well in section is reduced or turned off after the portion proximate the production well reaches the selected temperature. Reducing or turning off production through the production well at higher temperatures keeps heated fluids in the formation. Keeping the heated fluids in the formation keeps energy in the formation and reduces the energy input needed to heat the formation. The selected temperature at which production is reduced or turned off may be for example about 100 C. about 200 C. or about 250 C.

In some embodiments section and or section may be treated prior to turning on heaters to increase the permeability in the sections. For example the sections may be dewatered to increase the permeability in the sections. In some embodiments steam injection or other fluid injection may be used to increase the permeability in the sections.

In certain embodiments after a selected time heaters in section are turned on. Turning on heaters in section may provide additional heat to sections and to increase the permeability mobility and or pyrolysis of fluids in these sections. In some embodiments as heaters in section are turned on production in section is reduced or turned off shut down and production wells in section are opened to produce fluids from the formation. Thus fluid flows in the formation towards production wells in section and section is heated by the flow of hot fluids as described above for section . In some embodiments production wells in section may be left open after the heaters are turned on in the section if desired. In some embodiments production in section is reduced or turned off at the selected temperature as described above.

The process of reducing or turning off heaters and shifting production to adjacent sections may be repeated for subsequent sections in the formation. For example after a selected time heaters in section may be turned on and fluids are produced from production wells in section and so on through the formation.

In some embodiments heat is provided by heaters in alternating sections for example sections and while fluids are produced from the sections in between the heated sections for example sections and . After a selected time heaters in the unheated sections sections and are turned on and fluids are produced from one or more of the sections as desired.

In certain embodiments a smaller heater spacing is used in the staged in situ heating and producing process than in the continuous or batch in situ heat treatment processes. For example the continuous or batch in situ heat treatment process may use a heater spacing of about 12 m while the in situ staged heating and producing process uses a heater spacing of about 10 m. The staged in situ heating and producing process may use the smaller heater spacing because the staged process allows for relatively rapid heating of the formation and expansion of the formation.

In some embodiments the sequence of heated sections begins with the outermost sections and moves inwards. For example for a selected time heat may be provided by heaters in sections and as fluids are produced from sections and . After the selected time heaters in sections and may be turned on and fluids are produced from section . After another selected amount of time heaters in section may be turned on if needed.

In certain embodiments sections are substantially equal sized sections. The size and or location of sections may vary based on desired heating and or production from the formation. For example simulation of the staged in situ heating and production process treatment of the formation may be used to determine the number of heaters in each section the optimum pattern of sections and or the sequence for heater power up and production well startup for the staged in situ heating and production process. The simulation may account for properties such as but not limited to formation properties and desired properties and or quality in the produced fluids. In some embodiments heaters at the edges of the treated portions of the formation for example heaters at the left edge of section or the right edge of section may have tailored or adjusted heat outputs to produce desired heat treatment of the formation.

In some embodiments the formation is sectioned into a checkerboard pattern for the staged in situ heating and production process. depicts a top view of rectangular checkerboard pattern for the staged in situ heating and production process. In some embodiments heaters in the A sections sections A A A A and A may be turned on and fluids are produced from the B sections sections B B B B and B . After the selected time heaters in the B sections may be turned on. The size and or number of A and B sections in rectangular checkerboard pattern may be varied depending on factors such as but not limited to heater spacing desired heating rate of the formation desired production rate size of treatment area subsurface geomechanical properties subsurface composition and or other formation properties.

In some embodiments heaters in sections A are turned on and fluids are produced from sections B and or sections B. After the selected time heaters in sections A may be turned on and fluids are produced from sections B and or B. After another selected time heaters in sections A may be turned on and fluids are produced from sections B and or B. After another selected time heaters in sections A may be turned on and fluids are produced from sections B and or B. In some embodiments heaters in a B section that has been produced from may be turned on when heaters in the subsequent A section are turned on. For example heaters in section B may be turned on when the heaters in section A are turned on. Other alternating heater startup and production sequences may also be contemplated for the in situ staged heating and production process embodiment depicted in .

In some embodiments the formation is divided into a circular ring or spiral pattern for the staged in situ heating and production process. depicts a top view of the ring pattern embodiment for the staged in situ heating and production process. Sections and may be treated with heater startup and production sequences similar to the sequences described above for the embodiments depicted in . The heater startup and production sequences for the embodiment depicted in may start with section going inwards towards the center or with section going outwards from the center . Starting with section may allow expansion of the formation as heating moves towards the center of the ring pattern. Shearing of the formation may be minimized or inhibited because the formation is allowed to expand into heated and or pyrolyzed portions of the formation. In some embodiments the center section section is cooled after treatment.

In some embodiments fluids are injected to drive fluids between sections of the formation. Injecting fluids such as steam or carbon dioxide may increase the mobility of hydrocarbons and may increase the efficiency of the staged in situ heating and production process. In some embodiments fluids are injected into the formation after the in situ heat treatment process to recover heat from the formation. In some embodiments the fluids injected into the formation for heat recovery include some fluids produced from the formation for example carbon dioxide water and or hydrocarbons produced from the formation . The embodiments depicted in may be used for in situ solution mining of the formation. Hot water or another fluid may be used to get permeability in the formation at low temperatures for solution mining.

In certain embodiments several rectangular checkerboard patterns for example rectangular checkerboard pattern depicted in are used to treat a treatment area of the formation. depicts a top view of a plurality of rectangular checkerboard patterns in treatment area for the staged in situ heating and production process. Treatment area may be enclosed by barrier . Each of rectangular checkerboard patterns may individually be treated according to embodiments described above for the rectangular checkerboard patterns.

In certain embodiments the startup of treatment of rectangular checkerboard patterns proceeds in a sequential process. The sequential process may include starting the treatment of each of the rectangular checkerboard patterns one by one sequentially. For example treatment of a second rectangular checkerboard pattern for example the onset of heating of the second rectangular checkerboard pattern may be started after treatment of a first rectangular checkerboard pattern and so on. The startup of treatment of the second rectangular checkerboard pattern may be at any point in time after the treatment of the first rectangular checkerboard pattern has begun. The time selected for startup of treatment of the second rectangular checkerboard pattern may be varied depending on factors such as but not limited to desired heating rate of the formation desired production rate subsurface geomechanical properties subsurface composition and or other formation properties. In some embodiments the startup of treatment of the second rectangular checkerboard pattern begins after a selected amount of fluids have been produced from the first rectangular checkerboard pattern area or after the production rate from the first rectangular checkerboard pattern increases above a selected value or falls below a selected value.

In some embodiments the startup sequence for rectangular checkerboard patterns is arranged to minimize or inhibit expansion stresses in the formation. In an embodiment the startup sequence of the rectangular checkerboard patterns proceeds in an outward spiral sequence as shown by the arrows in . The outward spiral sequence proceeds sequentially beginning with treatment of rectangular checkerboard pattern followed by treatment of rectangular checkerboard pattern rectangular checkerboard pattern rectangular checkerboard pattern and continuing the sequence up to rectangular checkerboard pattern . Sequentially starting the rectangular checkerboard patterns in the outwards spiral sequence may minimize or inhibit expansion stresses in the formation.

Starting treatment in rectangular checkerboard patterns at or near the center of treatment area and moving outwards maximizes the starting distance from barrier . Barrier may be most likely to fail when heat is provided at or near the barrier. Starting treatment heating at or near the center of treatment area delays heating of rectangular checkerboard patterns near barrier until later times of heating in treatment area or at or near the end of production from the treatment area. Thus if barrier does fail the failure of the barrier occurs after a significant portion of treatment area has been treated.

Starting treatment in rectangular checkerboard patterns at or near the center of treatment area and moving outwards also creates open pore space in the inner portions of the outward moving startup pattern. The open pore space allows portions of the formation being started at later times to expand inwards into the open pore space and for example minimize shearing in the formation.

In some embodiments support sections are left between one or more rectangular checkerboard patterns . The support sections may be unheated sections that provide support against geomechanical shifting shearing and or expansion stress in the formation. In some embodiments some heat may be provided in the support sections. The heat provided in the support sections may be less than heat provided inside rectangular checkerboard patterns . In some embodiments each of the support sections may include alternating heated and unheated sections. In some embodiments fluids are produced from one or more of the unheated support sections.

In some embodiments one or more of rectangular checkerboard patterns have varying sizes. For example the outer rectangular checkerboard patterns such as rectangular checkerboard patterns and rectangular checkerboard patterns may have smaller areas and or numbers of checkerboards. Reducing the area and or the number of checkerboards in the outer rectangular checkerboard patterns may reduce expansion stresses and or geomechanical shifting in the outer portions of treatment area . Reducing the expansion stresses and or geomechanical shifting in the outer portions of treatment area may minimize or inhibit expansion stress and or shifting stress on barrier .

In certain embodiments heater spacing decreases as the heater pattern moves away from the production well. Thus the density of heater wells increases as the heaters get further away from the production well. depicts an embodiment with increasing heater density moving away from production well . Heaters may be arranged in a geometric for example irregular hexagonal pattern as shown in . It is to be understood that the heaters may be in any regular or irregular geometric pattern. In rows A B C and D include heaters represented by solid squares arranged in an irregular geometric pattern around production well . In some embodiments the number density of heaters in a row increases as the distance of the heaters from production well increases for example the density of heaters increases as the heaters are further away from the production well .

Decreasing the density of heaters closer to production well provides less heating at or near the production well. Less heating at or near the production well keeps lower temperatures in the production well so that less energy is removed from the formation through produced fluids and more energy is kept in the formation to heat the formation. Thus such a pattern of heaters increases waste energy recovery from the formation. Increasing waste energy recovery in the formation increases energy efficiency in treating the formation. For example treating a formation using the irregular hexagonal pattern depicted in may decrease the energy required for heating by about 17 versus treating the formation with a regular triangular pattern of heaters.

In some embodiments heaters are turned on in a sequence from outside in towards production well . As depicted in heaters in row D may be turned on first followed by heaters in row C then heaters in row B and lastly heaters in row A. Such a heater startup sequence may treat the formation similarly to the staged heating method between sections described herein with one or more of the outside heaters being spaced so that heat from the heaters does not superposition or conductively heat the production well and heat is primarily transferred through convection of fluids to the production well. For example heaters in rows A D may be considered to be in a first section of the formation and production well is in a second section adjacent to the first section. In certain embodiments the formation has sufficient permeability to allow fluids to flow to production well .

In some embodiments the temperature at or near production well is controlled so that the temperature is at most a selected temperature. For example the temperature at or near the production well may be controlled so that the temperature is at most about 100 C. at most about 150 C. at most about 200 C. or at most about 250 C. In certain embodiments the temperature at or near production well is controlled by reducing or turning off the heat provided by heaters nearest the production well for example the heaters in row A . In some embodiments the temperature at or near production well is controlled by controlling the production rate of fluids through the production well.

In certain embodiments a solvation fluid and or pressurizing fluid are used to treat the hydrocarbon formation in addition to the in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments a solvation fluid and or pressurizing fluid is used after the hydrocarbon formation has been treated using a drive process.

In some embodiments heaters are used to heat a first section the formation. For example heaters may be used to heat a first section of formation to pyrolysis temperatures to produce formation fluids. In some embodiments heaters are used to heat a first section of the formation to temperatures below pyrolysis temperatures to visbreak and or mobilize fluids in the formation. In other embodiments a first section of a formation is heated by heaters prior to during or after a drive process is used to produce formation fluids.

Residual heat from first section may transfer to portions of the formation above below and or adjacent to the first section. The transferred residual heat however may not be sufficient to mobilize the fluids in the other portions of the formation towards production wells so that recovery of the fluids from the colder sections fluids may be difficult. Addition of a fluid for example a solvation fluid and or a pressurizing fluid may solubilize and or drive the hydrocarbons in the sections of the formation heated by residual heat towards production wells. Addition of a solvating and or pressurizing fluid to portions of the formation heated by residual heat may facilitate recovery of hydrocarbons without requiring heaters to heat the additional sections. Addition of the fluid may allow for the recovery of hydrocarbons in previously produced sections and or for the recovery of viscous hydrocarbons in colder sections of the formation.

In some embodiments the formation is treated using the in situ heat treatment process for a significant time after the formation has been treated with a drive process. For example the in situ heat treatment process is used 1 year 2 years 3 years or longer after a formation has been treated using drive processes. After heating the formation for a significant amount of time using heaters and or injected fluid for example steam a solvation fluid may be added to the heated section and or portions above and or below the heated section. The in situ heat treatment process followed by addition of a solvation fluid and or a pressurizing fluid may be used on formations that have been left dormant after the drive process treatment because further hydrocarbon production using the drive process is not possible and or not economically feasible. In some embodiments the solvation fluid and or the pressurizing fluid is used to increase the amount of heat provided to the formation. In some embodiments an in situ heat treatment process may be used following addition of the solvation fluid and or pressurizing fluid to increase the recovery of hydrocarbons from the formation.

In some embodiments the solvation fluid forms an in situ solvation fluid mixture. Using the in situ solvation fluid may upgrade the hydrocarbons in the formation. The in situ solvation fluid may enhance solubilization of hydrocarbons and or and facilitate moving the hydrocarbons from one portion of the formation to another portion of the formation.

In certain embodiments the bottommost heaters are located between about 2 m and about 10 m from the bottom of hydrocarbon layer between about 4 m and about 8 m from the bottom of the hydrocarbon layer or between about 5 m and about 7 m from the bottom of the hydrocarbon layer. In certain embodiments production wells A are located at a distance from the bottommost heaters that allows heat from the heaters to superimpose over the production wells but at a distance from the heaters that inhibits coking at the production wells. Production wells A may be located a distance from the nearest heater for example the bottommost heater of at most of the spacing between heaters in the pattern of heaters for example the triangular pattern of heaters depicted in . In some embodiments production wells A are located a distance from the nearest heater of at most at most or at most of the spacing between heaters in the pattern of heaters. In certain embodiments production wells A are located between about 2 m and about 10 m from the bottommost heaters between about 4 m and about 8 m from the bottommost heaters or between about 5 m and about 7 m from the bottommost heaters. Production wells A may be located between about 0.5 m and about 8 m from the bottom of hydrocarbon layer between about 1 m and about 5 m from the bottom of the hydrocarbon layer or between about 2 m and about 4 m from the bottom of the hydrocarbon layer.

In some embodiments formation fluid is produced from first section . The formation fluid may be produced through production wells A. In some embodiments the formation fluids drain by gravity to a bottom portion of the layer. The drained fluids may be produced from production wells A positioned at the bottom portion of the layer. Production of the formation fluids may continue until a majority of condensable hydrocarbons in the formation fluid are produced. After the majority of the condensable hydrocarbons have been produced first section heat from heaters may be reduced and or discontinued to allow a reduction in temperature in the first section. In some embodiments after the majority of the condensable hydrocarbons have been produced a pressure of first section may be reduced to a selected pressure after the first section reaches the selected temperature. Selected pressures may range between about 100 kPa and about 1000 kPa between 200 kPa and 800 kPa or below a fracture pressure of the formation.

In some embodiments the formation fluid produced from production wells includes at least some pyrolyzed hydrocarbons. Some hydrocarbons may be pyrolyzed in portions of first section that are at higher temperatures than a remainder of the first section. For example portions of formation adjacent to heaters may be at somewhat higher temperatures than the remainder of first section . The higher temperature of the formation adjacent to heaters may be sufficient to cause pyrolysis of hydrocarbons. Some of the pyrolysis product may be produced through production wells .

One or more sections for example second section and or third section may be above and or below first section as depicted in . depicts second section and or third section adjacent to first section . In some embodiments second section second section and third section are outside a perimeter defined by the outermost heaters. Some residual heat from first section may transfer to second section and third section . In some embodiments sufficient residual heat is transferred to heat formation fluids to a temperature that allows the fluids to move or substantially move in second section and or third section towards productions wells . Utilization of residual heat from first section to heat hydrocarbons in second section and or third section may allow the hydrocarbons to be produced from the second section and or third section without direct heating of the sections. A minimal amount of residual heat to second section and or third section may be superposition heat from heaters . Areas of second section and or third section that are at a distance greater than the spacing between heaters may be heated by residual heat from first section . Second section and or third section may be heated by conductive and or convective heat from first section . A temperature of the sections heated by residual heat may range from 100 C. to 250 C. from 150 C. to 225 C. or from 175 C. to 200 C. depending on the proximity of heaters to second section and or third section .

In some embodiments a salvation fluid is provided to first section through injection wells A to solvate hydrocarbons within the first section. In some embodiments solvation fluid is added to first section after a majority of the condensable hydrocarbons have been produced and the first section has cooled. The salvation fluid may solvate and or dilute the hydrocarbons in first section to form a mixture of condensable hydrocarbons and solvation fluids. Formation of the mixture may increase production of hydrocarbons remaining in the first section. Solubilization of hydrocarbons in first section may allow the hydrocarbons to be produced from the first section after heat has been removed from the section. The mixture may be produced through production wells A.

In some embodiments a solvation fluid is provided to second section and or third section through injection wells B C to increase mobilization of hydrocarbons within the second section and or the third section. The solvation fluid may increase a flow of mobilized hydrocarbons into first section . For example a pressure gradient may be produced between second section and or and first section such that the flow of fluids from the second section and or third section to the first section is increased. The solvation fluid may solubilize a portion of the hydrocarbons in second section and or third section to form a mixture. Solubilization of hydrocarbons in second section and or third section may allow the hydrocarbons to be produced from the second section and or third section without direct heating of the sections. In some embodiments second section and or third section have been heated from residual heat transferred from first section prior to addition of the solvation fluid. In some embodiments the solvation fluid is added after second section and or third section have been heated to a desired temperature by heat from first section . In some embodiments heat from first section and or heat from the solvation fluid heats section and or third section to temperatures sufficient to mobilize heavy hydrocarbons in the sections. In some embodiments section and or third section are heated to temperatures ranging from 50 C. to 250 C. In some embodiments temperatures in section and or third section are sufficient to mobilize heavy hydrocarbons thus the solvation fluid may mobilize the heavy hydrocarbons by displacing the heavy hydrocarbons with minimal mixing.

In some embodiments water and or emulsified water may be used as a solvation fluid. Water may be injected into a portion of first section second section and or third section through injection wells . Addition of water to at least a selected section of first section second section and or third section may water saturate a portion of the sections. The water saturated portions of the selected section may be pressurized by known methods and a water hydrocarbon mixture may be collected using one or more production wells .

In certain embodiments first section second section and or third section may be treated with hydrocarbons for example naphtha kerosene diesel vacuum gas oil or a mixture thereof . In some embodiments the hydrocarbons have an aromatic content of at least 1 by weight at least 5 by weight at least 10 by weight at least 20 by weight or at least 25 by weight. Hydrocarbons may be injected into a portion of first section second section and or third section through injection wells . In some embodiments the hydrocarbons are produced from first section and or other portions of the formation. In certain embodiments the hydrocarbons are produced from the formation treated to remove heavy fractions of hydrocarbons for example asphaltenes hydrocarbons having a boiling point of at least 300 C. of at least 400 C. at least 500 C. or at least 600 C. and the hydrocarbons are re introduced into the formation. In some embodiments one section may be treated with hydrocarbons while another section is treated with water. In some embodiments water treatment of a section may be alternated with hydrocarbon treatment of the section. In some embodiments a first portion of hydrocarbons having a relatively high boiling range distribution for example kerosene and or diesel are introduced in one section. A second portion of hydrocarbons having a relatively low boiling range distribution or hydrocarbons of low economic value for example propane may be introduced into the section after the first portion of hydrocarbons. The introduction of hydrocarbons of different boiling range distributions may enhance recovery of the higher boiling hydrocarbons and more economically valuable hydrocarbons through production wells .

In an embodiment a blend made from hydrocarbon mixtures produced from first section is used as a solvation fluid. The blend may include about 20 by weight light hydrocarbons or blending agent or greater for example about 50 by weight or about 80 by weight light hydrocarbons and about 80 by weight heavy hydrocarbons or less for example about 50 by weight or about 20 by weight heavy hydrocarbons . The weight percentage of light hydrocarbons and heavy hydrocarbons may vary depending on for example a weight distribution or API gravity of light and heavy hydrocarbons an aromatic content of the hydrocarbons a relative stability of the blend or a desired API gravity of the blend. For example the weight percentage of light hydrocarbons in the blend may at most 50 by weight or at most 20 by weight. In certain embodiments the weight percentage of light hydrocarbons may be selected to mix the least amount of light hydrocarbons with heavy hydrocarbons that produces a blend with a desired density or viscosity.

In some embodiments polymers and or monomers may be used as solvation fluids. Polymers and or monomers may solvate and or drive hydrocarbons to allow mobilization of the hydrocarbons towards one or more production wells. The polymer and or monomer may reduce the mobility of a water phase in pores of the hydrocarbon containing formation. The reduction of water mobility may allow the hydrocarbons to be more easily mobilized through the hydrocarbon containing formation. Polymers that may be used include but are not limited to polyacrylamides partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide polyacrylates ethylenic copolymers biopolymers carboxymethylcellulose polyvinyl alcohol polystyrene sulfonates polyvinylpyrrolidone AMPS 2 acrylamide 2 methyl propane sulfonate or combinations thereof. Examples of ethylenic copolymers include copolymers of acrylic acid and acrylamide acrylic acid and lauryl acrylate lauryl acrylate and acrylamide.

In some embodiments pressure is maintained by controlling flow of the pressurizing fluid into the selected section. In other embodiments the pressure is controlled by varying a location or locations for injecting the pressurizing fluid. In other embodiments pressure is maintained by controlling a pressure and or production rate at production wells . In some embodiments the pressurized fluid for example carbon dioxide is separated from the produced fluids and re introduced into the formation. After production has been stopped the fluid may be sequestered in the formation.

In certain embodiments formation fluid is produced from first section second section and or third section . The formation fluid may be produced through production wells . The formation fluid produced from second section and or third section may include solvation fluid hydrocarbons from first section second section and or third section and or mixtures thereof.

During an in situ heat treatment process some formation fluid may migrate outwards from the treatment area. The formation fluid may include benzene and or other contaminants. Some portions of the formation that contaminants migrate to will be subsequently treated when a new treatment area is defined and processed using the in situ heat treatment process. Such contaminants may be removed or destroyed by the subsequent in situ heat treatment process. Some areas of the formation to which contaminants migrate may not become part of a new treatment area subjected to in situ heat treatment.

The temperature that the low temperature heater wells raise the formation to may be less than 260 C. less than 230 C. or less than 200 C. In some embodiments heating elements in migration inhibition wells may be tailored so that the heating elements only heat portions of the formation that have permeability sufficient to allow for the migration of fluid for example fracture systems and or to allow for introduction of fluid from the migration inhibition wells.

In some embodiments one or more heater wells may be installed adjacent to the migration inhibition wells . The heater wells may heat adjacent formation to an average temperature less than the dissociation temperature of minerals in the formation and or less than the pyrolysis temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation. The heater wells may increase the permeability of the formation adjacent to migration inhibition wells . Heating elements in the heater wells may be tailored to only heat portions of the formation that have permeability sufficient to allow for migration of fluid and or introduction of fluid from migration inhibition wells into the formation.

The sweep fluid may move through fractures in the formation toward or into treatment area . The sweep fluid may carry fluids that have migrated away from treatment area back to the treatment area. The pressure of the fluid introduced through migration inhibition wells may be maintained below the fracture pressure of the formation.

After an in situ process energy recovery remediation and or sequestration of carbon dioxide or other fluids in the treated area the treatment area may still be at an elevated temperature. Sulfur may be introduced into the formation to act as a drive fluid to remove remaining formation fluid from the formation. The sulfur may be introduced through outermost wellbores in the formation. The wellbores may be injection wells production wells monitor wells heater wells barrier wells or other types of wells that are converted to use as sulfur injection wells. The sulfur may be used to drive fluid inwards towards production wells in the pattern of wells used during the in situ heat treatment process. The wells used as production wells for sulfur may be production wells heater wells injection wells monitor wells or other types of wells converted for use as sulfur production wells.

In some embodiments sulfur may be introduced in the treatment area from an outermost set of wells. Formation fluid may be produced from a first inward set of wellbores until substantially only sulfur is produced from the first inward set of wells. The first inward set of wells may be converted to injection wells. Sulfur may be introduced in the first inward set of wells to drive remaining formation fluid towards a second inward set of wells. The pattern may be continued until sulfur has been introduced into all of the treatment area. In some embodiments a line drive may be used for introducing the sulfur into the treatment area.

In some embodiments molten sulfur may be injected into the treatment area. The molten sulfur may act as a displacement agent that moves and or entrains remaining fluid in the treatment area. The molten sulfur may be injected into the formation from selected wells. The sulfur may be at a temperature near a melting point of sulfur so that the sulfur has a relatively low viscosity. In some embodiments the formation may be at a temperature above the boiling point of sulfur. Sulfur may be introduced into the formation as a gas or as a liquid.

Sulfur may be introduced into the formation until substantially only sulfur is produced from the last sulfur production well or production wells. When substantially only sulfur is produced from the last sulfur production well or production wells introduction of additional sulfur may be stopped and the production from the production well or production wells may be stopped. Sulfur in the formation may be allowed to remain in the formation and solidify.

Alternative energy sources may be used to supply electricity for subsurface electric heaters. Alternative energy sources include but are not limited to wind off peak power hydroelectric power geothermal solar and tidal wave action. Some of these alternative energy sources provide intermittent time variable power or power variable power. To provide power for subsurface electric heaters power provided by these alternative energy sources may be conditioned to produce power with appropriate operating parameters for example voltage frequency and or current for the subsurface heaters.

In some embodiments gas turbine is used to generate electricity to power heaters . Windmill and or gas turbine may be coupled to transformer . Transformer may convert power from windmill and or gas turbine into electrical power with appropriate operating parameters for heaters for example AC or DC power with appropriate voltage current and or frequency may be generated by the transformer .

In certain embodiments tap controller is coupled to transformer control system and heaters . Tap controller may monitor and control transformer to maintain a constant voltage to heaters regardless of the load of the heaters. Tap controller may control power output in a range from 5 MVA megavolt amps to 500 MVA from 10 MVA to 400 MVA or from 20 MVA to 300 MVA. Tap controller may be designed to meet selected design requirements such as but not limited to load limitations of components such as transformer control system and or heaters and the expected full load current in the electrical circuit. Tap controller may be an electromechanical mechanical electrical electromagnetic or solid state tap controller. In one embodiments tap controller is a 32 step 16 steps electromechanical tap controller obtained from ABB Ltd. Asea Brown Boveri Zurich Switzerland . Tap controller may be a step controller that changes power in steps over a period of time for example 1 step per minute . Tap controller may operated over a percentage of the total range for example 15 of the voltage or 10 of the voltage .

As an example during operation an overload of voltage may be sent from transformer . Tap controller may modify the load provided to heaters and distribute the excess load to other heaters and or other equipment in need of power. In some embodiments tap controller may store the excess load for future use.

Control system may control tap controller . Control system may be for example a computer controller or an analog logic system. Control system may use data supplied from power sensors to generate predictive algorithms and or control tap controller . For example data may be an amount of power generated from windmill gas turbine and or transformer . Data may also include an amount of resistive load of heaters . Power sensors may be toroidal current sensors that output voltages that are proportional to the currents in wires passing through the sensors.

Automatic voltage regulation for resistive load of a heater enhances the life of the heaters and or allows constant heat output from the heaters to a subsurface formation. Adjusting the load demands instead of adjusting the power source allows enhanced control of power supplied to heaters and or other equipment that requires electricity. Power supplied to heaters may be controlled within selected limits for example a power supplied and or controlled to a heater within 1 5 10 or 20 of power required by the heater . Control of power supplied from alternative energy sources may allow output of prime power at its rating allow energy produced for example from an intermittent source a subsurface formation or a hydroelectric source to be stored and used later and or allow use of power generated by intermittent power sources to be used as a constant source of energy.

Some hydrocarbon containing formations such as oil shale formations may include nahcolite trona dawsonite and or other minerals within the formation. In some embodiments nahcolite is contained in partially unleached or unleached portions of the formation. Unleached portions of the formation are parts of the formation where minerals have not been removed by groundwater in the formation. For example in the Piceance basin in Colorado U.S.A. unleached oil shale is found below a depth of about 500 m below grade. Deep unleached oil shale formations in the Piceance basin center tend to be relatively rich in hydrocarbons. For example about 0.10 liters to about 0.15 liters of oil per kilogram L kg of oil shale may be producible from an unleached oil shale formation.

Nahcolite is a mineral that includes sodium bicarbonate NaHCO . Nahcolite may be found in formations in the Green River lakebeds in Colorado U.S.A. In some embodiments at least about 5 weight at least about 10 weight or at least about 20 weight nahcolite may be present in the formation. Dawsonite is a mineral that includes sodium aluminum carbonate NaAl CO OH . Dawsonite is typically present in the formation at weight percents greater than about 2 weight or in some embodiments greater than about 5 weight . Nahcolite and or dawsonite may dissociate at temperatures used in an in situ heat treatment process. The dissociation is strongly endothermic and may produce large amounts of carbon dioxide.

Nahcolite and or dawsonite may be solution mined prior to during and or following treatment of the formation in situ to avoid dissociation reactions and or to obtain desired chemical compounds. In certain embodiments hot water or steam is used to dissolve nahcolite in situ to form an aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution before the in situ heat treatment process is used to process hydrocarbons in the formation. Nahcolite may form sodium ions Na and bicarbonate ions HCO in aqueous solution. The solution may be produced from the formation through production wells thus avoiding dissociation reactions during the in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments dawsonite is thermally decomposed to alumina during the in situ heat treatment process for treating hydrocarbons in the formation. The alumina is solution mined after completion of the in situ heat treatment process.

Production wells and or injection wells used for solution mining and or for in situ heat treatment processes may include smart well technology. The smart well technology allows the first fluid to be introduced at a desired zone in the formation. The smart well technology allows the second fluid to be removed from a desired zone of the formation.

Formations that include nahcolite and or dawsonite may be treated using the in situ heat treatment process. A perimeter barrier may be formed around the portion of the formation to be treated. The perimeter barrier may inhibit migration of water into the treatment area. During solution mining and or the in situ heat treatment process the perimeter barrier may inhibit migration of dissolved minerals and formation fluid from the treatment area. During initial heating a portion of the formation to be treated may be raised to a temperature below the dissociation temperature of the nahcolite. The temperature may be at most about 90 C. or in some embodiments at most about 80 C. The temperature may be any temperature that increases the solvation rate of nahcolite in water but is also below a temperature at which nahcolite dissociates above about 95 C. at atmospheric pressure .

A first fluid may be injected into the heated portion. The first fluid may include water brine steam or other fluids that form a solution with nahcolite and or dawsonite. The first fluid may be at an increased temperature for example about 90 C. about 95 C. or about 100 C. The increased temperature may be similar to the temperature of the portion of the formation.

In some embodiments the first fluid is injected at an increased temperature into a portion of the formation that has not been heated by heat sources. The increased temperature may be a temperature below a boiling point of the first fluid for example about 90 C. for water. Providing the first fluid at an increased temperature increases a temperature of a portion of the formation. In certain embodiments additional heat may be provided from one or more heat sources in the formation during and or after injection of the first fluid.

In other embodiments the first fluid is or includes steam. The steam may be produced by forming steam in a previously heated portion of the formation for example by passing water through u shaped wellbores that have been used to heat the formation by heat exchange with fluids produced from the formation and or by generating steam in standard steam production facilities. In some embodiments the first fluid may be fluid introduced directly into a hot portion of the portion and produced from the hot portion of the formation. The first fluid may then be used as the first fluid for solution mining.

In some embodiments heat from a hot previously treated portion of the formation is used to heat water brine and or steam used for solution mining a new portion of the formation. Heat transfer fluid may be introduced into the hot previously treated portion of the formation. The heat transfer fluid may be water steam carbon dioxide and or other fluids. Heat may transfer from the hot formation to the heat transfer fluid. The heat transfer fluid is produced from the formation through production wells. The heat transfer fluid is sent to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger may heat water brine and or steam used as the first fluid to solution mine the new portion of the formation. The heat transfer fluid may be reintroduced into the heated portion of the formation to produce additional hot heat transfer fluid. In some embodiments heat transfer fluid produced from the formation is treated to remove hydrocarbons or other materials before being reintroduced into the formation as part of a remediation process for the heated portion of the formation.

Steam injected for solution mining may have a temperature below the pyrolysis temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation. Injected steam may be at a temperature below 250 C. below 300 C. or below 400 C. The injected steam may be at a temperature of at least 150 C. at least 135 C. or at least 125 C. Injecting steam at pyrolysis temperatures may cause problems as hydrocarbons pyrolyze and hydrocarbon fines mix with the steam. The mixture of fines and steam may reduce permeability and or cause plugging of production wells and the formation. Thus the injected steam temperature is selected to inhibit plugging of the formation and or wells in the formation.

The temperature of the first fluid may be varied during the solution mining process. As the solution mining progresses and the nahcolite being solution mined is farther away from the injection point the first fluid temperature may be increased so that steam and or water that reaches the nahcolite to be solution mined is at an elevated temperature below the dissociation temperature of the nahcolite. The steam and or water that reaches the nahcolite is also at a temperature below a temperature that promotes plugging of the formation and or wells in the formation for example the pyrolysis temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation .

A second fluid may be produced from the formation following injection of the first fluid into the formation. The second fluid may include material dissolved in the first fluid. For example the second fluid may include carbonic acid or other hydrated carbonate compounds formed from the dissolution of nahcolite in the first fluid. The second fluid may also include minerals and or metals. The minerals and or metals may include sodium aluminum phosphorus and other elements.

Solution mining the formation before the in situ heat treatment process allows initial heating of the formation to be provided by heat transfer from the first fluid used during solution mining. Solution mining nahcolite or other minerals that decompose or dissociate by means of endothermic reactions before the in situ heat treatment process avoids having energy supplied to heat the formation being used to support these endothermic reactions. Solution mining allows for production of minerals with commercial value. Removing nahcolite or other minerals before the in situ heat treatment process removes mass from the formation. Thus less mass is present in the formation that needs to be heated to higher temperatures and heating the formation to higher temperatures may be achieved more quickly and or more efficiently. Removing mass from the formation also may increase the permeability of the formation. Increasing the permeability may reduce the number of production wells needed for the in situ heat treatment process. In certain embodiments solution mining before the in situ heat treatment process reduces the time delay between startup of heating of the formation and production of hydrocarbons by two years or more.

In some formations a portion of the formation with unleached minerals may be below a leached portion of the formation. The unleached portion may be thick and substantially impermeable. A treatment area may be formed in the unleached portion. Unleached portion of the formation to the sides above and or below the treatment area may be used as barriers to fluid flow into and out of the treatment area. A first treatment area may be solution mined to remove minerals increase permeability in the treatment area and or increase the richness of the hydrocarbons in the treatment area. After solution mining the first treatment area in situ heat treatment may be used to treat a second treatment area. In some embodiments the second treatment area is the same as the first treatment area. In some embodiments the second treatment has a smaller volume than the first treatment area so that heat provided by outermost heat sources to the formation do not raise the temperature of unleached portions of the formation to the dissociation temperature of the minerals in the unleached portions.

In some embodiments a leached or partially leached portion of the formation above an unleached portion of the formation may include significant amounts of hydrocarbon materials. An in situ heating process may be used to produce hydrocarbon fluids from the unleached portions and the leached or partially leached portions of the formation. depicts a representation of a formation with unleached zone below leached zone . Unleached zone may have an initial permeability before solution mining of less than 0.1 millidarcy. Solution mining wells may be placed in the formation. Solution mining wells may include smart well technology that allows the position of first fluid entrance into the formation and second flow entrance into the solution mining wells to be changed. Solution mining wells may be used to form first treatment area in unleached zone . Unleached zone may initially be substantially impermeable. Unleached portions of the formation may form a top barrier and side barriers around first treatment area . After solution mining first treatment area the portions of solution mining wells adjacent to the first treatment area may be converted to production wells and or heater wells.

Heat sources in first treatment area may be used to heat the first treatment area to pyrolysis temperatures. In some embodiments one or more heat sources are placed in the formation before first treatment area is solution mined. The heat sources may be used to provide initial heating to the formation to raise the temperature of the formation and or to test the functionality of the heat sources. In some embodiments one or more heat sources are installed during solution mining of the first treatment area or after solution mining is completed. After solution mining heat sources may be used to raise the temperature of at least a portion of first treatment area above the pyrolysis and or mobilization temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation to result in the generation of mobile hydrocarbons in the first treatment area.

Barrier wells may be introduced into the formation. Ends of barrier wells may extend into and terminate in unleached zone . Unleached zone may be impermeable. In some embodiments barrier wells are freeze wells. Barrier wells may be used to form a barrier to fluid flow into or out of unleached zone . Barrier wells overburden and the unleached material above first treatment area may define second treatment area . In some embodiments a first fluid may be introduced into second treatment area through solution mining wells to raise the initial temperature of the formation in second treatment area and remove any residual soluble minerals from the second treatment area. In some embodiments the top barrier above first treatment area may be solution mined to remove minerals and combine first treatment area and second treatment area into one treatment area. After solution mining heat sources may be activated to heat the treatment area to pyrolysis temperatures.

Water inside treatment area may be pumped out of the treatment area through injection wells and or production wells . In certain embodiments injection wells are used as production wells and vice versa the wells are used as both injection wells and production wells . Water may be pumped out until a production rate of water is low or stops.

Heat may be provided to treatment area from heat sources . Heat sources may be operated at temperatures that do not result in the pyrolysis of hydrocarbons in the formation adjacent to the heat sources. In some embodiments treatment area is heated to a temperature from about 90 C. to about 120 C. for example a temperature of about 90 C. 95 C. 100 C. 110 C. or 120 C. . In certain embodiments heat is provided to treatment area from the first fluid injected into the formation. The first fluid may be injected at a temperature from about 90 C. to about 120 C. for example a temperature of about 90 C. 95 C. 100 C. 110 C. or 120 C. . In some embodiments heat sources are installed in treatment area after the treatment area is solution mined. In some embodiments some heat is provided from heaters placed in injection wells and or production wells . A temperature of treatment area may be monitored using temperature measurement devices placed in monitoring wells and or temperature measurement devices in injection wells production wells and or heat sources .

The first fluid is injected through one or more injection wells . In some embodiments the first fluid is hot water. The first fluid may mix and or combine with non hydrocarbon material that is soluble in the first fluid such as nahcolite to produce a second fluid. The second fluid may be removed from the treatment area through injection wells production wells and or heat sources . Injection wells production wells and or heat sources may be heated during removal of the second fluid. Heating one or more wells during removal of the second fluid may maintain the temperature of the fluid during removal of the fluid from the treatment area above a desired value. After producing a desired amount of the soluble non hydrocarbon material from treatment area solution remaining within the treatment area may be removed from the treatment area through injection wells production wells and or heat sources . The desired amount of the soluble non hydrocarbon material may be less than half of the soluble non hydrocarbon material a majority of the soluble non hydrocarbon material substantially all of the soluble non hydrocarbon material or all of the soluble non hydrocarbon material. Removing soluble non hydrocarbon material may produce a relatively high permeability treatment area .

Hydrocarbons within treatment area may be pyrolyzed and or produced using the in situ heat treatment process following removal of soluble non hydrocarbon materials. The relatively high permeability treatment area allows for easy movement of hydrocarbon fluids in the formation during in situ heat treatment processing. The relatively high permeability treatment area provides an enhanced collection area for pyrolyzed and mobilized fluids in the formation. During the in situ heat treatment process heat may be provided to treatment area from heat sources . A mixture of hydrocarbons may be produced from the formation through production wells and or heat sources . In certain embodiments injection wells are used as either production wells and or heater wells during the in situ heat treatment process.

In some embodiments a controlled amount of oxidant for example air and or oxygen is provided to treatment area at or near heat sources when a temperature in the formation is above a temperature sufficient to support oxidation of hydrocarbons. At such a temperature the oxidant reacts with the hydrocarbons to provide heat in addition to heat provided by electrical heaters in heat sources . The controlled amount of oxidant may facilitate oxidation of hydrocarbons in the formation to provide additional heat for pyrolyzing hydrocarbons in the formation. The oxidant may more easily flow through treatment area because of the increased permeability of the treatment area after removal of the non hydrocarbon materials. The oxidant may be provided in a controlled manner to control the heating of the formation. The amount of oxidant provided is controlled so that uncontrolled heating of the formation is avoided. Excess oxidant and combustion products may flow to production wells in treatment area .

Following the in situ heat treatment process treatment area may be cooled by introducing water to produce steam from the hot portion of the formation. Introduction of water to produce steam may vaporize some hydrocarbons remaining in the formation. Water may be injected through injection wells . The injected water may cool the formation. The remaining hydrocarbons and generated steam may be produced through production wells and or heat sources . Treatment area may be cooled to a temperature near the boiling point of water. The steam produced from the formation may be used to heat a first fluid used to solution mine another portion of the formation.

Treatment area may be further cooled to a temperature at which water will condense in the formation. Water and or solvent may be introduced into and be removed from the treatment area. Removing the condensed water and or solvent from treatment area may remove any additional soluble material remaining in the treatment area. The water and or solvent may entrain non soluble fluid present in the formation. Fluid may be pumped out of treatment area through production well and or heat sources . The injection and removal of water and or solvent may be repeated until a desired water quality within treatment area is achieved. Water quality may be measured at the injection wells heat sources and or production wells. The water quality may substantially match or exceed the water quality of treatment area prior to treatment.

In some embodiments treatment area may include a leached zone located above an unleached zone. The leached zone may have been leached naturally and or by a separate leaching process. In certain embodiments the unleached zone may be at a depth of at least about 500 m. A thickness of the unleached zone may be between about 100 m and about 500 m. However the depth and thickness of the unleached zone may vary depending on for example a location of treatment area and or the type of formation. In certain embodiments the first fluid is injected into the unleached zone below the leached zone. Heat may also be provided into the unleached zone.

In certain embodiments a section of a formation may be left untreated by solution mining and or unleached. The unleached section may be proximate a selected section of the formation that has been leached and or solution mined by providing the first fluid as described above. The unleached section may inhibit the flow of water into the selected section. In some embodiments more than one unleached section may be proximate a selected section.

Nahcolite may be present in the formation in layers or beds. Prior to solution mining such layers may have little or no permeability. In certain embodiments solution mining layered or bedded nahcolite from the formation causes vertical shifting in the formation. depicts an embodiment of a formation with nahcolite layers in the formation below overburden and before solution mining nahcolite from the formation. Hydrocarbon layers A have substantially no nahcolite and hydrocarbon layers B have nahcolite. depicts the formation of after the nahcolite has been solution mined. Layers B have collapsed due to the removal of the nahcolite from the layers. The collapsing of layers B causes compaction of the layers and vertical shifting of the formation. The hydrocarbon richness of layers B is increased after compaction of the layers. In addition the permeability of layers B may remain relatively high after compaction due to removal of the nahcolite. The permeability may be more than 5 darcy more than 1 darcy or more than 0.5 darcy after vertical shifting. The permeability may provide fluid flow paths to production wells when the formation is treated using an in situ heat treatment process. The increased permeability may allow for a large spacing between production wells. Distances between production wells for the in situ heat treatment system after solution mining may be greater than 10 m greater than 20 m or greater than 30 meters. Heater wells may be placed in the formation after removal of nahcolite and the subsequent vertical shifting. Forming heater wellbores and or installing heaters in the formation after the vertical shifting protects the heaters from being damaged due to the vertical shifting.

In certain embodiments removing nahcolite from the formation interconnects two or more wells in the formation. Removing nahcolite from zones in the formation may increase the permeability in the zones. Some zones may have more nahcolite than others and become more permeable as the nahcolite is removed. At a certain time zones with the increased permeability may interconnect two or more wells for example injection wells or production wells in the formation.

In some embodiments a treatment area has nahcolite beds above and or below the treatment area. The nahcolite beds may be relatively thin for example about 5 m to about 10 m in thickness . In an embodiment the nahcolite beds are solution mined using horizontal solution mining wells in the nahcolite beds. The nahcolite beds may be solution mined in a short amount of time for example in less than 6 months . After solution mining of the nahcolite beds the treatment area and the nahcolite beds may be heated using one or more heaters. The heaters may be placed either vertically horizontally or at other angles within the treatment area and the nahcolite beds. The nahcolite beds and the treatment area may then undergo the in situ heat treatment process.

In some embodiments the solution mining wells in the nahcolite beds are converted to production wells. The production wells may be used to produce fluids during the in situ heat treatment process. Production wells in the nahcolite bed above the treatment area may be used to produce vapors or gas for example gas hydrocarbons from the formation. Production wells in the nahcolite bed below the treatment area may be used to produce liquids for example liquid hydrocarbons from the formation.

In some embodiments the second fluid produced from the formation during solution mining is used to produce sodium bicarbonate. Sodium bicarbonate may be used in the food and pharmaceutical industries in leather tanning in fire retardation in wastewater treatment and in flue gas treatment flue gas desulphurization and hydrogen chloride reduction . The second fluid may be kept pressurized and at an elevated temperature when removed from the formation. The second fluid may be cooled in a crystallizer to precipitate sodium bicarbonate.

In some embodiments the second fluid produced from the formation during solution mining is used to produce sodium carbonate which is also referred to as soda ash. Sodium carbonate may be used in the manufacture of glass in the manufacture of detergents in water purification polymer production tanning paper manufacturing effluent neutralization metal refining sugar extraction and or cement manufacturing. The second fluid removed from the formation may be heated in a treatment facility to form sodium carbonate soda ash and or sodium carbonate brine. Heating sodium bicarbonate will form sodium carbonate according to the equation 2NaHCO NaCO CO HO. EQN. 6 

In certain embodiments the heat for heating the sodium bicarbonate is provided using heat from the formation. For example a heat exchanger that uses steam produced from the water introduced into the hot formation may be used to heat the second fluid to dissociation temperatures of the sodium bicarbonate. In some embodiments the second fluid is circulated through the formation to utilize heat in the formation for further reaction. Steam and or hot water may also be added to facilitate circulation. The second fluid may be circulated through a heated portion of the formation that has been subjected to the in situ heat treatment process to produce hydrocarbons from the formation. At least a portion of the carbon dioxide generated during sodium carbonate dissociation may be adsorbed on carbon that remains in the formation after the in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments the second fluid is circulated through conduits previously used to heat the formation.

In some embodiments higher temperatures are used in the formation for example above about 120 C. above about 130 C. above about 150 C. or below about 250 C. during solution mining of nahcolite. The first fluid is introduced into the formation under pressure sufficient to inhibit sodium bicarbonate from dissociating to produce carbon dioxide. The pressure in the formation may be maintained at sufficiently high pressures to inhibit such nahcolite dissociation but below pressures that would result in fracturing the formation. In addition the pressure in the formation may be maintained high enough to inhibit steam formation if hot water is being introduced in the formation. In some embodiments a portion of the nahcolite may begin to decompose in situ. In such cases nahcolite is removed from the formation as soda ash. If soda ash is produced from solution mining of nahcolite the soda ash may be transported to a separate facility for treatment. The soda ash may be transported through a pipeline to the separate facility.

As described above in certain embodiments following removal of nahcolite from the formation the formation is treated using the in situ heat treatment process to produce formation fluids from the formation. In some embodiments the formation is treating using the in situ heat treatment process before solution mining nahcolite from the formation. The nahcolite may be converted to sodium carbonate from sodium bicarbonate during the in situ heat treatment process. The sodium carbonate may be solution mined as described above for solution mining nahcolite prior to the in situ heat treatment process.

In some formations dawsonite is present in the formation. Dawsonite within the heated portion of the formation decomposes during heating of the formation to pyrolysis temperature. Dawsonite typically decomposes at temperatures above 270 C. according to the reaction 2NaAl OH CO NaCO AlO 2HO CO. EQN. 7 

Sodium carbonate may be removed from the formation by solution mining the formation with water or other fluid into which sodium carbonate is soluble. In certain embodiments alumina formed by dawsonite decomposition is solution mined using a chelating agent. The chelating agent may be injected through injection wells production wells and or heater wells used for solution mining nahcolite and or the in situ heat treatment process for example injection wells production wells and or heat sources depicted in . The chelating agent may be an aqueous acid. In certain embodiments the chelating agent is EDTA ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid . Other examples of possible chelating agents include but are not limited to ethylenediamine porphyrins dimercaprol nitrilotriacetic acid diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid phosphoric acids acetic acid acetoxy benzoic acids nicotinic acid pyruvic acid citric acid tartaric acid malonic acid imidizole ascorbic acid phenols hydroxy ketones sebacic acid and boric acid. The mixture of chelating agent and alumina may be produced through production wells or other wells used for solution mining and or the in situ heat treatment process for example injection wells production wells and or heat sources which are depicted in . The alumina may be separated from the chelating agent in a treatment facility. The recovered chelating agent may be recirculated back to the formation to solution mine more alumina.

In some embodiments alumina within the formation may be solution mined using a basic fluid after the in situ heat treatment process. Basic fluids include but are not limited to sodium hydroxide ammonia magnesium hydroxide magnesium carbonate sodium carbonate potassium carbonate pyridine and amines. In an embodiment sodium carbonate brine such as 0.5 Normal NaCO is used to solution mine alumina. Sodium carbonate brine may be obtained from solution mining nahcolite from the formation. Obtaining the basic fluid by solution mining the nahcolite may significantly reduce costs associated with obtaining the basic fluid. The basic fluid may be injected into the formation through a heater well and or an injection well. The basic fluid may combine with alumina to form an alumina solution that is removed from the formation. The alumina solution may be removed through a heater well injection well or production well.

Alumina may be extracted from the alumina solution in a treatment facility. In an embodiment carbon dioxide is bubbled through the alumina solution to precipitate the alumina from the basic fluid. Carbon dioxide may be obtained from dissociation of nahcolite from the in situ heat treatment process or from decomposition of the dawsonite during the in situ heat treatment process.

In certain embodiments a formation may include portions that are significantly rich in either nahcolite or dawsonite only. For example a formation may contain significant amounts of nahcolite for example at least about 20 weight at least about 30 weight or at least about 40 weight in a depocenter of the formation. The depocenter may contain only about 5 weight or less dawsonite on average. However in bottom layers of the formation a weight percent of dawsonite may be about 10 weight or even as high as about 25 weight . In such formations it may be advantageous to solution mine for nahcolite only in nahcolite rich areas such as the depocenter and solution mine for dawsonite only in the dawsonite rich areas such as the bottom layers. This selective solution mining may significantly reduce fluid costs heating costs and or equipment costs associated with operating the solution mining process.

In certain formations dawsonite composition varies between layers in the formation. For example some layers of the formation may have dawsonite and some layers may not. In certain embodiments more heat is provided to layers with more dawsonite than to layers with less dawsonite. Tailoring heat input to provide more heat to certain dawsonite layers more uniformly heats the formation as the reaction to decompose dawsonite absorbs some of the heat intended for pyrolyzing hydrocarbons. depicts an embodiment for heating a formation with dawsonite in the formation. Hydrocarbon layer may be cored to assess the dawsonite composition of the hydrocarbon layer. The mineral composition may be assessed using for example FTIR Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy or x ray diffraction. Assessing the core composition may also assess the nahcolite composition of the core. After assessing the dawsonite composition heater may be placed in wellbore . Heater includes sections to provide more heat to hydrocarbon layers with more dawsonite in the layers hydrocarbon layers D . Hydrocarbon layers with less dawsonite hydrocarbon layers C are provided with less heat by heater . Heat output of heater may be tailored by for example adjusting the resistance of the heater along the length of the heater. In one embodiment heater is a temperature limited heater described herein that has a higher temperature limit for example higher Curie temperature in sections proximate layers D as compared to the temperature limit Curie temperature of sections proximate layers C. The resistance of heater may also be adjusted by altering the resistive conducting materials along the length of the heater to supply a higher energy input watts per meter adjacent to dawsonite rich layers.

Solution mining dawsonite and nahcolite may be relatively simple processes that produce alumina and soda ash from the formation. In some embodiments hydrocarbons produced from the formation using the in situ heat treatment process may be fuel for a power plant that produces direct current DC electricity at or near the site of the in situ heat treatment process. The produced DC electricity may be used on the site to produce aluminum metal from the alumina using the Hall process. Aluminum metal may be produced from the alumina by melting the alumina in a treatment facility on the site. Generating the DC electricity at the site may save on costs associated with using hydrotreaters pipelines or other treatment facilities associated with transporting and or treating hydrocarbons produced from the formation using the in situ heat treatment process.

In some embodiments acid may be introduced into the formation through selected wells to increase the porosity adjacent to the wells. For example acid may be injected if the formation comprises limestone or dolomite. The acid used to treat the selected wells may be acid produced during in situ heat treatment of a section of the formation for example hydrochloric acid or acid produced from byproducts of the in situ heat treatment process for example sulfuric acid produced from hydrogen sulfide or sulfur .

In some embodiments a saline rich zone is located at or near an unleached portion of the formation. The saline rich zone may be an aquifer in which water has leached out nahcolite and or other minerals. A high flow rate may pass through the saline rich zone. Saline water from the saline rich zone may be used to solution mine another portion of the formation. In certain embodiments a steam and electricity cogeneration facility may be used to heat the saline water prior to use for solution mining.

Treatment area may have significant amounts of nahcolite. Saline zone is located at or near treatment area . In certain embodiments zone is located up dip from treatment area . Zone may be leached or partially leached such that the zone is mainly filled with saline water.

In certain embodiments saline water is removed pumped from zone using production well . Production well may be located at or near the lowest portion of zone so that saline water flows into the production well. Saline water removed from zone is heated to hot water and or steam temperatures in facility . Facility may burn hydrocarbons to run generators that produce electricity. Facility may burn gaseous and or liquid hydrocarbons to make electricity. In some embodiments pulverized coal is used to make electricity. The electricity generated may be used to provide electrical power for heaters or other electrical operations for example pumping . Waste heat from the generators is used to make hot water and or steam from the saline water. After the in situ heat treatment process of one or more treatment areas results in the production of hydrocarbons at least a portion of the produced hydrocarbons may be used as fuel for facility .

The hot water and or steam made by facility is provided to solution mining well . Solution mining well is used to solution mine treatment area . Nahcolite and or other minerals are removed from treatment area by solution mining well . The nahcolite may be removed as a nahcolite solution from treatment area . The solution removed from treatment area may be a brine solution with dissolved nahcolite. Heat from the removed nahcolite solution may be used in facility to heat saline water from zone and or other fluids. The nahcolite solution may then be injected through injection well into zone . In some embodiments injection well injects the nahcolite solution into zone up dip from production well . Injection may occur a significant distance up dip so that nahcolite solution may be continuously injected as saline water is removed from the zone without the two fluids substantially intermixing. In some embodiments the nahcolite solution from treatment area is provided to injection well without passing through facility the nahcolite solution bypasses the facility .

The nahcolite solution injected into zone may be left in the zone permanently or for an extended period of time for example after solution mining production well may be shut in . In some embodiments the nahcolite stored in zone is accessed at later times. The nahcolite may be produced by removing saline water from zone and processing the saline water to make sodium bicarbonate and or soda ash.

Solution mining using saline water from zone and heat from facility to heat the saline water may be a high efficiency process for solution mining treatment area . Facility is efficient at providing heat to the saline water. Using the saline water to solution mine decreases costs associated with pumping and or transporting water to the treatment site. Additionally solution mining treatment area preheats the treatment area for any subsequent heat treatment of the treatment area enriches the hydrocarbon content in the treatment area by removing nahcolite and or creates more permeability in the treatment area by removing nahcolite.

In certain embodiments treatment area is further treated using an in situ heat treatment process following solution mining of the treatment area. A portion of the electricity generated in facility may be used to power heaters for the in situ heat treatment process.

In some embodiments a perimeter barrier may be formed around the portion of the formation to be treated. The perimeter barrier may inhibit migration of formation fluid into or out of the treatment area. The perimeter barrier may be a frozen barrier and or a grout barrier. After formation of the perimeter barrier the treatment area may be processed to produce desired products.

Formations that include non hydrocarbon materials may be treated to remove and or dissolve a portion of the non hydrocarbon materials from a section of the formation before hydrocarbons are produced from the section. In some embodiments the non hydrocarbon materials are removed by solution mining. Removing a portion of the non hydrocarbon materials may reduce the carbon dioxide generation sources present in the formation. Removing a portion of the non hydrocarbon materials may increase the porosity and or permeability of the section of the formation. Removing a portion of the non hydrocarbon materials may result in a raised temperature in the section of the formation.

After solution mining some of the wells in the treatment may be converted to heater wells injection wells and or production wells. In some embodiments additional wells are formed in the treatment area. The wells may be heater wells injection wells and or production wells. Logging techniques may be employed to assess the physical characteristics including any vertical shifting resulting from the solution mining and or the composition of material in the formation. Packing baffles or other techniques may be used to inhibit formation fluid from entering the heater wells. The heater wells may be activated to heat the formation to a temperature sufficient to support combustion.

One or more production wells may be positioned in permeable sections of the treatment area. Production wells may be horizontally and or vertically oriented. For example production wells may be positioned in areas of the formation that have a permeability of greater than 5 darcy or 10 darcy. In some embodiments production wells may be positioned near a perimeter barrier. A production well may allow water and production fluids to be removed from the formation. Positioning the production well near a perimeter barrier enhances the flow of fluids from the warmer zones of the formation to the cooler zones.

Heat may be provided to treatment area through heaters positioned in injection wells . In some embodiments the heaters in injection wells heat formation adjacent to the injections wells to temperatures sufficient to support combustion. Heaters in injection wells may raise the formation near the injection wells to temperatures from about 90 C. to about 120 C. or higher for example a temperature of about 90 C. 95 C. 100 C. 110 C. or 120 C. .

Injection wells may be used to introduce a combustion fuel an oxidant steam and or a heat transfer fluid into treatment area either before during or after heat is provided to treatment area from heaters. In some embodiments injection wells are in communication with each other to allow the introduced fluid to flow from one well to another. Injection wells may be located at positions that are relatively far away from perimeter barrier . Introduced fluid may cause combustion of hydrocarbons in treatment area . Heat from the combustion may heat treatment area and mobilize fluids toward production wells .

A temperature of treatment area may be monitored using temperature measurement devices placed in monitoring wells and or temperature measurement devices in injection wells production wells and or heater wells.

In some embodiments a controlled amount of oxidant for example air and or oxygen is provided in injection wells to advance a heat front towards production wells . In some embodiments the controlled amount of oxidant is introduced into the formation after solution mining has established permeable interconnectivity between at least two injection wells. The amount of oxidant is controlled to limit the advancement rate of the heat front and to limit the temperature of the heat front. The advancing heat front may pyrolyze hydrocarbons. The high permeability in the formation allows the pyrolyzed hydrocarbons to spread in the formation towards production wells without being overtaken by the advancing heat front.

Vaporized formation fluid and or gas formed during the combustion process may be removed through gas wells and or injection wells . Venting of gases through gas wells and or injection wells may force the combustion front in a desired direction.

In some embodiments the formation may be heated to a temperature sufficient to cause pyrolysis of the formation fluid by the steam and or heat transfer fluid. The steam and or heat transfer fluid may be heated to temperatures of about 300 C. about 400 C. about 500 C. or about 600 C. In certain embodiments the steam and or heat transfer fluid may be co injected with the fuel and or oxidant.

Gases may be produced during in situ heat treatment processes and during many conventional production processes. Some of the produced gases for example carbon dioxide and or hydrogen sulfide when introduced into water may change the pH of the water to less than 7. Such gases are typically referred to as sour gas or acidic gas. Introducing sour gas from produced fluid into subsurface formations may reduce or eliminate the need for or size of certain surface facilities for example a Claus plant or Scot gas treater . Introducing sour gas from produced formation fluid into subsurface formations may make the formation fluid more acceptable for transportation use and or processing. Removal of sour gas having a low heating value for example carbon dioxide from formation fluids may increase the caloric value of the gas stream separated from the formation fluid.

Net release of sour gas to the atmosphere and or conversion of sour gas to other compounds may be reduced by utilizing the produced sour gas and or by storing the sour gas within subsurface formations. In some embodiments the sour gas is stored in deep saline aquifers. Deep saline aquifers may be at depths of about 900 m or more below the surface. The deep saline aquifers may be relatively thick and permeable. A thick and relatively impermeable formation strata may be located over deep saline aquifers. For example 500 m or more of shale may be located above the deep saline aquifer. The water in the deep saline aquifer may be unusable for agricultural or other common uses because of the high mineral content in the water. Over time the minerals in the water may react with introduced sour gas to form precipitates in the deep saline aquifer. The deep saline aquifer used to store sour gas may be below the treatment area at another location in the same formation or in another formation. If the deep saline aquifer is located at another location in the same formation or in another formation the sour gas may be transported to the deep saline aquifer by pipeline.

In some embodiments injection wells used to inject sour gas may be vertical slanted and or directionally steered wells with a significant horizontal or near horizontal portion. The horizontal or near horizontal portion of the injection well may be located near or at the bottom of the deep saline aquifer. depicts a representation of an embodiment of a system for injection of sour gases produced from the in situ heat treatment process into the deep saline aquifer. Formation fluids may be produced from hydrocarbon layer . In certain embodiments formation fluids are produced using an in situ heat treatment process through production well . The sour gas for example gas including at least carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide may be separated from the formation fluids in gas liquid separator using known gas liquid separation techniques.

The separated sour gas may be transported to formation via conduit for example a pipeline . Formation may include aquifer for example a deep saline aquifer and barrier portion for example shale . The sour gas may be injected into deep saline aquifer through injection well . Injection well may have vertical portion and horizontal portion . Horizontal portion may be near or at the bottom of deep saline aquifer . The sour gas may be less dense than formation fluid in the deep saline aquifer. The sour gas may diffuse upwards in the aquifer towards barrier layer . Horizontal portion may allow injection of the sour gas in a large portion of deep saline aquifer . Openings in horizontal portion may be critical flow orifices so that fluid is introduced substantially equally along the length of the horizontal portion.

Cement may be used to seal conduit in formation. Cement used in injection wellbores to form seals at the surface and or at an interface of deep saline aquifer with barrier layer may be selected so that the cement does not degrade due to the temperature pressure and chemical environment due to exposure to sour gas.

The deep saline aquifer or aquifers used to store sour gas may be at sufficient depth such that the carbon dioxide in the sour gas is introduced in the formation in a supercritical state. Supercritical carbon dioxide injection may maximize the density of the fluid introduced into the formation. The depths of outlets of injection wells used to introduce acidic gases in the formation may be 900 m or more below the surface.

Injection of sour gas into a non producing formation and or using sour gas as flooding agents are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7 128 150 to Thomas et al. RE 39 244 to Eaton RE 39 077 to Eaton 6 755 251 to Thomas et al. 6 283 230 to Peters all of which are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.

During production of formation fluids from a subsurface formation acidic gases may react with water in the formation and produce acids. For example carbonic acid may be produced from the reaction of carbon dioxide with water during heating of the formation. Portions of wells made of certain materials such as carbon steel may start to deteriorate or corrode in the presence of the produced acids. To inhibit corrosion due to produced acids for example carbonic acid fluids and or polymers for example corrosion inhibitors foaming agents surfactants basic fluids hydrocarbons high density polyethylene or mixtures thereof may be introduced in the wellbore to neutralize and or dissolve the acids.

In some embodiments hydrogen sulfide and or carbon dioxide are separated from the produced gases and introduced into one or more wellbores in a subsurface formation. Water present in the gas introduced into the formation may interact with hydrogen sulfide to form a sulfide layer on metal surfaces of the injection well. Formation of the sulfide layer may inhibit further corrosion of the metal surfaces of the injection well by carbonic acid and or other acids. The formation of the sulfide layer may allow for the use of carbon steel or other relatively inexpensive alloys during the introduction of sour gas into subsurface formations.

In certain embodiments a temperature measurement tool assesses the active impedance of an energized heater. The temperature measurement tool may utilize the frequency domain analysis algorithm associated with Partial Discharge measurement technology PD coupled with timed domain reflectometer measurement technology TDR . A set of frequency domain analysis tools may be applied to a TDR signature. This process may provide unique information in the analysis of the energized heater such as but not limited to an impedance log of the entire length of the heater per unit length. The temperature measurement tool may provide certain advantages for assessing the temperature of a downhole heater.

In certain embodiments the temperature measurement tool assesses the impedance per unit length and gives a profile on the entire length of the heated section of the heater. The impedance profile may be used in association with laboratory data for the heater such as temperature and resistance profiles for heaters measured at various loads and frequencies to assess the temperature per unit length of the heated section. The impedance profile may also be used to assess various computer models for heaters that are used in association with the reservoir simulations.

In certain embodiments the temperature measurement tool assesses an accurate impedance profile of a heater in a specific formation after a number of heater wells have been installed and energized in the specific formation. The accurate impedance profile may assess the actual reactive and real power consumption for each heater that is used similarly. This information may be used to properly size surface electrical distribution equipment and or eliminate any extra capacity designed to accommodate any anticipated heater impedance turndown ratio or any unknown power factor or reactive power consumption for the heaters.

In certain embodiments the temperature measurement tool is used to troubleshoot malfunctioning heaters and assess the impedance profile of the length of the heated section. The impedance profile may be able to accurately predict the location of a faulted section and its relative impedance to ground. This information may be used to accurately assess the appropriate reduction in surface voltage to allow the heater to continue to operate in a limited capacity. This method may be more preferable than abandoning the heater in the formation.

In certain embodiments frequency domain PD testing offers an improved set of PD characterization tools. A basic set of frequency domain PD testing tools are described in The Case for Frequency Domain PD Testing In The Context Of Distribution Cable Steven Boggs 19 Issue 4 July August 2003 pages 13 19 which is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. Frequency domain PD detection sensitivity under field conditions may be one to two orders of magnitude greater than for time domain testing as a result of there not being a need to trigger on the first PD pulse above the broadband noise and the filtering effect of the cable between the PD detection site and the terminations. As a result of this greatly increased sensitivity and the set of characterization tools frequency domain PD testing has been developed into a highly sensitive and reliable tool for characterizing the condition of distribution cable during normal operation while the cable is energized the sensitivity and accuracy of which have been confirmed through independent testing.

In some embodiments a method of treating formation that has previously undergone an in situ heat treatment process includes providing a recovery fluid to the formation. The recovery fluid may include but is not limited to water steam air oxygen carbon dioxide methane and or other non condensable hydrocarbon gases and or mixtures thereof. Heat from one or more heat sources may provide heat to a section of the formation. In some embodiments contact of formation fluid with the recovery fluid may generate heat through oxidation of the formation fluid and or solid hydrocarbons in the formation for example coke . The formation may be heated or allowed to heat to temperatures ranging from about 200 C. to about 1200 C. or from about 300 C. to about 1000 C. or from about 500 C. to about 800 C. Heating of the formation in the presence of the recovery fluid may reduce coke in the formation and produce gas. Once the recovery process has been completed one or more heated portions of the formation may be used as an in situ reactor and or reaction zone to treat formation fluid and or hydrocarbons from surface facilities. Using one or more heated portions of the formation to treat such hydrocarbons may reduce or eliminate the need for surface facilities that treat such fluids for example coking units and or delayed coking units .

A catalyst system may be introduced to the heated portion of the formation. In some embodiments the portion of the formation is heated after and or during introduction of the catalyst system. The catalyst system may be provided to the formation by injection of the catalyst system into an injection well and or a production well in the section of the formation to be treated. In some embodiments the catalyst system may be positioned in a well bore proximate the section of the formation to be treated.

The catalyst system may be provided to the formation with a carrier fluid. The carrier fluid may include but is not limited to hydrocarbons water steam in situ heat treatment process gas hydrogen or mixtures thereof. In some embodiments the catalyst system is slurried with the carrier fluid and or another fluid and the slurry is introduced to the heated portion of the formation. In some embodiments carrier fluid is a liquid and the formation may have sufficient heat to vaporize at least a portion of the carrier fluid. Vaporization of the carrier fluid may leave at least a portion of the catalyst system in the formation and or in a well bore.

The catalyst system may include one or more catalysts. The catalysts may be supported or unsupported catalysts. Catalysts include but are not limited to alkali metal carbonates alkali metal hydroxides alkali metal hydrides alkali metal amides alkali metal sulfides alkali metal acetates alkali metal oxalates alkali metal formates alkali metal pyruvates alkaline earth metal carbonates alkaline earth metal hydroxides alkaline earth metal hydrides alkaline earth metal amides alkaline earth metal sulfides alkaline earth metal acetates alkaline earth metal oxalates alkaline earth metal formates alkaline earth metal pyruvates or commercially available fluid catalytic cracking catalysts dolomite any catalyst that promotes formation of aromatic hydrocarbons or mixtures thereof.

Hydrocarbons may be introduced into the heated portion of the formation. In some embodiments the catalyst system is slurried with a portion of the hydrocarbons and the slurry is introduced to the heated portion of the formation. The introduced hydrocarbons may be hydrocarbons in formation fluid from an adjacent portion of the formation condensable hydrocarbons that have been previously produced or created in surface facilities that would need to be further treated to produce desirable products. Such hydrocarbons may be introduced into the formation through one or more injection wells. Such hydrocarbons may include residue asphaltenes bitumen or other types of hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbons may contact the catalyst system to produce desirable products for example visbroken hydrocarbons and or cracked hydrocarbons . The desirable products may be removed from the formation.

In some embodiments the desirable products may include aromatics. The aromatics may solubilize a portion of the heavy hydrocarbons in the formation. The mixture of desirable products and heavy hydrocarbons may be produced from the formation. In some embodiments the mixture of hydrocarbons and formation fluid may drain to a bottom portion of a layer and solubilize additional hydrocarbons at the bottom of the layer. The resulting mixture may be produced from production wells positioned at the bottom of the layer.

Heating the formation in the presence of the hydrocarbons may mobilize formation fluids in the heated first portion to allow the formation fluid to contact the catalyst system. In some embodiments heating the first portion may increase permeability of the formation and allow formation fluid for example bitumen from a second portion of the formation to flow into the heated first portion and contact the catalyst system. In some embodiments the fluids may be driven to the heated portion of the formation using a drive fluid for example carbon dioxide and or steam .

In some embodiments a portion of the formation may be heated to a temperature to mobilize formation fluids for example temperatures of at least 200 C. . At least a portion of the mobilized fluids may be produced from the formation. The catalyst system may be introduced after a portion of the mobilized fluids have been removed. The catalyst system may be introduced in a carrier fluid and or as a slurry. Contact of the catalyst system with at least a portion of the mobilized fluids may produce hydrocarbons having a lower API gravity than the mobilized fluids.

The fluid mixture produced from contact of hydrocarbons formation fluid and or mobilized fluids with the catalyst system may be produced from the formation. In certain embodiments the fluid mixture may be produced through a production well. The liquid hydrocarbon portion of the fluid mixture may have an API gravity between 10 and 25 between 12 and 23 or between 15 and 20 . In some embodiments the produce mixture has at most 0.25 grams of aromatics per gram of total hydrocarbons. In some embodiments the produced mixture includes some of the catalysts and or used catalysts.

During contacting impurities for example coke nitrogen containing compounds sulfur containing compounds and or metals such as nickel and or vanadium may form on the catalyst. Removal of the impurities on the catalyst in situ may enhance catalyst life. In situ removal of the impurities may be performed through combustion of the catalyst. In some embodiments an oxidant for example air oxygen and or synthesis gas generating fluid may be introduced into the formation and the formation is heated to a temperature sufficient to allow combustion of impurities on the catalyst to occur.

Contact of the hydrocarbons with catalyst system may produce coke. The amount of coke may be reduced by introduction of an oxidant for example air and or synthesis gas generating fluid . Oxidation of the coke may produce gases. In some embodiments the formation may be heated to initiate oxidation of the coke. The produced gases may be removed from the formation through one or more production wells.

Additional catalysts may be introduced into the formation during the contacting process after a portion of the coke has been removed from the existing catalyst and or after reduction of coke in the formation to continue the treatment process.

During or after solution mining and or the in situ heat treatment process some existing cased heater wells and or some existing cased monitor wells may be converted into production wells and or injection wells. Existing cased wells may be converted to production and or injection wells by perforating a portion of the well casing with perforation devices that utilize explosives. Also some production wells may be perforated at one or more cased locations to facilitate removal of formation fluid through newly opened sections in the production wells. In some embodiments perforation devices may be used in open wellbores to fracture formation adjacent to the wellbore.

In some embodiments pre perforated portions of wells are installed. Coverings may initially be placed over the perforations. At a desired time the covering of the perforations may be removed to open additional portions of the wells or to convert the wells to production wells and or injections wells. Knowing which wells will need to be converted to production wells and or injection wells may not be apparent at the time of well installation. Using pre perforated wells for all wells may be prohibitively expensive.

Perforation devices may be used to form openings in a well. Perforation devices may be obtained from for example Schlumberger USA Sugar Land Tex. USA . Perforation devices may include but are not limited to capsule guns and or hollow carrier guns. Perforation devices may use explosives to form openings in a well. The well may need to be at a relatively cool temperature to inhibit premature detonation of the explosives. Temperature exposure limits of some explosives commonly used for perforation devices are a maximum exposure of 1 hour to a temperature of about 260 C. and a maximum exposure of 10 hours to a temperature of about 210 C. In some embodiments the well is cooled before use of the perforation device. In some embodiments the perforation device is insulated to inhibit heat transfer to the perforation device. The use of insulation may not be suitable for wells with portions that are at high temperature for example above 300 C. .

In some embodiments the perforation device is equipped with a circulated fluid cooling system. The circulated fluid cooling system may keep the temperature of the perforation device below a desired value. Keeping the temperature of the perforation device below a selected temperature may inhibit premature denotation of explosives in the perforation device.

One or more temperature sensing devices may be included in the circulated fluid cooling system to allow temperatures in the well and or near the perforating device to be observed. After insertion into the well the perforation device may be activated to form openings in the well. The openings may be of sufficient size to allow fluid to be pumped through the well after removal of the perforation device positioning apparatus.

Sleeve may be coupled to outer tubing by connector . In some embodiments outer tubing is a coiled tubing string and connector is a threaded connection. Sleeve may be a thin walled sleeve. In some embodiments sleeve is made of a polymer. Sleeve may have minimal thickness to maximize explosive performance of perforation device yet still be sufficiently strong to support the forces applied to the sleeve by the hydrostatic column and circulation of cooling fluid.

Inner tubing may be positioned inside of outer tubing . In some embodiments inner tubing is a coiled tubing string. Support may be coupled to inner tubing by connector . In some embodiments support is a pipe and connector and is a threaded connection. Perforation device may be secured to the outside of support . A number of perforation devices may be secured to the outside of the support in series. Using a number of perforation devices may allow a long length of perforations to be formed in the well on a single trip of circulated fluid cooling system into the well.

Temperature sensor and control cable may be positioned through inner tubing and support . Temperature sensor may be a fiber optic cable or plurality of thermocouples that are capable of sensing temperature at various locations in circulated fluid cooling system . Control cable may be coupled to perforation device . A signal may be sent through control cable to detonate explosives in perforation device .

Cooling fluid may flow downwards through inner tubing and support and return to the surface past perforation device in the space between the support and sleeve and in the space between the inner tubing and outer tubing . Cooling fluid may be water glycol or any other suitable heat transfer fluid.

In some embodiments a long length of support and sleeve may be left below perforation device as a dummy section. Temperature measurements taken by temperature sensor in the dummy section may be used to monitor the temperature rise of the leading portion of circulated fluid cooling system as the circulated fluid cooling system is introduced into the well. The dummy section may also be a temperature buffer for perforation device that inhibits rapid temperature rise in the perforation device. In other embodiments the circulated fluid cooling system may be introduced into the well without perforation devices to determine so that the temperature increase the perforation device will be exposed to will be known before the perforation device is placed in the well.

To use circulated fluid cooling system the circulated fluid cooling system is lowered into the well. Cooling fluid keeps the temperature of perforation device below temperatures that may result in the premature detonation of explosives of the perforation device. After the perforation device is positioned at the desired location in the well circulation of cooling fluid is stopped. In some embodiments cooling fluid is removed from circulated fluid cooling system . Then control cable may be used to detonate the explosives of perforation device to form openings in the well. Outer tubing and inner tubing may be removed from the well and the remaining portions of sleeve and or support may be disconnected from the outer tubing and the inner tubing.

To perforate another well a new perforation device may be secured to the support if the support is reusable. The support may be coupled to inner tubing and a new sleeve may be coupled to the outer tubing. The newly reformed circulated fluid cooling system may be deployed in the well to be perforated.

Many wells may be used to treat the hydrocarbon formation using the in situ heat treatment process. In some embodiments vertical and or substantially vertical wells are formed in the formation. In some embodiments horizontal and or U shaped wells are formed in the formation. In some embodiments combinations of horizontal and vertical wells are formed in the formation. Horizontal and or vertical wells may extend through the overburden of the formation. Heat from either horizontal and or vertical wells may be lost to the overburden. Surface and or overburden infrastructures used to support heaters and or production wells in horizontal wellbores may be large in size and or numerous. Positioning heaters heater power sources production equipment supply lines and or other heater or production support equipment in substantially horizontal tunnels and or inclined tunnels may reduce allow reductions in size of heaters and or other equipment used to treat the formation reduce energy costs for treating the formation reduce emissions from the treatment process facilitate heating system installation and or reduce heat loss to the overburden as compared to conventional hydrocarbon recovery processes that utilize surface based equipment. U.S. Published Patent Application Nos. 2007 0044957 to Watson et al. 2008 0017416 to Watson et al. and 2008 0078552 to Donnelly et al. all of which are incorporated herein by reference describe methods of drilling from a shaft for underground recovery of hydrocarbons and methods of underground recovery of hydrocarbons.

The underground workspace may be sealed from the formation pressure and formation fluids. For example the underground workspace may have an impermeable barrier to seal the workspace from the formation. In some embodiments the impermeable barrier is a cement barrier. The underground workspace may have at least one entry point to surface .

Shafts may be sunk or formed in overburden and or hydrocarbon layer using methods known in the art for drilling and or sinking mine shafts. Shafts may connect surface with overburden and or hydrocarbon layer . In certain embodiments shafts are substantially vertical have a circular cross section and have dimensions suitable to allow ventilation materials vehicles and personnel access. In some embodiments shafts have a diameter of at least 1 m or greater. A distance between two shafts may be at least 100 m or greater. In some embodiments shafts proximate to heater tunnels are sealed for example filled with cement after heating has been initiated in hydrocarbon layer to inhibit gas or other fluids from entering the shaft .

In some embodiments utility shafts are placed between two shafts. A distance between utility shafts may be about 200 m 500 m or 1000 m. Utility shafts may include equipment or structures such as but not limited to power supply legs production risers and or ventilation openings.

In certain embodiments tunnels extend outward from shafts . Tunnels may be located in the overburden of the formation hydrocarbon layer of the formation and or in the underburden of the formation. In some embodiments tunnels are located in an impermeable portion of the hydrocarbon formation. For example tunnels may be located in a portion of the formation having permeability of about 1 millidarcy. Tunnels may be substantially horizontal or inclined. Tunnels may connect at least two shafts . A shape of ends of tunnels may be rectangular circular elliptical or horseshoe shaped. Ends and portions of the lengths of tunnels may have cross sections large enough for personnel equipment and or vehicles to pass through the ends of the tunnels. Tunnels may include heater tunnels and or utilities tunnels .

In certain embodiments wellbores are formed substantially vertically substantially horizontally or inclined in hydrocarbon layer by drilling into the hydrocarbon layer from tunnels . In some embodiments injection wells and monitoring wells are extended from tunnels . Drilling wellbores from tunnels may increase drilling efficiency and decrease drilling time and length because the wellbores do not have to be drilled through overburden . Drilling from tunnels and subsequent placement of equipment in the tunnels may reduce a surface equipment footprint as compared to conventional surface drilling methods. In some embodiments heater wellbores interconnect with utility tunnels . In some embodiments utilities tunnel is positioned between two heater tunnels . It should be understood that the any number of tunnels and or any order of tunnels may be used as contemplated or desired. Using shafts and tunnels in combination with in situ treatment to produce hydrocarbons from the formation may be beneficial because the overburden section is eliminated from both heater construction and drilling requirements. In some embodiments a least a portion of the shafts and tunnels are located below the aquifers in or above the hydrocarbon containing formation. Locating the shafts and tunnels in such a manner may reduce contamination risk to the aquifers and may simplify abandonment of the shafts and tunnels after production.

In some embodiments wellbores are directionally drilled to utility tunnels as shown in . Directional drilling to intersect utility tunnel can be easier than directional drilling to intersect another wellbore in the formation. Drilling equipment such as but not limited to magnetic transmission equipment magnetic sensing equipment acoustic transmission equipment and acoustic sensing equipment may be located in the utility tunnels and used for directional drilling of the heater wellbores. The drilling equipment may be removed from the utility tunnel after directional drilling is completed.

In certain embodiments subsurface end connections for heaters and or subsurface connections between heater elements are made in utility tunnels . Physical connections between heater elements may be made in the utility tunnels . For example physical connections may be made between heater elements and a bus bar located in the utility tunnel. The bus bar may be used to provide electrical connection to the ends of the heater elements.

In some embodiments the physical connections are made manually in the utility tunnel . In some embodiments utilities tunnel includes power equipment necessary to operate heat sources and production equipment for example transformers and voltage regulators depicted in . In certain embodiments voltage regulators are located in power chamber . Power chamber may connect to utility shaft . Supply lines depicted in in utility shaft may supply power to heat sources through voltage regulators and transformers in utility tunnels . Utility tunnels may allow for easier quicker and or more effective maintenance repair and or replacement of the subsurface connections.

In some embodiments heat sources are located in wellbores that extend from heater tunnels and or interconnect with utility tunnels as depicted in and . Examples of heat sources include but are not limited to molten salts closed looped molten salt circulating systems insulated conductors temperature limited heaters induction heaters fluid transport systems and or pulverized coal systems.

Introduction of heat sources through heater tunnels allows hydrocarbon layer to be heated without significant heat losses to overburden . Being able to provide heat mainly to hydrocarbon layer with low heat losses in the overburden may enhance heater efficiency. For example the savings in heating costs may be at least 15 . By using tunnels to provide heaters only in the hydrocarbon layer and not requiring significant heater wellbore sections in the overburden may decrease heater costs by at least 30 at least 50 at least 60 or at least 70 as compared to heater costs using heaters that have sections passing through the overburden. Providing heaters through tunnels may allow optimal heater density to be obtained thus resulting in faster production from the formation. Closer spacing of heaters may be economically beneficial due to a significantly lower cost per additional heater. For example heaters located in the hydrocarbon layer by drilling through the overburden are typically spaced about 11 m apart. Using tunnels to space heaters the heaters may be spaced about 6.5 m apart in the hydrocarbon layer. The closer spacing may accelerate first production by 4 to 5 years as compared to the years for first production obtained from heaters that are spaced 11 m apart. This acceleration in first production may reduce the heating requirement by at least 15 .

In some embodiments heat sources of various lengths providing different amounts of heata at different locations may be used in wellbores proximate heater tunnels instead of pumps to control viscosity of formation fluids in production wells .

In some embodiments at least two tunnels may connect to one shaft. Two or more heater wellbores may extend from the first tunnel to the second tunnel. Heated fluid may flow through the wellbores from the first tunnel to the second tunnel. The second tunnel may include a production system that is capable of removing the heated fluids from the formation to the surface of the formation. The second tunnel may include equipment that collects heated fluids from at least two of the heater wellbores. The heated fluids may be moved to the surface through a vertical production wellbore using a lift system.

As shown in heater tunnels may include heat source section connecting section and or drilling section . In heat source section heat sources may be introduced into wellbores . In some embodiments heat source section is considered a hazardous confined space. Heat source section may be isolated from other sections in heater tunnel and or utility tunnel with material impermeable to hydrocarbon gases and or hydrogen sulfide. For example cement or another impermeable material may be used to seal off heat source section from heater tunnel and or utility tunnel . In some embodiments impermeable material is used to seal off heat source section from the heated portion of the formation to inhibit formation fluids or other hazardous fluids from entering the heat source section. In some embodiments at least 30 m at least 40 m or at least 50 m of wellbore is between heat sources and the heater tunnel. In some embodiments shafts proximate to heater tunnels are sealed for example filled with cement after heating has been initiated in hydrocarbon layer to inhibit gas or other fluids from entering the shaft.

Connecting section may separate heat source section and drilling section . Connecting section may include space for performing operations necessary for production processing. In some embodiments heaters controls may be located in connecting section . In some embodiments connecting section includes electrical connections combustors tanks and or pumps necessary to support heaters and or heat transport systems. In some embodiments exhaust from combustors and or other equipment is introduced to the hydrocarbon layer to provide additional heat.

In drilling section additional wellbores may be dug and or the tunnel may be extended. In certain embodiments operations in heat source section connecting section and or production section are independent of each other. Heat source section connecting section and or production section may have dedicated ventilation systems and or connections to utilities tunnel .

Sections of heater tunnels and utilities tunnel may be interconnected by connecting tunnels . Connecting tunnels may allow access and egress to heat source section connecting section and or production section . Connecting tunnels and tunnels may be formed using tunneling methods known in the art.

In certain embodiments connecting tunnels include airlocks . Airlocks may help regulate the relative pressures such that the pressure in heat source section is less than the air pressure in connecting section which is less than the air pressure in production section . Air flow may move into heat source section the most hazardous area to reduce the probability of a flammable atmosphere in utilities tunnel connecting section and or production section . Airlocks may include suitable gas detection and alarms to ensure transformers or other electrical equipment are de energized in the event that an unsafe flammable limit is encountered in the utilities tunnel for example less than one half of the lower flammable limit .

Heat from heat sources may mobilize hydrocarbons in the hydrocarbon layer towards production wells. Production wells may be are positioned in hydrocarbon layer below adjacent or above tunnels . In some embodiments production systems may be installed in one or more tunnels. The tunnel production systems may be operated from surface facilities and or facilities in the tunnel. As shown in production well is positioned in hydrocarbon layer below tunnels . In some embodiments production wells connect to surface facilities as shown in . As shown in pipelines may be located in portions of heater tunnels . Pumps and associated equipment for production of formation fluids may be located in production chambers . Production chambers may be isolated from heater tunnels . Risers and or pumps in production chambers may be located in utility shafts that connect to surface .

In some embodiments formation fluids may gravity drain into a piping holding facilities and or vertical production wells located in a production portion of the tunnels . The production portion of the tunnel may be sealed with an impervious material for example cement or a steel liner as described above . The formation fluids may be pumped to the surface through a riser and or vertical production well located in the tunnels. For example formation fluids from four horizontal production wellbores spaced 60 m apart may drain into one vertical production well located in tunnel. The formation fluids are produced to the surface through the vertical production well.

A 6 foot temperature limited heater element was placed in a 6 foot 347H stainless steel canister. The heater element was connected to the canister in a series configuration. The heater element and canister were placed in an oven. The oven was used to raise the temperature of the heater element and the canister. At varying temperatures a series of electrical currents were passed through the heater element and returned through the canister. The resistance of the heater element and the power factor of the heater element were determined from measurements during passing of the electrical currents.

Data depicts electrical resistance versus temperature for 300 A at 60 Hz AC applied current. Data depicts resistance versus temperature for 400 A at 60 Hz AC applied current. Data depicts resistance versus temperature for 500 A at 60 Hz AC applied current. Curve depicts resistance versus temperature for 10 A DC applied current. The resistance versus temperature data indicates that the AC resistance of the temperature limited heater linearly increased up to a temperature near the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. Near the Curie temperature the AC resistance decreased rapidly until the AC resistance equaled the DC resistance above the Curie temperature. The linear dependence of the AC resistance below the Curie temperature at least partially reflects the linear dependence of the AC resistance of 347H at these temperatures. Thus the linear dependence of the AC resistance below the Curie temperature indicates that the majority of the current is flowing through the 347H support member at these temperatures.

Data depicts resistance versus temperature for 100 A at 60 Hz AC applied current. Data depicts resistance versus temperature for 400 A at 60 Hz AC applied current. Curve depicts resistance versus temperature for 10 A DC. The AC resistance of this temperature limited heater turned down at a higher temperature than the previous temperature limited heater. This was due to the added cobalt increasing the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. The AC resistance was substantially the same as the AC resistance of a tube of 347H steel having the dimensions of the support member. This indicates that the majority of the current is flowing through the 347H support member at these temperatures. The resistance curves in are generally the same shape as the resistance curves in .

From the data in the experiments for the temperature limited heater with the copper core the iron cobalt ferromagnetic conductor and the 347H stainless steel support member the turndown ratio y axis was calculated as a function of the maximum power W m delivered by the temperature limited heater. The results of these calculations are depicted in . The curve in shows that the turndown ratio y axis remains above 2 for heater powers up to approximately 2000 W m. This curve is used to determine the ability of a heater to effectively provide heat output in a sustainable manner. A temperature limited heater with the curve similar to the curve in would be able to provide sufficient heat output while maintaining temperature limiting properties that inhibit the heater from overheating or malfunctioning.

A theoretical model has been used to predict the experimental results. The theoretical model is based on an analytical solution for the AC resistance of a composite conductor. The composite conductor has a thin layer of ferromagnetic material with a relative magnetic permeability 1 sandwiched between two non ferromagnetic materials whose relative magnetic permeabilities and are close to unity and within which skin effects are negligible. An assumption in the model is that the ferromagnetic material is treated as linear. In addition the way in which the relative magnetic permeability is extracted from magnetic data for use in the model is far from rigorous.

Magnetic data was obtained for carbon steel as a ferromagnetic material. B versus H curves and hence relative permeabilities were obtained from the magnetic data at various temperatures up to 1100 F. and magnetic fields up to 200 Oe oersteds . A correlation was found that fitted the data well through the maximum permeability and beyond. depicts examples of relative magnetic permeability y axis versus magnetic field Oe for both the found correlations and raw data for carbon steel. Data is raw data for carbon steel at 400 F. Data is raw data for carbon steel at 1000 F. Curve is the found correlation for carbon steel at 400 F. Curve is the found correlation for carbon steel at 1000 F.

For the dimensions and materials of the copper carbon steel 347H heater element in the experiments above theoretical calculations were carried out to calculate magnetic field at the outer surface of the carbon steel as a function of skin depth. Results of the theoretical calculations were presented on the same plot as skin depth versus magnetic field from the correlations applied to the magnetic data from . The theoretical calculations and correlations were made for four temperatures 200 F. 500 F. 800 F. and 1100 F. and five total root mean square RMS currents 100 A 200 A 300 A 400 A and 500 A .

The skin depths obtained from the intersections of the same temperature curves in were input into equations based on theory and the AC resistance per unit length was calculated. The total AC resistance of the entire heater including that of the canister was subsequently calculated. A comparison between the experimental and numerical calculated results is shown in for currents of 300 A experimental data and numerical curve 400 A experimental data and numerical curve and 500 A experimental data and numerical curve . Though the numerical results exhibit a steeper trend than the experimental results the theoretical model captures the close bunching of the experimental data and the overall values are quite reasonable given the assumptions involved in the theoretical model. For example one assumption involved the use of a permeability derived from a quasistatic B H curve to treat a dynamic system.

One feature of the theoretical model describing the flow of alternating current in the three part temperature limited heater is that the AC resistance does not fall off monotonically with increasing skin depth. shows the AC resistance m per foot of the heater element as a function of skin depth in. at 1100 F. calculated from the theoretical model. The AC resistance may be maximized by selecting the skin depth that is at the peak of the non monotonical portion of the resistance versus skin depth profile for example at about 0.23 in. in .

A numerical simulation FLUENT available from Fluent USA Lebanon N.H. U.S.A. was used to compare operation of temperature limited heaters with three turndown ratios. The simulation was done for heaters in an oil shale formation Green River oil shale . Simulation conditions were 

Simulations have been performed to compare the use of temperature limited heaters and non temperature limited heaters in an oil shale formation. Simulation data was produced for conductor in conduit heaters placed in 16.5 cm 6.5 inch diameter wellbores with 12.2 m 40 feet spacing between heaters using a formation simulator for example STARS and a near wellbore simulator for example ABAQUS from ABAQUS Inc. Providence R.I. U.S.A. . Standard conductor in conduit heaters included 304 stainless steel conductors and conduits. Temperature limited conductor in conduit heaters included a metal with a Curie temperature of 760 C. for conductors and conduits. Results from the simulations are depicted in .

Simulations using STARS were carried out to simulate heating a formation using the heater embodiments shown in . The simulation used insulated conductor heaters with Alloy 180 cores with various diameters inside jackets with a diameter of 0.625 and magnesium oxide insulation between the cores and jackets for example core electrical insulator and jacket in . The various core diameters used were 0.125 0.115 0.1084 and 0.1016 . The various core diameters produced selected amounts of heater power in the heater using three insulated conductors in the conduit for the heater . depicts a plot of heater power W ft versus core diameter in. . As shown in core diameters of 0.1016 provides a heater power of about 220 W ft core diameters of 0.1084 provides a heater power of about 250 W ft core diameters of 0.115 provides a heater power of about 280 W ft and core diameters of 0.125 provides a heater power of about 333 W ft.

For the simulation the insulated conductor heaters were placed in a conduit for example conduit in with an outside diameter of 1.75 . The conduit with the insulated conductors was placed in another outside conduit an outside tubular that had an outside diameter of 3.5 and an inside diameter of 3.094 . The entire heater assembly was placed in a 6 wellbore in the formation.

The simulation was used to simulate heating of 2000 feet of formation depth target zone below an overburden of 1225 feet. The voltage provided to the heaters was a constant voltage of 4160 V. The formation properties used were for a typical tar sands formation in the Peace River field in Alberta Canada. The heater spacing was 40 feet.

Plot depicts average formation temperature using the heater with the designed heater output of 220 W ft 0.1016 core diameters . Plot depicts average formation temperature using the heater with the designed heater output of 250 W ft 0.1084 core diameters . Plot depicts average formation temperature using the heater with the designed heater output of 280 W ft 0.115 core diameters . Plot depicts the target temperature for the formation of 527 F. As shown by plots and the average formation temperatures increased relatively linearly over time. In addition time to reach the target formation temperature decreased with the higher powered heaters. For the 220 W ft heater the time to reach the target formation temperature was about 1322 days. For the 250 W ft heater the time to reach the target formation temperature was about 1145 days. For the 280 W ft heater the time to reach the target formation temperature was about 1055 days. The simulation shows that heater embodiments shown in have relatively linear heating properties and may be used to heat subsurface formations to desired temperatures.

Non linear analysis was used to calculate power versus temperature curves at three values of currents for a tubular induction heater. The tubular was a 6 Schedule 80 carbon steel tubular. The tubular was used in heater similar to the heater depicted in . depicts plots of power versus temperature at the three currents. Plot depicts power versus temperature for a current of 750 A. Plot depicts power versus temperature for a current of 1000 A. Plot depicts power versus temperature for a current of 1250 A. As shown by the plots in the turndown ratio for the tubular induction heater is relatively sharp. The plots also show the effect of current on the power output for the tubular induction heater.

Simulations were performed for a heater including a vertical insulated conductor in a cylindrical conduit for example the heater depicted in with either air solar salt or tin between the insulated conductor and the conduit. The simulation used a vertical steady state two dimensional axi symmetric system with a temperature boundary condition and a constant power injection rate by the insulated conductor of 300 watts per foot. Values of the temperature boundary condition temperature of the outside surface of the conduit were set at 300 C. 500 C. or 700 C. Air was assumed to be an ideal gas. Some representative properties of the solar salt and the tin are given in Table 2. The software used for the simulations was ANSYS CFX 11. The turbulence model was a shear stress transport model which is an accurate model to solve the heat transfer rate in the near wall region. Table 3 shows the heat transfer modes used for each material.

The simulations were used to examine three different insulated conduit and conduit embodiments. Table 4 shows the sizes of the insulated conductors and conduits used in the simulations.

Having air in the gap between the insulated conductor and the conduit results in the largest temperature difference between the insulated conductor and the conduit for a given boundary condition temperature especially for the lower boundary condition of 300 C. For boundary condition temperatures of 500 C. and 700 C. the temperature difference between the insulated conductor and the conduit for the molten salt and air is significantly reduced because of the increase in radiative heat transfer with increasing temperature.

The temperature of insulated conductor for example at r 0 is lower for curve than for curve . Also the temperature of the molten salt away from the near insulated conductor and near conduit regions is lower for curve than for curves . The Rayleigh number is proportional to x where x is the radial thickness of the fluid. For the large conduit i.e. case 3 and curve the Rayleigh number is about 8 times that of the small conduit i.e. case 2 and curve . The larger Rayleigh number implies that natural convection for the salt in the large conduit is much stronger than the natural convection in the smaller conduit. The stronger natural convection may increase the heat transfer through the molten salt and reduce the temperature of the insulated conductor.

A STARS simulation was used to simulate heating of a tar sands formation using the heater well pattern depicted in . The heaters had a horizontal length in the tar sands formation of 600 m. The heating rate of the heaters was about 750 W m. Production well B depicted in was used at the production well in the simulation. The bottom hole pressure in the horizontal production well was maintained at about 690 kPa. The tar sands formation properties were based on Athabasca tar sands. Input properties for the tar sands formation simulation included initial porosity equals 0.28 initial oil saturation equals 0.8 initial water saturation equals 0.2 initial gas saturation equals 0.0 initial vertical permeability equals 250 millidarcy initial horizontal permeability equals 500 millidarcy initial K Kequals 0.5 hydrocarbon layer thickness equals 28 m depth of hydrocarbon layer equals 587 m initial reservoir pressure equals 3771 kPa distance between production well and lower boundary of hydrocarbon layer equals 2.5 meter distance of topmost heaters and overburden equals 9 meter spacing between heaters equals 9.5 meter initial hydrocarbon layer temperature equals 18.6 C. viscosity at initial temperature equals 53 Pa s 53000 cp and gas to oil ratio GOR in the tar equals 50 standard cubic feet standard barrel. The heaters were constant wattage heaters with a highest temperature of 538 C. at the sand face and a heater power of 755 W m. The heater wells had a diameter of 15.2 cm.

From the STARS simulation the ratio of energy out produced oil and gas energy content versus energy in heater input into the formation was calculated to be about 12 to 1 after about 5 years. The total recovery percentage of oil in place was calculated to be about 60 after about 5 years. Thus producing oil from a tar sands formation using an embodiment of the heater and production well pattern depicted in may produce high oil recoveries and high energy out to energy in ratios.

A STARS simulation was used in combination with experimental analysis to simulate an in situ heat treatment process of a tar sands formation. Heating conditions for the experimental analysis were determined from reservoir simulations. The experimental analysis included heating a cell of tar sands from the formation to a selected temperature and then reducing the pressure of the cell blow down to 100 psig. The process was repeated for several different selected temperatures. While heating the cells formation and fluid properties of the cells were monitored while producing fluids to maintain the pressure below an optimum pressure of 12 MPa before blow down and while producing fluids after blow down although the pressure may have reached higher pressures in some cases the pressure was quickly adjusted and does not affect the results of the experiments . depict results from the simulation and experiments.

As shown in the production volume began to significantly increase as bitumen conversion began at about 270 C. with a significant portion of the oil and barrels of oil equivalent the production volume coming from producing fluids and only some volume coming from the blow down.

An example uses the embodiment depicted in to preheat. Injection wells and production wells are substantially vertical wells. Heaters are long substantially horizontal heaters positioned so that the heaters pass in the vicinity of injection wells . Heaters intersect the vertical well patterns slightly displaced from the vertical wells.

Steam heating for one well pattern for one year is given by BTU pattern year EQN. 10 with Q 500 bbls day 1 yr 365 day yr 1000 BTU lb 350 lbs bbl 63.875 10BTU pattern year.

The actual temperature of the region around a heater is described by an exponential integral function. The integrated form of the exponential integral function shows that about half the energy injected is nearly equal to about half of the injection well temperature. The temperature required to reduce viscosity of the heavy oil is assumed to be 500 F. The volume heated to 500 F. by an electric heater in one year is given by . EQN. 12 

The heat balance is given by . EQN. 13 Thus rcan be solved for and is found to be 10.4 ft. For an electric heater operated at 1000 F. the diameter of a cylinder heated to half that temperature for one year would be about 23 ft. Depending on the permeability profile in the injection wells additional horizontal wells may be stacked above the one at the bottom of the formation and or periods of electric heating may be extended. For a ten year heating period the diameter of the region heated above 500 F. would be about 60 ft.

If all the steam were injected uniformly into the steam injectors over the 100 ft. interval for a period of one year the equivalent volume of formation that could be heated to 500 F. would be give by . EQN. 14 

Solving for rgives an rof 107 ft. This amount of heat would be sufficient to heat about of the pattern to 500 F.

A STARS simulation was used in combination with experimental analysis to simulate an in situ heat treatment process of a tar sands formation. The experiments and simulations were used to determine oil recovery measured by volume percentage vol of oil in place bitumen in place versus API gravity of the produced fluid as affected by pressure in the formation. The experiments and simulations also were used to determine recovery efficiency percentage of oil bitumen recovered versus temperature at different pressures.
