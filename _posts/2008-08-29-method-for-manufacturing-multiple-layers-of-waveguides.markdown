title: Method for manufacturing multiple layers of waveguides
abstract: A method for manufacturing multiple layers of waveguides is disclosed. Initially, a first cladding layer is deposited on a substrate, a first inner cladding layer is then deposited on the first cladding layer, and a first waveguide material is deposited on the first inner cladding layer. The first inner cladding layer and the first waveguide material are then selectively etched to form a first waveguide layer. Next, a second inner cladding layer followed by a second cladding layer are deposited on the first waveguide layer. The second inner cladding layer and the second cladding layer are removed by using a chemical-mechanical polishing process selective to the first waveguide material. A third inner cladding layer followed by a second waveguide material are deposited on the first waveguide material. The third inner cladding layer and the second waveguide material are then selectively etched to form a second waveguide layer. Finally, a fourth inner cladding layer followed by a third cladding layer are deposited on the second waveguide layer.

The present application claims benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. 365 to the previously filed international patent application number PCT US08 074792 filed on Aug. 29 2008 assigned to the assignee of the present application and having a priority date of Oct. 18 2007 based upon U.S. provisional patent application No. 60 999 658 the contents of both applications are incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention was made with United States Government assistance under Contract No. HR0011 05 C 0027 awarded by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA . The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.

The present invention relates to waveguide manufacturing in general and in particular to a method for integrating multiple layers of waveguides having uniform dielectric film thickness surrounding each waveguide.

Theoretically speaking multiple waveguides can be stacked on top of each other with a thick dielectric inserted between each waveguide by using conventional complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS back end of line processing. It is important to have a uniform dielectric around each waveguide within the waveguide stack because transmission power loss can be minimized.

However complications arise when trying to couple all the waveguide layers in a specific location and not in others. The difficulty stems from the lack of good techniques for providing sufficient etch stops and chemical mechanical polish stops. Consequently it would be desirable to provide an improved method for manufacturing multiple layers of waveguides having uniform dielectric film thickness surrounding each of the waveguides.

In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention a first cladding layer is initially deposited on a substrate a first inner cladding layer is then deposited on the first cladding layer and a first waveguide material is deposited on the first inner cladding layer. The first inner cladding layer and the first waveguide material are then selectively etched to form a first waveguide layer. Next a second inner cladding layer followed by a second cladding layer are deposited on the first waveguide layer. The second inner cladding layer and the second cladding layer are removed by using a chemical mechanical polishing process selective to the first waveguide material. A third inner cladding layer followed by a second waveguide material are deposited on the first waveguide material. The third inner cladding layer and the second waveguide material are then selectively etched to form a second waveguide layer. Finally a fourth inner cladding layer followed by a third cladding layer are deposited on the second waveguide layer.

All features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent in the following detailed written description.

Referring now to the drawings and in particular to there are illustrated a method for manufacturing multiple layers of waveguides in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown a thick silicon dioxide layer i.e. a first cladding layer is deposited on a substrate . A silicon nitride layer i.e. a first inner cladding layer is then deposited on silicon dioxide layer . Silicon nitride layer is preferably 25 nm thick. Next a silicon layer is deposited on silicon nitride layer . Silicon layer is preferably 200 nm thick. Conventional etching steps are then performed using photo resist to selectively etch silicon nitride layer and silicon layer to form a structure as shown in

A second silicon nitride layer i.e. a second inner cladding layer is then deposited on the structure of after which a second thick silicon dioxide layer i.e. a second cladding layer is deposited as depicted in . Silicon nitride layer is preferably 25 nm.

Next second silicon nitride layer and second silicon dioxide layer are polished back using a conventional chemical mechanical polishing CMP process that is selective to silicon layer to form a structure as shown in

A third silicon nitride layer i.e. a third inner cladding layer is deposited on the structure of after which a second silicon layer is deposited as depicted in

Conventional etching process is then utilized to etch second silicon layer along with third silicon nitride layer as etch stop between waveguides as shown in . Third silicon nitride layer is then removed to ensure uniform final silicon nitride thickness around waveguides.

A fourth silicon nitride layer i.e. a fourth inner cladding layer is deposited on the structure of after which a third thick silicon dioxide layer is deposited on fourth silicon nitride layer as depicted on . As a result a second waveguide formed by second silicon layer is stacked on top of a first waveguide formed by silicon layer .

With reference now to there are illustrated a method for manufacturing multiple layers of waveguides in accordance with an alternative embodiment of the present invention. As shown a thick silicon dioxide layer is initially deposited on a substrate . Conventional etching process using photo resist is then applied to etch a trench in silicon dioxide layer . After removing the photo resist a silicon nitride layer is deposited and after which a silicon layer is deposited as shown in

Silicon nitride layer and silicon layer are polished back selective to silicon dioxide layer using CMP. A second silicon nitride layer is then deposited after which a second silicon dioxide layer is deposited on silicon nitride layer . Conventional etching process using photo resist is utilized to etch a trench in second silicon dioxide layer and second silicon nitride layer to form a structure as depicted in

A third silicon nitride layer is applied and a second silicon layer is then deposited on third silicon nitride layer as shown in

Third silicon nitride layer and second silicon layer are polished back selective to silicon dioxide layer using CMP. A fourth silicon nitride layer is then deposited. A third silicon dioxide layer is then deposited on fourth silicon nitride layer as depicted in . As a result a second waveguide formed by silicon layer is stacked on top of a first waveguide formed by silicon layer .

As has been described the present invention provides an improved method for manufacturing multiple layers of waveguides having uniform dielectric film thickness surrounding each of the waveguides. The present invention does not simply allow for stacking waveguides with dielectrics in between but it also allows waveguides to be stacked with dual cladding layers where the thickness of the inner cladding layer is uniform all the way around the waveguide.

While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
