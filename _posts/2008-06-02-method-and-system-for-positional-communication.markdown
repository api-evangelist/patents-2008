A user may amass a number of electronic communications from a number of different users. The user may seek to view and or respond to particular electronic communications.

Example methods and systems for positional communication are described. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of example embodiments. It will be evident however to one skilled in the art that embodiments of the present invention may be practiced without these specific details.

In an example embodiment a plurality of electronic communications for a user may be accessed. Positional information associated with the user may be accessed. User interface data for the plurality of electronic communications may be provided based on the positional information.

The network over which the client machine and the provider are in communication may include a Global System for Mobile Communications GSM network an Internet Protocol IP network a Wireless Application Protocol WAP network a WiFi network or a IEEE 802.11 standards network as well as various combinations thereof. Other conventional and or later developed wired and wireless networks may also be used.

The provider may manage the electronic communications on behalf of a user. The provider may also manage the electronic communications of one or more additional users. However other providers not associated with the user of the client machine may manage electronic communications of additional users. Examples of providers include MICROSOFT YAHOO and GOOGLE.

An interfacing subsystem may be deployed within the client machine and or the provider to enable providing of user interface data for the electronic communications of the user. The interfacing subsystem may be used to provide user interface data based on positional information.

The provider may also be in communication with a database . The database may include user data include information regarding users of the provider .

A positioning provider may be in communication with to obtain positional information. Examples of positioning providers include portable GPS devices mobile phones and the like. The positioning provider may be made integral with the client machine and or the provider .

The communication access module accesses electronic communications for a user. The electronic communications may include mail messages instant messages electronic facsimiles or the like. The positional information may be received from the user. A positioning request may be provided to the positioning provider and the positional information may be received from the positioning provider .

The positional information access module accesses positional information associated with the user. The positional information may include GPS data GPRS data wave point data and or triangulation data. Other positional information may also be used.

In an example embodiment the machine operates as a standalone device or may be connected e.g. networked to other machines. In a networked deployment the machine may operate in the capacity of a server or a client machine in server client network environment or as a peer machine in a peer to peer or distributed network environment. The machine may be a server computer a client computer a personal computer PC a tablet PC a set top box STB a Personal Digital Assistant PDA a cellular telephone a web appliance a network router switch or bridge or any machine capable of executing a set of instructions sequential or otherwise that specify actions to be taken by that machine. Further while only a single machine is illustrated the term machine shall also be taken to include any collection of machines that individually or jointly execute a set or multiple sets of instructions to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed herein.

The example computer system includes a processor e.g. a central processing unit CPU a graphics processing unit GPU or both a main memory and a static memory which communicate with each other via a bus . The computer system may further include a video display unit e.g. a liquid crystal display LCD or a cathode ray tube CRT . The computer system also includes an alphanumeric input device e.g. a keyboard a cursor control device e.g. a mouse a drive unit a signal generation device e.g. a speaker and a network interface device .

The drive unit includes a machine readable medium on which is stored one or more sets of instructions e.g. software embodying any one or more of the methodologies or functions described herein. The software may also reside completely or at least partially within the main memory and or within the processor during execution thereof by the computer system the main memory and the processor also constituting machine readable media.

The software may further be transmitted or received over a network via the network interface device .

While the machine readable medium is shown in an example embodiment to be a single medium the term machine readable medium should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media e.g. a centralized or distributed database and or associated caches and servers that store the one or more sets of instructions. The term machine readable medium shall also be taken to include any medium that is capable of storing encoding or carrying a set of instructions for execution by the machine and that cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the embodiments of the present invention. The term machine readable medium shall accordingly be taken to include but not be limited to solid state memories optical and magnetic media and carrier wave signals.

Certain systems apparatus applications or processes are described herein as including a number of modules or mechanisms. A module or a mechanism may be a unit of distinct functionality that can provide information to and receive information from other modules. Accordingly the described modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Modules may also initiate communication with input or output devices and can operate on a resource e.g. a collection of information . The modules be implemented as hardware circuitry optical components single or multi processor circuits memory circuits software program modules and objects firmware and combinations thereof as appropriate for particular implementations of various embodiments.

Thus methods and systems for positional communication have been described. Although the present invention has been described with reference to specific example embodiments it will be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly the specification and drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.
