This invention comprises compounds which inhibit the activity of poly ADP ribose polymerase PARP compositions containing the compounds and methods of treating diseases using them.

Poly ADP ribose polymerase PARP has an essential role in facilitating DNA repair controlling RNA transcription mediating cell death and regulating immune response. PARP inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in disease models for allergic encephalitis arthritis cardiac and kidney toxicities from doxorubicin based and platinum based antineoplastic agents carcinoma of the breast central nervous system inflammation cervical carcinoma colon cancer diabetes and complications therefrom glioblastoma gout hemmorhagic shock hypoglycemia inflammatory bowel disease ischemia reperfusion injury associated with myocardial infarction kidney disease leukemia liver toxicity following acetominophen overdose lymphoma melanoma multiple sclerosis myocardial infarction neural trauma organ transplantation Parkinsons disease potentiation of cytotoxic cancer therapy pulmonary fibrosis reperfusion of the eye gut kidney and skeletal muscle retroviral infection rheumatoid arthritis sepsis septic shock skin damage secondary to sulfur mustards stroke and other neural trauma and uveitis.

In cancer models PARP inhibitors have been shown to potentiate radiation and chemotherapy by increasing apoptosis of cancer cells limiting tumor growth decreasing metastasis and prolonging the survival of tumor bearing animals. There is therefore an existing need in the therapeutic arts for PARP inhibitors.

To a suspension of EXAMPLE 51D 70 mg 0.236 mmol in N N dimethylformamide 6 mL was added acetic acid 0.014 mL 0.236 mmol and 2 chloro 1 3 dimethylimidazolinium chloride 84 mg 0.496 mmol . After 15 minutes triethylamine 0.165 mL 1.181 mmol was added dropwise. The reaction was stirred for 5 hours. Water was added to the suspension and the solid was filtered. The filtrate was concentrated and purified by HPLC Zorbax C 18 250 2.54 column Mobile phase A 0.1 trifluoroacetic acid in HO B 0.1 trifluoroacetic acid in CHCN 0 100 gradient to provide the title compound as trifluoroacetic acid salt.
