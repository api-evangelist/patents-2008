This application claims the priority of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60 917 358 filed May 11 2007 and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

This invention is made partially with U.S. Government support from the Army Research Office under a contract No. W911NF 06 C 0014. The U.S. Government has certain rights in the invention.

This invention relates generally to Bio electronics and more particularly to DNA based electronic devices such as diodes and photodetectors.

As the miniaturization of silicon based electronic devices continues to approach physical technical and economic limits the electronics industry faces the new challenge of identifying materials that can replace silicon to overcome these limits making much denser and ultra miniaturized electronic devices. DNA is a promising candidate material drawing widespread interest in studies of its electrical properties particularly as to whether it is a conductive wire a semiconductor an insulator or even a superconductor. Through an improved understanding of DNA electrical properties DNA based electronics could form the basis for molecular scale electronics extending well beyond the silicon based electronics limitations.

DNA the building block of life has been the center of biological research and industries for five decades. Just after the famous DNA double helix structure was discovered scientists found that DNA was semi conductive. In the past few years the observation of DNA s conductivity properties brought renewed attention in the search for new materials for next generation nano technologies and microelectronics. The question surfaced as to whether DNA could be also the building block for molecular electronics and play a pivotal role in the future of modern electronics. More recently the interests in the DNA conductivity have been greatly increased and more investigations have been carried out. However the results are confusing and contradictory so far showing that the DNA conductivity could be an insulator semiconductor conductor or a proximate induced superconductor.

In one embodiment a semiconductor device comprises a metal contact a DNA layer wherein the metal layer and the DNA layer are adapted to form a Schottky barrier junction there between and a conductive contact with the DNA layer. The metal contact may include gold aluminum copper or chromium or other metals. The DNA layer may include salmon sperm DNA. The DNA layer may be either n or p type semiconductor by doping. The n or p type DNA semiconductor materials could form p n junction in making new DNA based semiconductor devices. The conductive contact may be adapted to allow light energy to pass to the DNA layer. The conductive contact may be coated with indium tin oxide.

In another embodiment a photodiode comprises a metal contact a DNA layer wherein the metal layer and the DNA layer are adapted to form a Schottky barrier junction there between and a conductive contact with the DNA layer. The metal contact may include gold aluminum copper or chromium. The DNA layer may include salmon sperm DNA.

The invention relates to native DNA based Schottky diodes made by metal DNA contacts. The novel Schottky diodes demonstrate excellent current voltage characteristics with low forward threshold voltage and adequately large reverse breakdown voltage needed for a practical range in low voltage operation. In addition there are observed and demonstrated photoelectric effects PE in DNA Gold Schottky diodes. Based on carefully controlled PE measurements the DNA Gold Schottky barrier height is measured in one embodiment measured as 1.52 eV.

The invention described herein also relates to photoelectric effects under visible and near infrared illumination and diode type rectifying current voltage I V characteristics in DNA metal contact devices. These devices are constructed with DNA film sandwiched between gold and transparent conductive indium tin oxide ITO electrodes. Other metals such as aluminum chromium and copper may also be used. In the embodiments described herein DNA is used to make Schottky diodes through carefully formed contact with metals.

Prior to continuing the detailed description of the invention a paper co authored by the inventor De Yu Zang Proceedings SPIE Vol. 6470 8 Feb. 2007 Photoelectrical effect and current voltage characteristics in DNA metal Schottky barriers is incorporated herein by reference.

Nonmetal metal contact is generally not ohmic. In such a non ohmic contact the current response to the applied voltage is normally not linear. If the nonmetal material is a semiconductor its contact with a metal could form a Schottky barrier if the interfaces are pure and clean. The Schottky barrier is a potential barrier arising from stable space charges in the semiconductor alone without the presence of a chemical layer.

The DNA metal device of B and C includes three layers top gold layer electrode a bottom electrode coated with ITO and a thin DNA film which is sandwiched between the two electrodes . In a preferred embodiment the thickness of the gold electrode is 1000 and the thickness of the ITO coated electrode is 700 . The thickness of DNA film is 13 19 m. The DNA film is generally shining and smooth with a uniformity of 10 typically in the device working area. The DNA metal electrode area which defines the device working area is 0.691 cm.

Any suitable DNA may be used. In the preferred embodiment a Salmon sperm based DNA with a molecule weight of 8 10 kbps having a purity is 94 95 b De ionic water with resistance greater than 18 M and pH value of 8.0 and c gold with purity greater than 99.99 . Chromium aluminum and copper may alternatively be used provided that the purity is also greater than 99.99 .

In fabrication the DNA is completely dissolved into de ionized water with a weight ratio of 1 100. The DNA water solution is filtered with a 1.2 m filter and then is cast on a 1 1 ITO coated glass substrate. The sample is immediately placed into an oven to dry. As soon as the DNA film is dried completely the sample is transported into a sputtering machine to deposit a patterned thin gold layer on the DNA film as the top electrode . Finally the top and bottom electrodes are connected with electric wires.

To improve the sensitivity of photoelectrical effect the device is mostly treated under an electric poling process in an attempt to align DNA molecules along the electric field and create DNA permanent dipoles. The method of the electric poling is as follows. The device is placed in a nitrogen environment and an electric field is applied. The device is heated and allowed to cool down to room temperature. The electric field strength is monitored by measuring the electric current through the device. After electric poling the device is stored at room temperature for at least one week for discharging before any measurements.

The metal sputtering processing in the fabrication is important to form the DNA metal Schottky barriers. During the sputtering deposition the metal ions in the plasma beams bombard the soft DNA surface and eventually clean it of any contamination accumulated in prior preparations. The thin metal layer is then intimately contacted with the clean DNA surface forming a Schottky barrier.

As a voltage is applied on ITO electrode and the gold electrode a current is generated in the circuit. If the voltage is plus on the ITO electrode which is commonly called a forward bias the current is increased exponentially as the voltage is increased beyond a certain value threshold voltage . However if the voltage applied on the ITO electrode is negative which is commonly called reverse bias the current is quite limited as the voltage is increased not exceed to a certain value the so called breakdown voltage .

The reason for such rectifying I V characteristics is that the forward bias reduces the Schottky barrier allowing the electrons to more easily to overcome the barrier whereas the reverse bias increases the barrier making the electron flow more difficult.

The DNA Schottky diodes showed excellent current voltage characteristics with low forward threshold voltage and sufficiently large reverse breakdown voltage essential to allow useful and wide ranging applications.

Transient current spikes at and occur when input light is switched on and then later switched off . The current characteristics are described in the five time spans shown and which are Region A before light on Region B immediately after light on Region C is during continued illumination Region D immediately after Light Off and Region E beyond signal relaxation after Light Off .

Although the invention has been described with respect to various embodiments it should be realized this invention is also capable of a wide variety of further and other embodiments.
