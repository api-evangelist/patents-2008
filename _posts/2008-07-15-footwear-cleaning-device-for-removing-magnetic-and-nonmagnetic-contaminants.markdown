This invention was made with Government support under Contract No N00024 03 C 5115 awarded by the Department of the Navy. The Government has certain rights in this invention.

The present invention relates to footwear cleaning devices and more particularly to a footwear cleaning device for removing magnetic and non magnetic contaminants.

Abrasives grindings metal chips and other contaminant particles are common during the construction of ships. Such contaminant particles when accumulated on the ship can damage the ship s equipment.

These contaminant particles are transferred to all areas of the ship by foot traffic. Cleaning the contaminant particles admitted to an area sensitive thereto is time consuming and costly. If the footwear is cleaned prior to entering the area clean up requirements are reduced.

A common solution for preventing contamination transfer to these areas is a footwear cleaning mat. Such mats however do not effectively remove the contaminant particles particularly metallic particles from the footwear and the removed contaminant particles are not effectively transported away from the cleaning surfaces of the mat.

Accordingly a device is needed for removing metallic non metallic and other contaminant particles from footwear.

A device for removing metallic and other contaminant particles accumulated on footwear comprises in one embodiment a housing and a grid of cleaning rods supported by the housing. The grid of cleaning rods includes at least one rod capable of generating a magnetic field which removes the metallic contaminant particles from the footwear.

In another embodiment the device further comprises a first motor for rotating the at least one rod capable of generating a magnetic field rotates a selected speed.

In still another embodiment the grid of cleaning rods further includes at least one rod with brushing elements.

In yet another embodiment the at least one rod with brushing elements is rotated by the first motor or by a second motor.

In still a further embodiment the device further comprises a vibrating motor for vibrating the at least one vibrating rod.

In yet still a further embodiment the device further comprises a receptacle disposed below the grid of cleaning rods for collecting the contaminant particles removed from the footwear by one or more of the rods.

In an alternate embodiment the at least one rod capable of generating a magnetic field includes one or more magnetic elements.

The main housing may be made from any suitable material including but not limited to metals and plastics which is capable of securely supporting adults of various weights.

Referring again to an opening is provided in the top wall of the main housing . Disposed within the opening of the main housing above the drawer is a grid of cleaning rods . The grid of cleaning rods extend between the vertical side walls of the main housing . A fixed tread is disposed between each pair of cleaning rods and next to the cleaning rods at each end of the grid. The fixed treads extend between the vertical side walls of the main housing parallel with the cleaning rods . The grid of cleaning rods includes rotating rods . Alternatively in a second embodiment shown in where like elements are identified by like reference characters the device has a grid of cleaning rods that includes rotating rods and non rotating rods .

Referring to a gap is provided between each pair of rods in the grid below the fixed tread to allow the contaminant particles removed by the rods to fall through the grid and onto the base wall of the drawer . To ensure that the contaminant particles fall through the gaps in the grid and do not remain on the rotating rods the fixed rods are each provided with brushing elements that brush the contaminants off the rotating rods as they rotate.

The rotating rods rotate in bearing or bushing elements not shown that are disposed in the vertical side walls of the main housing . In the second embodiment of the rotating rods and non rotating rods may be alternately disposed within the grid . In another embodiment pairs of rotating rods and pairs of non rotating rods may be alternately disposed within the grid.

In one embodiment the cleaning rods may have a round cross sectional shape. Cleaning rods having other suitable cross sectional shapes or a mix of shapes may also be used. The cleaning rods may be made from any suitable material including but not limited to metals and plastics which is capable of securely supporting adults of various weights.

Some of the rotating rods include brushing elements and some of the rotating rods include magnetic elements . In alternate embodiments the rotating rods may include both brushing elements and magnetic elements . In other embodiments the rotating rods may be magnetic rotating rods and therefore do not include magnetic elements. In the first embodiment of some of the rotating rods include brushing elements some of the rotating rods include magnetic elements some of the rotating rods include both brushing elements and magnetic elements and some of the rotating rods are magnetic rotating rods .

The rotating rods with the brushing elements brush contaminant particles off the footwear. The magnetic rotating rods or the rotating rods with the magnetic elements magnetically attract and remove metallic contaminant particles from the footwear.

In the first embodiment the rotating rods are rotated by a single electric motor at a selected speed via a gear reduction unit and an arrangement of belts and pulleys . In other embodiments a gear drive and or chain spocket arrangement may be used in place of or in combination a belt and pulley arrangement. A weight is eccentrically mounted to the electric motor for causing the rotating rods to vibrate at a selected frequency and amplitude.

In the second embodiment each rotating rod is rotated at a selected speed by a corresponding electric motor . The frequency and amplitude of vibration is selected to loosen contaminant particles stuck to the footwear so that the particles may fall through the gaps between the rotating rods and or be brushed off the footwear by the rotating rods with the brushing elements and or fall off and attach to the magnetic rotating rods or the magnetic elements of the rotating rods .

Referring again to the device of each non rotating rod may be connected to a vibratory electric motor which causes the non rotating rod to vibrate at a selected frequency and amplitude. Alternatively the non rotating rods may be connected to a single vibratory electric motor via a gear drive belt and or chain arrangement not shown which causes all the non rotating rods to vibrate at a selected frequency and amplitude. The frequency and amplitude of vibration is selected to loosen contaminant particles stuck to the footwear so that the particles may fall through the gaps between the cleaning rods and or be brushed off the footwear by the rotating rods with the brushing elements and or fall off attach to the magnetic rotating rods .

In one exemplary embodiment a foot or hand actuated on off switch for activating the motors of the footwear cleaning device is conveniently disposed on the outer surface of the main housing . In an alternative exemplary embodiment a sensor for sensing the placement of a user s foot or feet on the grid of cleaning rods is provided for automatically activating and deactivating the motors of the device . The sensor may be an electronic eye disposed on as shown or otherwise operatively associated with the footwear cleaning device or a weight sensor operatively associated with the device .

In operation a user places one or both feet on the grid of cleaning rods . The vibrating rods loosen contaminant particles stuck to the footwear so that the particles fall through the gaps between the cleaning rods . Any particles that remain attached to the footwear are brushed off the footwear by the brushing elements of the rotating rods and directed toward the gaps . Metallic contaminant particles attached to the footwear may be removed by the magnetic field generated by the rotating magnetic rods or the rotating rods with the magnetic elements .

The drawer collects any contaminant particles that falls through the gaps between the rods during footwear cleaning. The drawer may be emptied by removing the drawer from the main housing of the device and emptying the drawer . The drawer may then be reinstalled into the main housing .
