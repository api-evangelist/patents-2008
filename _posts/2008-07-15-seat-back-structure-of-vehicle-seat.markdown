The present invention relates to a seat back structure of vehicle seat provided with a movable headrest. In particular the invention is directed to a seat back structure of vehicle seat of the type comprising a headrest movably provided on the seat back and a pressure receiving element provided in the seat back and operatively connected with the headrest with the arrangement thereof being such that when a rear end collision occurs and a backward load is applied from a seat occupant to the pressure receiving element under a backward inertia of that seat occupant the headrest is forcibly displaced forwardly and upwardly toward a point adjacent to a head of the seat occupant.

Disclosed and known for example from the Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 11 34708 is a seat back structure of the foregoing kind which is designed for protecting a seat occupant s head against a rear end collision. In brief in the case of rear end collision the body of seat occupant is naturally displaced backwardly of the seat under a backward initial of the seat occupant which in turn applies a corresponding load or impact load to a given pressure receiving element provided in the seat back. At this moment with that pressure receiving element being moved backwardly a headrest is forcibly at once displaced forwardly and upwardly to a point adjacent to a head of the seat occupant.

According to this kind of emergency active headrest a biasing means or a tension spring for example is provided between the pressure receiving element and the headrest. Normally the headrest is biasingly retained by such biasing means toward a lower home position where it receives a head of seat occupant in an ordinary manner. The biasing means in this headrest system or the tension spring for example has a predetermined biasing force sufficient to withstand a weight of the seat occupant s upper body portion as well as a normal load applied from that upper body portion unless an impact load is applied thereto in a rear end collision case by a greater force than the seat occupant s upper body portion weight and the normal load. Hence only when such great impact load is applied to the seat back the pressure receiving element is moved backwardly against the biasing force of the tension spring so that the headrest is displaced from the lower headrest home position in forward and upward directions towards a predetermined upwardly displaced point of headrest.

With such arrangement when the rear end collision occurs the headrest is quickly displaced toward a head of seat occupant being concurrently displaced forwardly thereby insuring to keep a smallest possible space between the seat occupants head and headrest and therefore it is possible to effectively reduce a degree of subsequent backward inclination of the seat occupant s head wherein such subsequent backward inclination of seat occupant s head is quickly followed by forward displacement of that particular head under a backward inertia of the seat occupant as is known. Accordingly in this prior art an abrupt backward inclination of the seat occupant s head can be prevented assuredly and it is possible to minimize injury of his or her neck portion or whiplash injury.

In the above described known headrest system the pressure receiving element adapted for receiving an impact load caused by backward inertia of the seat occupant as stated above is disposed at a point corresponding to a dorsal part of the seat occupant.

In general when a seat occupant assumes normal seating posture on a seat his or her lumbar part is in a substantially full contact with the surface of seat back while by contrast his or her dorsal part is in most cases positioned away from the seat back a certain distance. Thus under a backward inertia of the seat occupant in the case of actual rear end collision the dorsal part of the seat occupant has to move backwards a distance corresponding to the afore said certain distance between the seat back and that particular seat occupant s dorsal part and then reach the pressure receiving element at which moment the pressure receiving element is pressed by that backwardly moved seat occupant s dorsal part and forcibly moved backwardly to cause forward and upward displacement of the headrest. This means that upon occurrence of the rear end collision the seat occupant s dorsal part is moved backwardly the aforementioned distance and struck against the pressure receiving element. Consequently it is more likely than not that the seat occupant s dorsal part might be suffered from or damaged by an excessive impact due to its being strongly struck against the pressure receiving portion which leaves a problem in this kind of active headrest system.

An example of solution to this problem is found in the Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No 2000 325179 which teaches such head protection arrangement that in a rear end collision case upon a seat occupant s lumbar part being pressed against a pressure receiving element a headrest is immediately displaced upwardly to receive a head of the occupant.

This prior art arrangement is indeed effective in view of the foregoing statement that the seat occupant s lumbar part is in a substantially full contact with the surface of seat back at the time when the seat occupant assumes normal seating posture on a seat. In other words in the case of rear end collision such arrangement does not require undesired long moving distance of the lumbar part towards the pressure receiving element in the seat back but permits that lumbar part to quickly reach and push the pressure receiving element. Hence this lumbar active type of head projection system insures to lessen an impact applied from the pressure receiving element to the seat occupant s lumbar part.

In this sort of head protection system a biasing means is provided to give a predetermined biasing force to both of the headrest and pressure receiving element and generally stated the biasing force is always imposed and active on all operative elements which are to be moved with every movement of the headrest including that particular pressure receiving element and headrest. Consequently in the rear end collision case it is necessary that a pressure overcoming such biasing force be continuously applied from the seat occupant s lumbar part to the pressure receiving element in order to cause upward displacement of the headrest to a given point for receiving seat occupant s head and also stably retain the headrest at that given point. However the problem is that in most of seat back used in this kind of seat the upper region thereof for supporting the dorsal part of seat occupant is more elastic and cushiony than the lower region thereof for supporting the lumbar part of seat occupant and therefore the dorsal part of seat occupant will be more deeply sunk backwards into the upper region of seat back than his or her lumbar part. In that instance the seat occupant s seating posture is naturally changed to shift his or her weight in a direction from the lumbar part to the dorsal part which will possibly reduce the degree of load applied to the pressure receiving element from the seat occupant s lumber part. Hence as far as the present prior art relies only on a pressure from the seat occupant s lumbar part to the pressure receiving element it is likely that if that pressure is lower than a predetermine degree the headrest will not reach the foregoing given point for supporting seat occupant s head and will not be retained at that point for safety purpose neither.

Consequently for the foregoing conventional seat back structure it is possible that an excessive impact will be caused in the dorsal part of seat occupant at the time of commencement of the pressure receiving element to receive that dorsal part and further the seat occupant s lumar part will not sufficiently be pressed against the pressure receiving element with the result that the pressure receiving element will not be moved enough to cause the headrest to displace to the point for supporting the seat occupant s head.

In view of the above stated drawbacks it is a primary purpose of the present invention to provide an improved seat back structure of vehicle seat with headrest which avoids an excessive impact to the dorsal part of seat occupant in the case of rear end collision at the time of commencement of pressure receiving portion to receive the seat occupant s dorsal part and also insures to cause continued displacement of the headrest to an upwardly displaced point by a load applied from the lumbar part of seat occupant.

In order to achieve such purpose there is basically provided a structure of seat back of vehicle seat in combination with a headrest wherein the headrest has at least one stay portion and is displaceable between a home position where the headrest normally supports a head of a seat occupant on the vehicle seat and an upwardly displaced point to which the headrest is to be displaced upwardly from said home position 

Preferably the foregoing pressure receiving element may be formed by bending a rod material into a substantially U shaped configuration having defined therein a pair of vertical rod sections each having an upper free end portion and a lower end and a cross rod section integrally extended between the lower end of one of the pair of vertical rod sections and the lower end of another of the pair of vertical rod sections wherein the pair of vertical rod sections correspond to the second pressure receiving region and the cross rod section corresponds to the first pressure receiving region and wherein the respective two upper free end portions of the pair of vertical rod sections are connected with the support shaft.

As one aspect of the present invention a pair of actuator link elements of stretchable and contractible type may be provided in the above described seat back structure. Namely each of the two actuator link elements is formed from a rigid material and having one end portion and another end portion and disposed within the seat back frame such that one of the pair of actuator link elements extends inwardly of and alongside of one of the pair of lateral frame members whereas another of the pair of actuator link elements extends inwardly of and alongside of another of the pair of lateral frame members. The aforesaid one of the pair of actuator link elements is pivotally connected at one end thereof with the afore said one of the pair of lateral frame members while being pivotally connected at another end thereof with the second end portion of such one of the pair of rotating links. On the other hand the afore said another of said pair of actuator link elements is pivotally connected at one end thereof with the foregoing another of said pair of lateral frame members while being pivotally connected at another end thereof with the second end portion of such another of said pair of rotating links. The crank element is disposed rotatably connected between the pair of actuator link elements as to be rotatable in a direction backwardly and upwardly of the seat back frame the crank element being movably connected with the pressure receiving element.

Other various features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from reading of the descriptions hereinafter with reference to the accompanied drawings.

Referring to there are illustrated a first exemplary embodiment and a second alternative exemplary embodiment with regard to a seat back structure of vehicle seat in accordance with the preset invention. It is noted that the vehicle seat itself is not shown in the drawings which comprises a seat back to be elaborated hereinafter and an unshown seat cushion but it should be understood that a seat occupant not shown is to sit on the vehicle seat and rest his or her lumbar and dorsal parts on the seat back .

As shown the seat back is provided with an headrest of an emergency active type workable in rear end collision case wherein when a rear end collision occurs in response to a backward great pressure applied from a seat occupant on the vehicle seat under a backward inertia of the seat occupant the headrest will be immediately displaced upwardly from a lower home point indicated by the one dot chained lines to a given point where the headrest assumes forwardly inclined state.

Designation denotes a seat back frame provided in the seat back . The seat back frame includes a generally inverted U shaped upper frame member a pair of lateral frame members and a headrest support frame member .

The headrest support frame member has a downwardly sloped plate region which extends forwardly aslant therefrom and also extends in a direction transversely of the two lateral frame members and that each of the two lateral frame members extends downwardly from the upper frame member .

It is noted that the wording forward or forwardly refers to a side FW forwardly of the seat back or vehicle seat not shown and the wording backward or backwardly refers to a side RW backwardly the seat back or vehicle seat.

Reference is first made to which shows a first mode of the seat back structure in accordance with the present invention.

As seen in the a left rotating link is pivotally connected via a pin with a connecting bracket fixed to an upper region of left lateral frame member of the seat back frame Likewise while not shown clearly it is to be understood that another right rotating link identical to that left rotating link is pivotally connected via a pin with another connecting bracket fixed to an upper region of right side lateral frame member .

As best shown in each of the two rotating links is so formed to comprise a pivotal region which is pivotally connected via the pin with the bracket and faces to the forward side FW a first connecting region defined distant from the pivotal region in a direction to the backward side RW a second connecting region defined forwardly and downwardly of the first connecting region and a third connecting region which is defined distant from the pivotal region in a direction to the backward side RW and above the first connecting region .

As shown one end of a support shaft is rotatably connected with the foregoing first connecting region of left side rotating link and another end of the support shaft is rotatably connected with a first connecting region at of another right side rotating link . Hence the support shaft is rotatably journalled between the two rotating links so as to be rotatively displaceable upwardly and downwardly along an arcuate path relative to the pin as understandable from .

Firmly connected at its lower end with the support shaft is a holder bracket in which a stay of headrest is inserted and retained thereby supportively connecting the headrest with the seat back . A guide element is securely engaged in the downwardly inclined region of the seat back frame upper member . In brief the guide element is so adapted that the holder bracket is slidably inserted therethrough at a certain angle with the seat back that is set in the shown upright state when the seat back is in a normal use and that on the other hand upon rotation of the rotating link in the case of rear end collision case the holder bracket is to be displaced upwardly while being inclined forwardly with respect to the guide element as understandable from .

As seen in the holder bracket is of a generally dogleg shape as viewed from its lateral side and has an upper rectilinear portion and a lower sloped portion such that the latter extends in a downwardly and forwardly slant direction from the former . This holder bracket is of a generally rectangular shape in cross section having a hollow therein and a stay of the headrest is inserted in the inside of that holder bracket via a stay holder and received supportively therein.

The stay holder is securely attached in the end region of the upper rectilinear portion of the holder bracket at a given position by a lock mechanism not shown in the vertical direction thereof. The structure of the stay holder is not the subject matter of the present invention and thus a further detailed description thereon is omitted.

As illustrated the upper rectilinear portion of the foregoing holder bracket passes through a through hole of the guide element and is disposed therein.

As will be elaborated later the holder bracket is displaceable vertically through the guide element while changing its inclination angle between a lower headrest home position and an upwardly displaced point of headrest. Namely in brief as far as the illustrative embodiment is concerned as understandable from when the holder bracket is in the shown position where the upper rectilinear portion thereof is inclined backwardly at a first given angle relative to the downwardly sloped plate region of upper frame portion the headrest is set at a normal home position as indicated by LOWER HEADREST HOME POSITION. On the other hand as understandable from in the case of rear end collision when the headrest is displaced upwardly from the lower home position as indicated by UPWARDLY DISPLACED POINT OF HEADREST the holder bracket is in the shown position where the upper rectilinear portion thereof is inclined forwardly at a second given angle relative to the downwardly sloped plate region . Hereinafter for the sake of simplicity the wording LOWER HEADREST HOME POSITION shall be referred to as lower headrest home position or lower home position whereas the wording UPWARDLY DISPLACED POINT OF HEADREST be referred to as upwardly displaced point of headrest or upwardly displaced point .

In the illustrative embodiment the guide element itself is securely provided in the downwardly sloped plate region of seat back frame upper portion and in view thereof the two first support surfaces are both sloped with respect to the downwardly sloped plate region so as to provide an angle of inclination thereof equal to the aforementioned first given angle whereas the two second support surfaces are substantially perpendicular with the sloped plate region so as to provide an angle of inclination thereof equal to the aforementioned second given angle. Hence when the headrest is set in the above noted lower headrest home position the pair of first support surfaces are in a close contact with the respective two opposite lateral surfaces of the holder bracket upper rectilinear portion thereby positively supporting the holder bracket as indicated by the one dot chain lines in . On the other hand when the headrest is displaced to and positioned at the above noted upwardly displaced point of headrest the pair of second support surfaces are in a close contact with the respective two opposite lateral surfaces of holder bracket upper rectilinear portion thereby positively supporting the holder bracket as indicated by the two dot chain lines in .

Designations in and denote a pair of securing hook parts formed integrally with the guide element so as to have a resilient property. In this respect the guide element comprises upper and lower portions and and a shoulder region defined peripherally thereof between those upper and lower portions . The two securing hook parts are formed in the upper portion so as to be spaced from the shoulder region a distance substantially equal to a thickness of the downwardly sloped plate region . While not clearly shown formed in the downwardly sloped plate region is a bearing hole in which each guide element is secured and from the drawings any person skilled in the art will readily understand that the peripheral edge of such bearing hole in the sloped plate region is sandwiched between the two securing hook parts and shoulder region and therefore the guide element is securely attached in that particular sloped plate region .

As constructed above the support shaft is supported by the two rotating links in a vertically movable manner and therefore as both two rotating links are rotated the support shaft is simultaneously displaced in vertical direction to thereby cause the headrest to displace in the likewise vertical direction towards one of the previously stated lower home position and upwardly displaced point. More specifically with rotation of the two rotating links relative to the pivot pin the support shaft located backwardly of that pivot pin is subjected to either downward and forward displacement or upward and backward displacement along an arcuate path relative to a central axis of the pivot pin . That is clockwise rotation of rotating link causes downward and forward displacement of the support shaft relative to the pin whereas anticlockwise rotation of rotating link causes upward and backward displacement of the support shaft relative to the pin . Hence it follows that with the afore said downward and forward displacement of support shaft the headrest is displaced downwardly while being inclined backwardly relative to the guide element whereas with the afore said upward and backward displacement of support shaft the headrest is displaced upwardly while being inclined forwardly relative to the guide element see .

In the present embodiment as can be seen in a stopper piece is formed integrally with the connecting bracket so as to project therefrom inwardly of the seat back frame lateral frame member to limit clockwise rotation of the rotating link so that the headrest is assuredly prevented against any further displacement beyond the lower headrest home position.

A pair of biasing means and are provided for giving biasing force to the respective two rotating links so as to biasingly retain the headrest at the lower headrest home position. In the present embodiment the two biasing means are each embodied by an extension coil spring. As illustrated one extension coil spring may be at the upper end thereof securely engaged with the third connecting region of the left side rotating link at a point above the support shaft while being at the lower end thereof securely engaged in the connecting hole formed in the lower region of the left side lateral frame member of seat back frame . Likewise as understandable by the dotted line in as well as the foregoing spring the other extension coil spring may be at the upper end thereof securely engaged with a third connecting region of another right side rotating link at a point above the support shaft while being at the lower end thereof securely engaged in a connecting hole formed in the lower region of another right side lateral frame member . With such construction a biasing force is always given from the extension coil springs to the rotating links thereby biasingly retaining the headrest at the lower home position.

It is noted that a total biasing force of both two biasing means or two extension coil springs is preset to such a degree that allows the springs themselves to be resiliently stretchable only when they receive a great backward load caused under a backward inertia of seat occupant in a rear end collision case to thereby permit anticlockwise rotation of the two rotating links so as to cause the headrest to move to the upwardly displaced point.

In accordance with a first mode of the present invention briefly stated the seat back is of such a structure wherein a pressure receiving member and a crank member are arranged which are workable together so as to receive the afore said great backward load which is created from both dorsal and lumber parts of seat occupant under backward inertia of the seat occupant and then immediately transmit such backward toad to both two rotating links as a force of rotation sufficient to cause the anticlockwise rotation of those two particular rotating links against the biasing force of extension coil springs so that the headrest may reach the upwardly displaced point.

As understandable from the pressure receiving member is of a substantially U shaped configuration and arranged in the seat back frame so as to extend vertically from the support shaft and also extend centrally between the two lateral frame members and of the seat back frame .

Generically stated the pressure receiving member is formed by bending one rod material into a substantially U shaped configuration which comprises a pair of vertical pressure receiving portions and adapted for receiving a load to be applied from a seat occupant s dorsal part not shown and a cross pressure receiving portion adapted for receiving a load to be applied from a seat occupant s lumber part.

The pressure receiving member is formed from a rod material which is resiliently deformable by a load applied thereto in a direction intersecting the longitudinal body thereof while on the other hand having a rigidity in the longitudinal direction thereof sufficient to withstand a vertical load applied therealong and allow that vertical load to be transmitted therethrough without any deformation towards the support shaft . It is noted here that such vertical load is a great load applied along the longitudinal direction of the rod body of pressure receiving member having a degree of force enough to raise the support shaft and cause the above described anticlockwise rotation of both two rotating links .

Further generically stated the crank member having two ends and rotatably connected with the respective two lateral frame members and of seat back frame is movably connected with the afore said pressure receiving member at a point between the vertical and cross pressure receiving portions and associated with that pressure receiving member .

More specifically the crank member is depicted in to have a horizontal main portion a pair of arm portions and extending angularly from the horizontal main portion and a pair of connecting end portions and extending horizontally in a direction opposite to each other from the respective two arm portions .

As shown in the crank member is rotatably journalled between the two lateral frame members and of seat back frame such that the two connecting end portions thereof are rotatably inserted in the respective two bearing holes that are each formed in the corresponding lateral frame member at a point adjacent to the forwardly facing end of that particular lateral frame member whereas the horizontal main portion thereof is disposed at a point adjacent to the backwardly facing end of that lateral frame member . Both two connecting end portions of crank member may be provided with suitable stoppers to prevent removal thereof from the respective two lateral frame members .

On the other hand as seen in more specifically the pressure receiving member may be formed by bending one rod material into the illustrated configuration having 

 b a pair of horizontal intermediate connecting rod regions and extending a given distance inwardly of the pressure receiving member toward each other 

 c a pair of spaced apart lower vertical rod sections and which are offset inwardly from the respective upper vertical sections A due to the respective two intermediate connecting regions stated above.

wherein the upper and lower vertical rod sections correspond to the previously mentioned vertical pressure receiving portion 

 d a lower cross rod section corresponding to the previously mentioned cross pressure receiving portion .

With regard to the foregoing two upper vertical rod sections each upper end E thereof is securely inserted in a through hole of the support shaft see whereas each remaining main body portion thereof excepting that upper end E extends downwardly from the support shaft to the corresponding intermediate connecting regions . Both of so formed upper vertical rod sections are adapted for receiving a load applied from a seat occupant s dorsal part not shown .

The two intermediate horizontal connecting regions are rotatably connected with the horizontal main portion of the crank member via the respective two connecting tubular pieces . Namely each intermediate horizontal connecting region rotatably passes through the corresponding connecting tubular piece fixed on the crank member horizontal main portion thus establishing a rotatable connection of the crank member with the pressure receiving member . In this regard since the crank member main portion is movable along an arcuate path relative to a center of rotation which is at the crank member connecting end portions each connecting tubular piece may be of a proper non circular cross sectional shape such as elliptic cross section so as to absorb such arcutate movement of the crank member main portion with respect to the substantially rectilinear body of pressure receiving member .

It is to be seen that a width between the two lower vertical rod sections is smaller than a width between the two upper sectional rod sections and thus such narrow distance between the two lower vertical rod sections and the lower cross rod section cooperate with one another to provide an optimum plane for receiving a load at F applied from the lumbar part of seat occupant.

In this context generally stated when a seat occupant not shown using the present seat back structure assumes a normal seating or driving posture a lumbar part of the seat occupant is substantially in a close contact with the corresponding surface area of seat back whereas by contrast a dorsal part of the seat occupant is in most cases positioned away from the seat back . Due to that fact generally stated in the case of rear end collision as the seat occupant is moved backwardly under his or her backward inertia the lumbar part of the seat occupant is fist pressed against the lower cross rod section as well as against both two lower vertical rod sections prior to his or her dorsal part being pressed against the two upper vertical rod sections .

Therefore when a rear end collision occurs resulting in backward movement of a seat occupant under his or her backward inertia a lumbar part of the seat occupant is first moved backwardly to exert a great backward load F upon the lower cross rod section and then such backward load F is applied to an entirety of the pressure receiving member as well as the crank member at the same time. Consequently as seen from to the pressure receiving member is subjected to displacement in a direction backwardly and upwardly of the seat back frame with simultaneous upward and backward rotation of the crank member relative to the two end portions thereof.

Such backward and upward displacement of pressure receiving member in turn exerts an upward force upon the support shaft as well as upon the rotating link fixed to that support shaft at the same time. At this moment if the load F exceeds the biasing force of the spring both two rotating links are permitted to rotate anticlockwise relative to its center of rotation at against the biasing force. In that case both two rotating links commence their anticlockwise rotations and simultaneous therewith the support shaft is subjected to backward and upward displacement relative to the rotation center at of rotating link .

Hereinafter for the sake of simplicity a description will mainly be made of the left side parts of the above described pairs of constituent elements e.g. the pair of upper and lower vertical rod sections the pair of rotating links the pair of springs and so forth .

With the above described arrangement it is to be seen that a great upward pressing force overcoming the biasing force of the biasing means is applied from the pressure receiving member to the support shaft and at that moment the rotating link starts to rotate anticlockwise about the pin to cause displacement of the headrest towards the upwardly displaced point. In other words upon a load being inputted from a seat occupant s lumber part to the cross pressure receiving portion the rotating link immediately starts its rotation thereby insuring to reduce an impact given to the dorsal part of seat occupant at the point of time when the rotating link starts its rotation.

Further in spite of a relatively small stroke being given in the above described backward displacement of seat occupant s lumbar part to the lower pressure receiving portion the above constructed arrangement insures to transform the corresponding great backward load F into a great upward pressing force which causes upward displacement of the pressure receiving member so strong as to cause the rotating link to immediately commence anticlockwise rotation against the biasing force of the biasing means . This in turns causes both two upper vertical rod sections to immediately displace backwardly before it receives a backward load from the seat occupant s dorsal part thus effectively avoiding a direct impact to that particular dorsal part or reducing an impact thereto. Then following the foregoing commencement of anticlockwise rotation of rotating link a whole of the pressure receiving member continues to be displaced backwardly by the backward load being applied from the seat occupant s lumbar part so that the rotating link continues its anticlockwise rotation to cause the headrest to displace towards the upwardly displaced point while at the same time the seat occupant s dorsal part displaced backwardly under backward inertia of the seat occupant is pressed against both two upper vertical rod sections . Thus the support shaft receives increased backward and upward force from the two vertical rod sections and is thereby displaced in further backward and upward direction. This assists in continued anticlockwise rotation of the rotating link to insure displacement of headrest towards the upwardly displaced point of headrest.

Accordingly in the present invention it is to be seen that after the rotating link has started the anticlockwise rotation as above additional backward loads are applied from both seat occupant s lumbar and dorsal parts to the rotating link as well as to the respective cross and vertical pressure receiving portions and therefore the rotating link continues its anticlockwise or backward rotation so that the headrest is continuously displaced toward the upwardly displaced point of headrest and eventually retained thereat so long as the afore said additional backward loads are applied to the rotating link.

Further it is to be seen that after the rotating link has started the anticlockwise rotation to execute the above described prior backward displacement of both two upper vertical rod sections the seat occupant s dorsal part is pressed against such backwardly moving vertical rod sections which means that an impact given from those two vertical rod sections to the seat occupant s dorsal part is considerably lessened. Accordingly it is to be appreciated that such prior anticlockwise rotation of the rotating link and the subsequent continued likewise rotation of that particular rotating link provides an increased insurance of lessening an impact given to the seat occupant.

In this connection however it must be considered that in a rear end collision the seat occupant s dorsal part will be sunk deeply into the elastic surface of the seat back which will change the seating posture of the seat occupant and therefore it is possible that the backward pressing force of seat occupant s lumbar part caused under the backward inertia to the cross pressure receiving portion may decrease correspondingly and may be insufficient to move the same . According to the present invention at that moment both two upper vertical rod sections receive the seat occupant s dorsal part being pressed thereagainst under backward inertia of that particular dorsal part and are displaced backwardly thereby resulting in continued anticlockwise rotation of the rotating link against the biasing force of the biasing means so that the headrest continued to be displaced towards the upwardly displaced point of headrest and is eventually retained thereat so long as a backward load is applied from the seat occupant s dorsal part to the two upper vertical rod sections . Hence in the present invention without any resort to the backward load from the seat occupant s lumber part alone the headrest can also be displaced by the backward load from the seat occupant s dorsal part in a direction to the upwardly displaced point of headrest and be retained thereat.

In addition a whole of the pressure receiving member by the reason of its resilient property stated previously can be warped backwardly of the seat cushion frame which also lessens an impact to both lumbar and dorsal parts of seat occupant.

Accordingly the present invention makes it possible to simply achieve both of the following two aspects a high performance of the above described prior anticlockwise rotation of rotating link which avoids excessive impact given to a seat occupant and a high reliability of the above described mechanism that insures to displace the headrest to the upwardly displaced point of headrest and retain thereat without resort to the pressing force applied from the seat occupant s lumber part.

Furthermore according to the present first embodiment the crank member and pressure receiving member are only provided as a major constituent element for receiving both two loads applied from the respective lumbar and dorsal parts of seat occupant and also achieving the above described various effects and advantages which therefore greatly simplifies the structure of seat back .

The crank member can be easily attached to both two lateral frame members of seat back frame by simply securing the two ends thereof rotatably in the respective two bearing holes formed in the respective two lateral frame members . Also the pressure receiving member can be easily connected between that crank member and the support shaft by simply connecting the intermediate region at thereof with that crank member via the connecting tubular pieces while simply inserting the two upper ends at E thereof in the respective two through holes formed in the support shaft .

Thus it is possible to easily and accurately locate the parts in the corresponding positions during assembly of seat back thereby making formation of relevant parts in the seat back more efficient and rapid.

Still further in the present invention there is no guide means such as a guide hole for guiding the pressure receiving member which permits great freedom of movement of that pressure receiving member . Hence upon receiving a load F the pressure receiving member is quickly displaced backwardly to insure highly rapid movement of the headrest to the upwardly displaced point.

In the present embodiment the biasing means is provided as a biasing force that always efforts to return the headrest to the lower headrest home position and therefore in order to retain the headrest at the upwardly displaced point of headrest it is necessary to keep providing a greater force than such biasing force to the headrest . In this regard a comparative review of indicates that the rotating link has been rotated anticlockwise by a certain angle of rotation which means that the headrest is positioned at the upwardly displaced point. Under such state according to the present invention with respect to such angle of rotation of the rotating link a line of force of that extension coil spring is disposed at a point adjacent to and backwardly of the central axis of pivot pin This arrangement is intended to reduce a biasing force transmission efficiency of the extension coil spring which attempts to transmit a clockwise biasing force to the rotating link for return of the headrest to the lower headrest home position.

Namely in such particular arrangement the line of force of the biasing means or the extension coil spring is disposed adjacent to the pivotal point of the rotating link which is effective in intentionally decreasing the biasing force transmission efficiency of the extension coil spring to transmit its biasing force to the rotating link that has been rotated anticlockwise as in with the headrest set at the upwardly disposed point. This insures to weaken a biasing force required for the extension coil spring to cause clockwise rotation of the rotating link sufficient to initiate return of the headrest to the lower home position from the upwardly displaced point. Hence when the headrest is at the upwardly disposed point the biasing force of the spring can be overcome by a relatively small force. In other words insofar as at least one load exceeding a predetermined degree is applied from either of the seat occupant s lumbar and dorsal parts to the biasing means through the corresponding one of the vertical and cross pressure receiving portions the biasing force of the extension coil spring is overcome thereby and inactive so that the rotating link is still retained in the state shown in and therefore the headrest is retained at the upwardly displaced point. Such particular arrangement insures to retain the headrest at the upwardly displaced point in a rear end collision case or the like thereby providing a high reliable headrest action.

Reference is now made to which shows an angular relation among the rotating link support shaft and holder bracket under the above described state where the rotating link has been rotated anticlockwise by the angle of rotation shown in the with the headrest being positioned at the upwardly displaced point.

As stated previously the holder bracket is slidably inserted in the guide element secured on the seat back frame upper member in such a manner as to be inclinable in the previously mentioned manner and the lower portion of the holder bracket is integrally connected with the support shaft extended between the left side and right side rotating links .

Now let us assume that a rear end collision occurs and a head of seat occupant therefore moves forwardly and quickly moves back to the headrest thereby inputting a backward load of the head or what is generally described as a rebound load to that headrest as indicated by the solid arrow RF in . Such rebound load RF is oriented in a direction below the central axis of pivot pin which is a center of rotation of the rotating link . Thus there is the possibility that the rotating link may be caused by the rebound load RF to rotate clockwise which will undesirably result in downward displacement of the headrest from the upwardly displaced point to the lower home position.

However in the present invention as seen in the an active force P generated by the rebound load RF at the support shaft is oriented in a direction not consistent with rotation direction of the rotating link required to displace the headrest to the lower home position. Therefore the rebound load RF applied to the rotating link does not develop into any active force enough to cause the headrest to move towards the lower home position.

Further under the same situation as stated above where the rotating link has been rotated anticlockwise as in and the headrest is positioned at the upwardly displaced point suppose that a rear end collision occurs. In that instance as understandable from abrupt backward movement of both lumbar and dorsal parts of seat occupant to the pressure receiving member generates and applies an upward active force P to the support shaft while at the same time the above noted rebound load RF exerted on the headrest generates and applies an different active force P to the support shaft . In this case also the rebound load RF is applied to the rotating link in a direction below the rotation center at of that particular rotating link which may develop the rebound load RF into an active force sufficient to cause clockwise rotation of the rotating link for downward displacement of the headrest to the lower home position.

However in the present invention as seen in a distance L between the active point of the active force P of the rebound load RF and the central axis of the pivot pin of the rotating link is apparently quite smaller than a distance L between the central axis of the support shaft and the pivotal point s central axis . Hence a torque P L attained by the rebound load RF which attempts to cause clockwise rotation of the rotating link is considerably smaller than a torque P L attained by the upward force transmitted from the seat occupant s lumbar and dorsal parts through the pressure receiving member which attempts to cause anticlockwise rotation of the rotating link .

Namely the upward force transmitted from the pressure receiving member is extremely greater than the rebound load RF transmitted from the headrest whereupon the rotating link is still biased in the anticlockwise direction thereby insuring to prevent the headrest against downward displacement toward the lower home position so that the headrest is retained unmoved at the upwardly displaced point irrespective of the rebound load RF being applied thereto.

Accordingly the foregoing structural aspect also insures to retain the headrest at the upwardly displaced point in a rear end collision case or the like thereby positively adding to the high reliable emergency headrest action of the present invention.

In the present mode of the invention as described previously the guide element is so formed to have provided in combination therein two first support surfaces and two second support surfaces in such a manner that one set of those support surfaces are defined in the respective forward and backward inner walls thereof as seen in . It is to be seen that the two first support surfaces assume a certain common angle of inclination which is equal to an angle of inclination at which the holder bracket upper rectilinear portion is inclined when the headrest is displaced to the upwardly displaced point whereas the two second support surfaces assume a certain common angle of inclination which is equal to an angle of inclination at which the holder bracket upper rectilinear portion assumes when the headrest is at the lower home position. It is therefore appreciated that such arrangement of guide element insures that both two opposite lateral surfaces of the holder bracket upper rectilinear portion are brought in close contact with and positively retained between the respective two support surfaces or stated above whichever the headrest is at the lower home position or at the upwardly displaced point. This assuredly retains the holder bracket against wobbling or rattling at the guide element thus insuring to prevent dangerous dislocation of the headrest from a given point for receiving and supporting a head of seat occupant at any one of the lower home position and upwardly displaced point.

As shown by way of example each of the two actuator link assemblies is basically formed by a combination of an upper long link member and a lower short link member such that those two link members are rotatably connected with each other.

Specifically the upper long link member is at the upper end thereof pivotally connected via a pin with the second connecting region of rotating link while being at the lower end thereof pivotally connected via a pin with an upper end of the lower short link member . The lower end of the lower short link member is pivotally connected via a pin with the inward surface of the seat back frame lateral frame member thereby allowing the upper end of lower short link member to be rotatable upwardly and downwardly relative to the pin . With such construction it is seen that upon the upper long link member being moved in a direction backwardly and upwardly of the seat back frame with concurrent clockwise rotation of the lower short link member an entirety of the actuator link element is stretched to increase its length in the longitudinal direction thereof whereas on the other hand upon the upper long link member being moved in a direction forwardly and upwardly of the seat back frame an entirety of the actuator link element is contracted to decrease its length.

As seen in the crank member is at the two horizontal end portions thereof rotatably secured in the respective two connecting holes formed in the respective two upper long link members of the two actuator link elements .

Designations and denote a pair of guide stopper members adapted for guiding the respective two actuator link elements in conjunction with movement of the crank member and also limiting further unrequited downward displacement of the crank member at the point of time when the headrest is set at the lower home position. Each guide stopper member is fixedly attached to each of the upper long link member and has a recessed region H formed therein. As shown each arm portion of the crank member passes through such recessed region H . With the above described arrangement when a rear end collision occurs a whole of the pressure receiving element is displaced by a load applied from seat occupant s lumbar and dorsal parts in a direction backwardly and upwardly of the seat cushion frame in the same manner as described previously in the first embodiment. Simultaneous therewith such displacement of the pressure receiving element causes the crank member to displace backwardly and upwardly with each arm portion of the crank member contacting an edge of the recessed region H of the guide stopper member so that the upper long link member is subjected to backward and upward displacement with concurrent clockwise rotation of the lower short link member relative to the pin . Thus the two actuator link elements are stretched to increase its length in the longitudinal direction thereof to thereby apply an upward force to the respective two rotating links thus attempting to cause anticlockwise rotation of both two rotating links . At this moment those two rotating links also simultaneously receives an upward force from the pressure receiving element which is being concurrently displaced backwardly and upwardly to raise the rotating links as stated earlier.

Accordingly the previously discussed quick commencement and continuation of anticlockwise rotation of both two rotating links is made more positive and assured by application thereto of the foregoing two upward forces from the pressure receiving element and the two actuator link elements .

The embodiment described thus far is just intended for explaining one aspect of the present invention and therefore it should be understood that the present invention is not limited to the illustrated embodiment but any other modification and rearrangement may be applied to the invention without departing from the scopes of the appended claims.

The present invention is generally applied to a headrest connectable with and releasable from a seat back as described above but may be applied to a headrest of the type that is not releasable from the seat back for example.
