The subject matter of this patent application relates to computer software architecture and more particularly to the architecture of application software for time recording.

Enterprise software systems are generally large and complex. Such systems can require many different components distributed across many different hardware platforms possibly in several different geographical locations. Thus the architecture of a large software application i.e. what its components are and how they fit together is an important aspect of its design for a successful implementation.

This specification presents a software architecture design for a time recording software application.

In its various aspects the present subject matter can be implemented as methods systems and apparatus including computer program products for implementing a software architecture design for a software application implementing time recording. The software application is structured as multiple process components interacting with each other through service interfaces and multiple service operations each being implemented for a respective process component. The process components include a Project Processing process component a Time and Labor Management process component an Accounting process component and a Goods and Service Acknowledgement process component.

In its various aspects the subject matter can further be implemented as methods systems and apparatus including computer program products implementing a software architecture design for a software application that is adapted to interact with externals software systems through the service operations described in reference to external process components or a subcombination of them.

The subject matter described in this specification can be implemented to realize one or more of the following advantages. Effective use is made of process components as units of software reuse to provide a design that can be implemented reliably in a cost effective way. Effective use is made of deployment units each of which is deployable on a separate computer hardware platform independent of every other deployment unit to provide a scalable design. Service interfaces of the process components define a pair wise interaction between pairs of process components that are in different deployment units in a scalable way.

Details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and in the description below. Further features aspects and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description the drawings and the claims.

As shown in the time recording design includes a Project Management unit a Human Capital Management unit a Payroll unit a Financial Accounting unit and a Purchasing unit .

The Project Management deployment unit includes a Project Processing process component that is responsible for structuring planning and executing simple short term measures and complex projects.

The Human Capital Management deployment unit includes a Time and Labor Management process component . The Time and Labor Management process component supports the management of employees planned working times and the recording and valuation of work performed and absence times.

The Payroll unit includes a Payroll Processing process component . The Payroll Processing process component supports the execution and monitoring of regular as well as off cycle payroll processes including completeness checks of payroll relevant employee data the payroll run itself verification of the results and the transfer to financial accounting.

The Financial Accounting deployment unit includes an Accounting process component that records relevant business transactions for valuation and profitability analysis.

The Purchasing deployment unit includes a Goods and Service Acknowledgement process component . The Goods and Service Acknowledgement process component represents a confirmation by an employee of goods received or services rendered.

Not explicitly represented in the figures is a foundation layer that contains all fundamental entities that are used in multiple deployment units . These entities can be process components business objects and reuse service components. A reuse service component is a piece of software that is reused in different transactions. A reuse service component is used by its defined interfaces which can be e.g. local APIs Application Programming Interfaces or service interfaces.

A process component of an external system is drawn as a dashed line process component . Such a process component represents the external system in describing interactions with the external system however the process component need not represent more of the external system than is needed to produce and receive messages as required by the process component that interacts with the external system.

The connector icon is used to simplify the drawing of interactions between process components . Interactions between process component pairs involving their respective business objects process agents at and operations interfaces and messages at and are described as process component interactions which determine the interactions of a pair of process components across a deployment unit boundary i.e. from one deployment unit to another deployment unit . Interactions between process components are indicated in by directed lines arrows . Interactions between process components within a deployment unit need not be described except to note that they exist as these interactions are not constrained by the architectural design and can be implemented in any convenient fashion. Interactions between process components that cross a deployment unit boundary will be illustrated by the figures of this patent application these figures will show the relevant elements associated with potential interaction between two process components but interfaces process agents at and and business objects that are not relevant to the potential interaction will not be shown.

The architectural design is a specification of a computer software application and elements of the architectural design can be implemented to realize a software application that implements the end to end process mentioned earlier. The elements of the architecture are at times described in this specification as being contained or included in other elements for example a process component is described as being contained in a deployment unit . It should be understood however that such operational inclusion can be realized in a variety of ways and is not limited to a physical inclusion of the entirety of one element in another.

The architectural elements include the business object . A business object is a representation of a type of a uniquely identifiable business entity an object instance described by a structural model. Processes operate on business objects. This example business object represents a specific view on some well defined business content. A business object represents content which a typical business user would expect and understand with little explanation. Business objects are further categorized as business process objects and master data objects. A master data object is an object that encapsulates master data i.e. data that is valid for a period of time . A business process object which is the kind of business object generally found in a process component is an object that encapsulates transactional data i.e. data that is valid for a point in time . The term business object will be used generically to refer to a business process object and a master data object unless the context requires otherwise. Properly implemented business objects are implemented free of redundancies.

The architectural elements also include the process component . A process component is a software package that realizes a business process and generally exposes its functionality as services. The functionality includes the ability to perform all or parts of particular kinds of business transactions. A process component contains one or more semantically related business objects . Any business object belongs to no more than one process component. Process components can be categorized as a standard process component a process component at a business partner a third party process component or a user centric process component. The standard process component named simply process component is a software package that realizes a business process and exposes its functionality as services. The process component at a business partner is a placeholder for a process component or other technology that performs the essential functions of the process component used at a business partner. The third party process component is a process component or other technology that performs the essential functions of the process component provided by a third party. The user centric process component is a process component containing user interface parts.

Process components are modular and context independent. That they are context independent means that a process component is not specific to any specific application and is reusable. The process component is often the smallest most granular element of reuse in the architecture.

The architectural elements also include the operation . An operation belongs to exactly one process component . A process component generally is able to perform multiple operations . Operations can be synchronous or asynchronous corresponding to synchronous or asynchronous process agents e.g. at and which will be described below. Operation may be the smallest separately callable function described by a set of data types used as input output and fault parameters serving as a signature.

The architectural elements also include the service interface referred to simply as the interface. An interface is a named group of operations . Interface typically specifies inbound service interface functionality or outbound service interface functionality. Each operation belongs to exactly one interface . An interface belongs to exactly one process component . A process component might contain multiple interfaces . In some implementations an interface contains only inbound or outbound operations but not a mixture of both. One interface can contain both synchronous and asynchronous operations. All operations of the same type either inbound or outbound which belong to the same message choreography will belong to the same interface. Thus generally all outbound operations directed to the same other process component are in one interface .

The architectural elements also include the message . Operations transmit and receive messages . Any convenient messaging infrastructure can be used. A message is information conveyed from one process component instance to another with the expectation that activity will ensue. An operation can use multiple message types for inbound outbound or error messages. When two process components are in different deployment units invocation of an operation of one process component by the other process component is accomplished by an operation on the other process component sending a message to the first process component. In some implementations the message is a form based message that can be translated into a recognized format for an external process component . The form message type is a message type used for documents structured in forms. The form message type can be used for printing faxing emailing or other events using documents structured in forms. In some implementations the form message type provides an extended signature relative to the normal message type. For example the form message type can include text information in addition to identification information to improve human reading.

The architectural elements also include the process agent e.g. at and . Process agents do business processing that involves the sending or receiving of messages . Each operation will generally have at least one associated process agent. The process agent can be associated with one or more operations . Process agents at and can be either inbound or outbound and either synchronous or asynchronous.

Asynchronous outbound process agents are called after a business object changes e.g. after a create update or delete of a business object instance. Synchronous outbound process agents are generally triggered directly by a business object .

An outbound process agent and will generally perform some processing of the data of the business object instance whose change triggered the event. An outbound agent triggers subsequent business process steps by sending messages using well defined outbound services to another process component which generally will be in another deployment unit or to an external system. An outbound process agent is linked to the one business object that triggers the agent but it is sent not to another business object but rather to another process component. Thus the outbound process agent can be implemented without knowledge of the exact business object design of the recipient process component.

Inbound process agents and are called after a message has been received. Inbound process agents are used for the inbound part of a message based communication. An inbound process agent starts the execution of the business process step requested in a message by creating or updating one or multiple business object instances. An inbound process agent is not the agent of a business object but of its process component. An inbound process agent can act on multiple business objects in a process component.

Synchronous agents and are used when a process component requires a more or less immediate response from another process component and is waiting for that response to continue its work.

Operations and process components are described in this specification in terms of process agents. However in alternative implementations process components and operations can be implemented without use of agents by using other conventional techniques to perform the functions described in this specification.

The architectural elements also include the communication channel template. The communication channel template is a modeling entity that represents a set of technical settings used for communication. The technical settings can include details for inbound or outbound processing of a message. The details can be defined in the communication channel template. In particular the communication channel template defines an adapter type a transport protocol and a message protocol. In some implementations various other parameters may be defined based on a selected adapter type. For example the communication channel template can define a security level conversion parameters default exchange infrastructure parameters processing parameters download URI parameters and specific message properties.

The communication channel template can interact with internal or external process components at and . To interact with an internal process component the communication channel template is received and uploaded to be used with an operation and interface pair. To interact with an external process component the communication channel template is received and uploaded to be used with an external entity such as an external bank business partner or supplier.

The architectural elements also include the deployment unit . A deployment unit includes one or more process components that are deployed together on a single computer system platform. Conversely separate deployment units can be deployed on separate physical computing systems. For this reason a boundary of a deployment unit defines the limits of an application defined transaction i.e. a set of actions that have the ACID properties of atomicity consistency isolation and durability. To make use of database manager facilities the architecture requires that all operations of such a transaction be performed on one physical database as a consequence the processes of such a transaction must be performed by the process components of one instance of one deployment unit .

The process components of one deployment unit interact with those of another deployment unit using messages passed through one or more data communication networks or other suitable communication channels. Thus a deployment unit deployed on a platform belonging to one business can interact with a deployment unit software entity deployed on a separate platform belonging to a different and unrelated business allowing for business to business communication. More than one instance of a given deployment unit can execute at the same time on the same computing system or on separate physical computing systems. This arrangement allows the functionality offered by a deployment unit to be scaled to meet demand by creating as many instances as needed.

Since interaction between deployment units is through service operations a deployment unit can be replaced by other another deployment unit as long as the new deployment unit supports the operations depended upon by other deployment units. Thus while deployment units can depend on the external interfaces of process components in other deployment units deployment units are not dependent on process component interaction within other deployment units. Similarly process components that interact with other process components or external systems only through messages e.g. as sent and received by operations can also be replaced as long as the replacement supports the operations of the original .

In contrast to a deployment unit the foundation layer does not define a limit for application defined transactions. Deployment units communicate directly with entities in the foundation layer which communication is typically not message based. The foundation layer is active in every system instance on which the application is deployed. Business objects in the foundation layer will generally be master data objects. In addition the foundation layer will include some business process objects that are used by multiple deployment units . Master data objects and business process objects that should be specific to a deployment unit are assigned to their respective deployment unit .

As shown in the Time and Labor Management process component includes an Employee Time Calendar business object a Notify of Service Provision from Employee Time Calendar to Accounting outbound process agent and a Service Provision Accounting Out interface . The Employee Time Calendar business object represents a read only calendar representation of the evaluation results determined by time evaluation from recorded time documents for an employee. The Service Provision Accounting Out interface includes a Notify of Service Provision operation or a Notify of Service Provision Cancellation operation .

The Accounting process component includes a Service Provision Accounting In interface an Maintain Accounting Document based on Service Provision inbound process agent and an Accounting Notification business object . The Service Provision Accounting In interface includes a Create Accounting Document operation and a Cancel Accounting Document operation .

The Accounting Notification business object represents a notification sent to Financial Accounting by an operational component regarding a business transaction. The Accounting Notification business object may also represent operational business transactions in a standardized form. The Accounting Notification business object includes data for valuating business transactions.

To create a service provision the Employee Time Calendar business object uses the outbound process agent to invoke the Notify of Service Provision operation . The Notify of Service Provision operation notifies accounting of actual services provided and actual time spent on performing the services by creating and transmitting a Service Provision Accounting Notification message . The interaction may be initiated when an active employee time calendar item with relevant accounting information is created. A Create Accounting Document operation receives the message . The inbound process agent starts the execution of the business process step requested in the message by interacting with an instance of the accounting notification business object .

A similar process is followed to for service provision cancellation. The service provision outbound process agent of the Time and Labor Management process component invokes the Notify of Service Provision Cancellation operation to notify accounting that a confirmation of a provided service has been cancelled. The Notify of Service Provision Cancellation operation generates and transmits a Service Provision Cancellation Accounting Notification message to the Accounting process component . A Cancel Accounting Document operation receives the message . The inbound process agent updates an Accounting Notification business object .

Interactions Between Process Components Time and Labor Management and Goods and Service Acknowledgement 

As shown in the Time and Labor Management process component includes the Employee Time Calendar business object an Notify of internal Acknowledgement from Employee Time Confirmation to GSA outbound process agent and an Internal Acknowledgement Out interface . The Employee Time Calendar business object represents a read only calendar representation of the evaluation results determined by time evaluation from recorded time documents for an employee. The Internal Acknowledgement Out interface includes a Notify of Internal Acknowledgement operation and a Notify of Internal Acknowledgement Cancellation operation .

The Goods and Service Acknowledgement process component includes an Internal Acknowledgement In interface a Maintain GSA based on Internal Acknowledgement inbound process agent and a Goods and Service Acknowledgement business object . The Internal Acknowledgement In interface includes a Create Goods and Service Acknowledgement operation and a Cancel Goods and Service Acknowledgement operation . The Goods and Service Acknowledgement business object represents a report about the receipt of goods and services.

To create a goods and services acknowledgement the Employee Time Calendar business object uses the outbound process agent to invoke a Notify of Internal Acknowledgement operation . The Notify of Internal Acknowledgement operation notifies the Goods and Service Acknowledgement process component of a service provided by an external employee. This notification is sent when an active employee time item with goods and service acknowledgement relevant information is created changed or cancelled. The Goods and Service Acknowledgement process component receives the Goods and Service Acknowledgement Request message . The message is handled by a Create Goods and Service Acknowledgement operation . The Create Goods and Service Acknowledgement operation creates an acknowledgement regarding goods or services using the inbound process agent to update a Goods and Service Acknowledgement business object in order to report the receipt of goods and services.

To cancel a goods and services acknowledgement the Notify of Internal Acknowledgement Cancellation operation sends a Goods and Service Acknowledgement Cancellation Request message to notify the Goods and Service Acknowledgement process component of a cancellation of goods or services. Upon receipt of the Goods and Service Acknowledgement Cancellation Request message a Cancel Goods and Service Acknowledgement operation is invoked to cancel the goods and services acknowledgement. The goods and service acknowledgement inbound process agent updates the Goods and Service Acknowledgement business object to report the cancellation of goods or services.

As shown in the Time and Labor Management process component includes the Employee Time Calendar business object the Notify of Project Task Confirmation from Employee Time Calendar to Project Processing outbound process agent and the Project Task Confirmation Out interface which includes a Notify of Project Task Confirmation operation . The Project Processing process component includes the Project business object the Change Project based on Employee Time Calendar inbound process agent and a Project Task Confirmation In interface which includes the Change Project based on Employee Time Calendar operation .

The business object uses the outbound process agent to invoke a Notify of Project Task Confirmation operation . The operation notifies the Project Processing process component of a project task confirmation or a project task status change. For example the notification is sent when an active employee time with project relevant information is created changed or cancelled. The operation generates a Project Task Confirmation Notification message .

A Change Project based on Employee Time Calendar operation receives the message . The Change Project based on Employee Time Calendar operation confirms an employee s working time for a project task including working times and additional information such as status short text remaining work etc. The operation uses the inbound process agent to update the Project business object . The Project business object represents a business operation that is characterized by a unique set of conditions. For example the conditions may include targets to be met organizational structure financial personal or time constraints on the project and others.

As shown in the Payroll Processing process component includes the Employee Time Calendar business object and an Employee Time Account business object . The Employee Time Account business object includes a summary of valuated employee times and of periodic valuations administered by employee time valuation. The Notify of Employee Time Calendar operation and the Notify of Employee Time Account operation are included in an Employee Time Calendar and Account In Payroll Input Maintenance Out interface .

The Employee Time Calendar business object uses a Notify of Employee Time Calendar to Payroll Processing outbound process agent to invoke a Notify of Employee Time Calendar operation . The operation notifies the Payroll Processing process component about changes to the Employee Time Calendar business object . The operation generates an Employee Time Calendar Payroll Notification message to send to the Payroll Processing process component . The Payroll Processing process component receives the Employee Time Calendar Payroll Notification message in a Maintain Employee Payroll Input Based On Employee Time Calendar operation . The Maintain Employee Payroll Input Based On Employee Time Calendar operation can be invoked to maintain information on an employee s time calendar. The operation uses a Maintain Employee Payroll Input based on Employee Time Calendar or Account inbound process agent to update a DE Employee Payroll Input business object a US Employee Payroll Input business object a CN Employee Payroll Input business object an FR Employee Payroll Input business object a GB Employee Payroll Input business object or an IT Employee Payroll Input business object .

The Employee Time Account business object uses a Notify of Employee Time Account to Payroll Processing outbound process agent to invoke a Notify of Employee Time Account operation . The operation notifies the Payroll Processing process component about changes to the Employee Time Account business object . The operation generates a Work Agreement Employee Time Accounts Payroll Notification message to send to the Payroll Processing process component . The Work Agreement Employee Time Accounts Payroll Notification message is received in a Maintain Employee Payroll Input Based On Employee Time Account operation . The Maintain Employee Payroll Input Based On Employee Time Account operation maintains information on an employee s time account. The operations and are included in an Employee Time Calendar and Account In Payroll Input Maintenance In interface . The operation uses the Maintain Employee Payroll Input based on Employee Time Calendar or Account inbound process agent to update a DE Employee Payroll Input business object a US Employee Payroll Input business object a CN Employee Payroll Input business object an FR Employee Payroll Input business object a GB Employee Payroll Input business object or an IT Employee Payroll Input business object .

The DE Employee Payroll Input business object represents a summary of employee specific input for German payroll for one employee. The US Employee Payroll Input business object represents a summary of employee specific input for US payroll for one employee. The CN Employee Payroll Input business object represents a summary of employee specific input for Chinese payroll for one employee. The FR Employee Payroll Input business object represents a summary of employee specific input for French payroll for one employee. The GB Employee Payroll Input business object represents a summary of employee specific input for GB payroll for one employee.
