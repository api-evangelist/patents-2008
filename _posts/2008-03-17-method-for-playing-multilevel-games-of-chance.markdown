This application is a continuation of co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 832 071 filed Aug. 1 2007 entitled METHOD FOR PLAYING MULTI LEVEL GAMES OF CHANCE by Scott Weller and Matthew Ross which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 e to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60 835 142 entitled METHOD FOR PLAYING MULTI LEVEL GAMES OF CHANCE filed Aug. 1 2006 both of which applications are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.

The present invention relates generally to the games of chance and more particularly to methods of playing multi level keno.

Legalized public and private bingo games abound in the United States and throughout the world. Bingo type games involve a plurality of participants each having at least one pre printed playing card. Typically bingo playing cards comprise five columns corresponding to the letters B I N G and O whence the game derives its name and five rows in a boxed matrix. Numbers and or free spaces populate the boxes in the matrix.

The game of bingo is played by randomly selecting winning numbers from a population of numbers. In a traditional bingo game a participant wins when a combination of selected winning numbers covers at least one row column and or diagonal of five numbers on at least one participant s playing card. However in many bingo games numerous other patterns that have been predetermined may also be used for winning these patterns include those known as Hard Way five in a row without using the free spot Six Pack 2 3 or 3 2 matrix or Small Kite. When a participant covers a winning pattern with winning numbers he or she declares Bingo Verification of the win occurs immediately and if the win is verified the game ends and no further numbers are drawn. Generally there is only a single winner for each game. If there are multiple winners the prize is divided equally among all winners.

Keno is another type of legalized public and private game common in the United States and throughout the world. Keno type games typically draw numerous e.g. 15 to 20 random winning numbers from a larger population of numbers e.g. integers from 1 to 80. Indeed keno type games typically select more winning numbers from the population of numbers than are required to win.

For example to play keno a player may select a minimum of four and no more than 10 numbers between 1 and 80. Each selection is called a spot so if one selects ten numbers one is playing a ten spot game. The player marks a blank keno card with the selected numbers hands in the ticket e.g. to a clerk at a casino as discussed below and receives a duplicate ticket in return. Typically about twenty winning numbers are selected from the population of numbers and game participants may win a prize if they match anywhere between zero and ten of the winning numbers. Thus a game participant still can win the top prize without having to match all or even any of the winning numbers drawn. Keno type games typically produce numerous opportunities to match winning numbers and thus many opportunities to win.

Moreover keno type games are flexible because game participants can choose how many winning numbers they want to try to match in each game for example two five ten etc. Correspondingly prizes e.g. cash jackpots are greater when more numbers must be and ultimately are matched. Keno prizes generally increase commensurate with the odds of matching all player chosen numbers. For example the prize for matching five out of five player chosen numbers may be five times greater than the prize for matching two out of two player chosen numbers.

Keno is typically played in casinos and in state lotteries. Casinos sell keno tickets to players at special counters or through wandering keno ticket sellers. A player can play more than one keno game on a ticket and need not be present in the casino while the keno games are being run. The player can come back and see if he or she won any games. If the player has won a keno ticket can be redeemed for winnings in the casino. Keno games run by state lotteries sell and redeem tickets in a similar manner to casinos with specified lottery sales locations e.g. bars and restaurants replacing the special keno ticket counters. Keno tickets can also be redeemed at these points of sale.

According to one aspect of the present invention a game of chance is provided. The game comprises of two or more levels. According to one embodiment of the invention the game may be one of the group comprising of keno bingo UK bingo and baccarat. According to another embodiment the game may be a combination of two or more of the group comprising of keno bingo UK bingo and baccarat. According to another embodiment all levels have the same payout table. According to another embodiment one or more levels have a different payout table than the first level. According to another embodiment one or more levels have multiple payout tables. According to another embodiment the number of levels is pre determined. According to another embodiment winners of the top tier in the final level can win at least one of the group standard a progressive and a rolling jackpot. According to another embodiment winners of the top tier in the final level must win a final drawing to win the at least one of the group comprising the standard the progressive and the rolling jackpot.

According to one embodiment of the present invention only one bet at the start of the game is needed to pay to play. According to another embodiment winners of each tier are required to play the next tier. According to another embodiment the winnings are paid out after each tier. According to another embodiment the winnings are paid out only at the end of the game. According to another embodiment the game operator is a casino. According to another embodiment the game operator is at least one of a state and a national lottery. According to another embodiment a player may enter into the game after a first level of the two or more levels by paying a bet greater than an initial bet to play the first level of the two or more levels. According to another embodiment a player may enter into the game after the first level of the two or more levels by paying a bet greater than a sum of the initial bet plus the carryover s to get to the level being entered. According to another embodiment odds of winning decrease as a level of the two or more levels is increased. According to another embodiment the individual payout is increased as a level of the two or more levels is increases. According to one aspect of the present invention a method for operating a game of chance is provided wherein the game of chance has two or more levels.

The function and advantage of these and other embodiments of the present invention will be more fully understood from the examples described below. The following examples are intended to illustrate the benefits of the present invention but do not exemplify the full scope of the invention.

Embodiments and aspects of the invention relate generally to new methods for playing multi level games of chance including keno and bingo. Though standard games of chance are popular existing games of chance have some deficiencies including that each game has only one level and thus finishes quickly without having time for the player to build excitement during the game.

Therefore aspects of the present invention address the above identified problem and provide a more exciting play experience for games of chance as discussed in more detail below. In one embodiment of the present invention the game of chance may be any game of chance including keno bingo UK bingo slots poker dominoes and blackjack. According to another embodiment of the present invention all the levels in the multi level game of chance need not be the same game of chance.

According to an embodiment of the invention a game of chance has two or more levels as illustrated in . According to another embodiment winners of each level in the game of chance may progress to the next level in the game of chance. Upon winning a winner may be given a choice as to whether to proceed to the next level. Preferably a winner must proceed to the next level. As illustrated in level of a level may have only one winner tier. The winners of this level may move on to level as one group. However as illustrated in level of winners may be divided into two or more tiers. For example all the winners may proceed to level as one group or preferably as illustrated in the winners of each tier may proceed to the next level as a group for each winner tier. According to an embodiment of the invention each level in the game of chance may have one or more winner tiers.

According to one embodiment of the invention a game may have to continue to another level until only one individual is left in the top winning tier. Preferably in another embodiment a game has a pre determined number of levels.

According to another embodiment of the invention any player in the top winning tier in the last level of the game may be offered a chance to win a final prize. This final prize may be a progressive jackpot that may or may not be split between all final chance winners. If no final chance winner exists the jackpot may roll over to the next game.

A typical keno ticket shows all the possible elements in a grid or pattern with the elements a player has chosen being highlighted or otherwise differentiated from the elements that have not been chosen. The typical keno ticket also indicates the keno games that the player is playing and may also indicate when the last game ends.

According to one embodiment a game may have a predetermined payout table associated with it. The payout table may have a listing of the ways to obtain a payout and its payout amount. For example for keno the possible ways to obtain a payout include matching all some or none of the player chosen elements with the randomly chosen winning elements for a specific keno game. The payout amount for each way to win may depend upon but may not be rigidly determined by the odds of obtaining the particular way to obtain a payout in the predetermined fixed number of drawn winning elements for example the odds of matching ten player chosen elements with twenty winning elements drawn may be twice that for twenty player chosen elements but the payout may be only one and one half times higher for matching the twenty player elements chosen versus ten player chosen elements.

The payout table may also have adjustments for a player s subscription. For instance the payout may increase if the player has a multiple game subscription or high payment per game. The payout may also be adjusted for numerous other criterion including frequent player credits. Of course all payout adjustments must meet any legal requirements for the gaming jurisdiction in which the game is played.

According to an embodiment of the invention each level in a game may also have an associated payout table. The following tables illustrate possible payout tables for a three level keno game. In this illustration the bet increases and the odds of winning the top prize decrease with each successive level. Level has only one winning and one losing tier. Level has two winning tiers and one loss tier. Each winning tier in Level proceeds to a different payout table in the third level the top winning tier proceeds to Level and the lower winning tier proceeds to Level .

As shown in a winning tier may include more than one way to match numbers. For example in Level matches of 3 4 or none out of 5 numbers drawn from 15 total lead to the same winning tier for the next level.

Bets for the multi level game of chance may be covered in any known manner. A player may decide to or is required to pay the bet required to move to the next level upon winning. A payout of the last level won may be fully or partially used or may not be used at all by the player to pay for the bet at the next level. According to an embodiment of the invention a player may pay one bet to play a level with winnings fully or partially carrying on to the next level.

For the payout tables in the three level keno game illustrated above a winnings table may be as shown below with a portion of the winnings from a level being used to pay the bet for the next level. In the illustrated winnings table each player pays 5.00 to play a game. In an embodiment of the invention the odds of winning decreases as the level increases. In another embodiment of the invention the individual payout increases as the level increases.

Prior to playing a multi level game of chance a game player may need to pay for playing. For example a game player may pay using money or loyalty points. In particular a game player may pay using money by debit card credit card check cash or account credit either with the gaming operator or an affiliated organization. Alternatively a game player may pay using loyalty points from an account held either by the gaming operator or by an affiliated organization. Loyalty points may be obtained from any type of organization but are generally associated with loyalty programs such as frequent flier programs for airlines frequent stay programs for hotels or frequent visitor programs for casinos. The game player may pay in person using a cashier e.g. at a casino or a state lottery agent .

Typically a player may pay to play before the first level is played in a game. However according to an embodiment of the invention a player may pay to enter any level of the game. The player may be new to the game or may have lost in an earlier level of the same game. According to another embodiment of the invention a player paying to enter a game above the first level may be expected to pay more than the initial bet required for the first level of the game or to pay more than the aggregate of the initial bet plus the carryovers for players winning from all lower levels to get to the present level. In the example illustrated above a player entering into level may be expected to pay more than 5.00 the entry fee to level or to pay more than 28.00 5.00 6.00 17.00 .

In one embodiment of the invention players may subscribe to play multiple consecutive game sessions. That is the player pays at one time to play many consecutive games. The player may also choose to have his or her subscription automatically renewed.

According to one embodiment of the invention players may also enter to play the multi level game of chance using an alternative method of entry AMOE . AMOE is a required available method of entry into a sweepstakes that does not require a purchase. Sweepstakes are usually used as a promotional or marketing tool. Any company or organization offering a sweepstakes ticket in exchange for a purchase is typically required to also offer an AMOE to the sweepstakes that is not linked to a purchase.

A common AMOE method includes requiring an individual interested in entering the sweepstakes to the sweepstakes entity a postcard with his or her name address or other contact information. Another AMOE method includes requiring an individual to sign on to a free Internet website and to submit the required information for free. Numerous other methods may be used for AMOE. Most sweepstakes limit the number of times one individual or family may enter a sweepstakes by AMOE. An individual entering a sweepstakes by AMOE is required by law to have the same odds of winning each of the available prizes as do individuals who have paid for entry e.g. by making a purchase of a product or service .

According to one embodiment of the invention it is realized that an AMOE alternative method of entry may be used to enter a multi level game of chance. More particularly it is possible to develop implement and run the game s of this invention with an AMOE method of entry as is usually associated with sweepstakes. An individual may enter the game by AMOE using the postcard or the online methods outlined above. The game player entering by AMOE has the same odds to win the payout associated with the game in which they are entered as do any other players who have paid for entry. The game player entering by AMOE may also be limited to a small number of game sessions within a given period of time. For example the game player may be limited to entering one game in one year or two games in one month. Other numbers of games and given periods may be any number and the invention is not limited to any particular implementation.

According to one embodiment the game session that the game player entering by AMOE is entered into may be determined by the game player on the AMOE entry form. For example the post card AMOE may be required to state the date and the time of the game session that the game player wants to enter. Alternatively the game entered may be the next starting game session after the AMOE is received and logged. As another alternative AMOE entries may be assigned to a specific game s each hour day week or other time interval.

The payout table for each game may also be supplemented by a jackpot that transfers from game session to game session until the jackpot is paid out. These types of jackpots are commonly called rolling or progressive jackpots. A rolling jackpot may be the same amount that transfers from game to game until it is paid out. A progressive jackpot is a rolling jackpot that increases as more game game cards or other criterion are played. According to an embodiment of the invention a single game progressive or rolling jackpot may be won by winners of the top winning tier in the final level. According to another embodiment of the invention the jackpot may be won only through a final chance determination.

The payout in each tier may also be affected as to whether the game has a fixed payout for each winning tier or whether the payout is shared. If the payout is fixed for a win all players that have a tier winner for a certain type of win will be paid the amount listed in the payout table for the win in this instance each player is playing solely against the game operator. If the payout is shared then all players that have a game winner for a certain type of tier win will be paid a total of the amount listed in the payout table. Each player may receive a share of the total payout depending upon how much he or she paid for the game or any other legal criteria.

The final payout may also be affected by a secondary bonus play. Bonus play is well known in the gaming industry and works to increase some payouts by offering the chance to multiply a payout.

One or more games may proceed concurrently the parameters of the concurrent games may be the same similar or different. For example the drawn winning elements may be used for one or more concurrent games if the predetermined set of elements is the same for the one or more concurrent games.

Additionally the games may run continually i.e. one after another. When one game ends another can begin immediately or in a short period of time thereafter. The games may follow a precise time schedule so that players know when games will begin. For example if game play in a game requires four and a half 4.5 minutes to complete then the next game may start immediately or in a defined period e.g. thirty seconds to maintain a schedule of games sessions. For example game sessions may occur every hour on the hour and at every five minutes in between i.e. at 00 05 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 of each hour . Because according to one embodiment the game sessions may run continually it may be possible that a game will have no game player or game card that is being played within the particular game session or instance.

Prior to a game the game player may choose from the predetermined set of elements for a particular game. A game player may choose the elements for trying to match the drawn winning elements for a game manually or using a computer system. Alternatively according to one embodiment of the invention a computer system may automatically choose the player chosen elements for a game player. Because a computer system can both choose the player chosen elements and draw the winning elements a player need not configure and attend each game as discussed further below.

The predetermined set of elements may be any letter or character number symbol color logo shape drawing or other item that may be represented. The element may be a letter or character of any one or more languages including but not limited to English Russian Japanese Chinese or Greek. The element may also be any random combination of letters or characters including words and phrases. The element may also be a number of any language including but not limited to English Chinese or Roman and the number may be represented by items. For example the number of stars in the cell or the dots on the face of a die or dice. The number may be negative zero positive integer fraction decimal real or imaginary and in one example the number is preferably a positive integer. The element may also be a symbol from anywhere such as for example astrology religion printing and computer fonts road signs or law. The element may be any color including but not limited to black white or shades of gray. The element may also be a logo of a company or product name or trademark.

The winning elements for a game may be randomly drawn by hand or by computer system from the predetermined set of elements for the game. When the drawing is by hand the winning elements may be chosen from pieces of paper drawn out of a hat or drum by using balls or discs in a rotating or air blown sphere or any other method that can be used for drawing elements for a keno type game. The hand drawn winning elements may then be displayed or entered into a computer system. In one preferred embodiment the winning element s is randomly drawn by computer system from the predetermined set of elements for a particular game.

The game player may view the game proceedings using television wireless or line telephone with display handheld device kiosk computer or in person depending upon the viewing medium it may be necessary to download game information prior to viewing while other viewing medium may allow viewing of the streamed game information. For example the game player may operate a computer system that has an Internet enabled interface e.g. using Macromedia Flash or Java and the computer system may display streamed game information within that interface.

According to one embodiment a player may purchase one or more game tickets from a vendor as described above. After all the drawn winning elements are drawn for a game a player may check the ticket for a winning number of matching elements and then inform the game operator that the game ticket is a winner. If the game player is playing the game remotely for instance over the web or interactive television or if the game operator is a computer system then the player may use e mail instant messaging or other electronic or voice indication method e.g. the telephone to notify the game operator of the winning keno ticket. The game operator would then authenticate and verify the game player and the winning game ticket. The game operator would then verify that the game player won by checking the game ticket against the drawn winning elements for the appropriate games. Such methods are well known in the remote and electronic gaming industry.

As stated above it may also be possible that a game card may be a winner because of not matching the drawn winning elements. For example in a game with forty drawn winning elements out of a predetermined set of elements containing seventy five items a game ticket that has no matches in a specific game may have a payout equivalent to a game ticket matching ten out of ten player chosen elements to the forty drawn winning elements.

During the period of time between the games a game operator may make announcements rest or any number of actions. If the game is played using a computer system then advertisements sponsorships public service announcements or any visual or auditory content may be inserted. The advertisements etc. may also be inserted into the game display during a game.

A game player may also be able to replay or review a past game using a video device including kiosk telephone with display television computer or handheld device. By accessing the proper game in the computer system a game player may be able to see a past game as it occurred the winning tickets and winning game player identity ies the drawn winning elements or possibly any other aspect of the game of interest.

According to another embodiment of the invention the game its games and the game play are partially or fully operated using one or more computer systems. A computer system may be a single computer that may be a supercomputer minicomputer or a mainframe or personal computer. A computer system may also be any multiple and combination of computer types that work together multiple computer systems may also be needed to run the whole game. The computer system also may include input or output devices displays or storage units.

A computer system to run the game described above may include one or more component systems e.g. system as shown in . One system may handle payment subscription and or AMOE by players to enter the games e.g. as shown in . Another system may handle playing and viewing the game e.g. as shown in and the third system may handle payouts e.g. as shown in . The game system may also be connected by direct line or network to other computer systems including systems for handling casino or hotel loyalty programs reservations in room television viewing or gambling floor kiosks. Connections to other computer systems may be performed using one or more of the system components described below.

A payment component e.g. system may include one or more of a number of well known systems e.g. as shown in . For example a player may be able to pay to play one or more games using a telephone and speaking with a call center representative who manually inputs player payment and subscription information into a computer via a user interface. In the computer data may be stored in a data structure that is stored in a memory of the computer system. As used herein a data structure is an arrangement of data defined by computer readable signals. These signals may be read by a computer system stored on a medium associated with a computer system e.g. in a memory on a disk etc. and may be transmitted to one or more other computer systems over a communications medium such as for example a network. Also as used herein a user interface or UI is an interface between a human user and a computer that enables communication between a user and a computer. Types of UIs include a graphical user interface GUI a display screen a mouse a keyboard a keypad a track ball a microphone e.g. to be used in conjunction with a voice recognition system a speaker a touch screen a game controller e.g. a joystick etc. and any combinations thereof.

The player information that may be input includes name address telephone number and age. Payment information may include a credit or debit card number or loyalty account information. Subscription information may include first game date and time number of games to play number of game pieces per game and bet per game piece. Based upon the payment and subscription information the call center representative would then verify that the payment information is valid and that enough credit or funds is available for the player s desired subscription.

A similar system may exist for players entering using the mail or a post card AMOE except the call center may be replaced by a mail center having representatives that enter information into one or more computers via a user interface. For example a cashier e.g. at a casino or at a lottery agent for players to pay cash to play may also have the ability to input player account and subscription information using a user interface of a computer system.

Computer systems or pay engines for handling electronic or online payment and subscriptions may also be used. Such systems are well known including Paypal and those that run online subscription services like the Delphion intellectual property website or The Wall Street Journal Online. Using such a system a player interacts directly with the user interface to input information into the payment data structure.

Various pay systems and the various user interfaces may be located on one or more computer systems coupled by a network with the computer system s containing the player account and subscription database s . As used herein a network or a communications network is a group of two or more devices interconnected by one or more segments of transmission media on which communications may be exchanged between the devices. Each segment may be any of a plurality of types of transmission media including one or more electrical or optical wires or cables made of metal and or optical fiber air e.g. using wireless transmission over carrier waves or any combination of these transmission media.

The above are merely an illustrative embodiment of the pay system component. Such an illustrative embodiment is not intended to limit the scope of the invention as any of numerous other implementations of the pay system component for example variations of online payment are possible and are intended to fall within the scope of the invention. For example the payment system component may include using pay per view systems associated with interactive television or the pay engine may additionally deliver a receipt to the player by either e mail or mail. None of the claims set forth below are intended to be limited to any particular implementation of the pay system component unless such claim includes a limitation explicitly reciting a particular implementation.

Payout systems e.g. payout system are also well known and may include one or more standard systems or payout engines for making payouts for winning e.g. as shown in . For example a standard application programming interface such as Quicken available commercially from Intuit Inc. Mountain View Calif. USA may be used to write and mail checks or credit a debit card credit card if legal in the jurisdiction of play or loyalty account. Quicken may obtain the payout information by accessing a payout data structure across a network. As used herein an application programming interface or API is a set of one or more computer readable instructions that provide access to one or more other sets of computer readable instructions that define functions so that such functions can be configured to be executed on a computer in conjunction with an application program.

 Quicken is merely an illustrative embodiment of the payout system. Such an illustrative embodiment is not intended to limit the scope of the invention as any of numerous other implementations of the payout system for example variations of online payout are possible and are intended to fall within the scope of the invention. Additionally a cashier may also have access to payout information using a user interface to the payout data structure through a network the cashier then makes a payment to the winning player based upon the accessed information. None of the claims set forth below are intended to be limited to any particular implementation of the pay system unless such claim includes a limitation explicitly reciting a particular implementation.

A game playing and viewing system e.g. system according to one embodiment of the present invention may comprise of a number of components for performing specific functions as shown for example in . The components may include for example storage components for data structures for storing game variations present game session information game session history and win history. A game playing and viewing system may also include components used to access the payment and payout data structures.

The game playing and viewing system according to one embodiment of the present invention also include a game engine. A game engine may perform numerous functions including drawing winning elements for a game and displaying the drawn winning elements through any communication means including on a call board on the casino floor over the Internet e.g. through a website or internet messaging or e mail or by text messaging on a cell phone. The game playing and viewing system may also receive communication from players indicating a winning game ticket. Communication may be received using any method including over the Internet e.g. through a website Internet messaging or e mail or by text messaging on a cell phone.

Acts described above and various embodiments and variations of these methods and acts individually or in combination may be defined by computer readable signals tangibly embodied on a computer readable medium for example a non volatile recording medium an integrated circuit memory element or a combination thereof.
