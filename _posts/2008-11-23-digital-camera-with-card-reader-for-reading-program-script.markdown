title: Digital camera with card reader for reading program script
abstract: A portable camera with an inbuilt printer device is disclosed. The camera includes a digital image capture device, an inbuilt programming language interpreter internally connected to the digital image capture device for the manipulation of the digital image captured by the capture device and a script input means for inputting a self documenting program script for the manipulation and filtering of the captured digital image to produce visual alterations of the image. A card reader optically reads the script printed as an array of dots on one surface of a portable card, which has a visual example of the likely effect of the script on a second surface of the card. The script is interpreted and executed by the interpreter to modify the captured digital image in accordance with the script to produce a modified digital image. The modification is visually exemplified on the second surface of the card. The modified digital image is then printed out on the inbuilt printer device.
