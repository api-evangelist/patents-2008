The sensors are designed in AMI 1.5 Î¼m 2 metal, 2 poly process. A unique maskless post processing sequence is designed and completed. The three post-processing steps are fully compatible with any CMOS technology. This allows any signal control/processing circuitry to be easily integrated on the same chip. ZnO is used as the piezoelectric material for the SAW generation. A thorough characterization and patterning optimization of the sputtered ZnO was carried out.

This application is a continuation in part application and claims priority benefit of the earlier filing date under 35 USC 120 of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 738 460 filed 20 Apr. 2007 the content of which is incorporated herein in its entirety.

The present invention relates to the field of surface acoustic wave SAW devices and specifically to improvements to in their design and manufacturing which then provides additional applications for use.

Acoustic wave sensors use a detection arrangement that is based on perturbations to mechanical or acoustic waves. As an acoustic wave propagates through or on the surface of the acoustive wave sensor material any changes to the physical or chemical characteristics of the wave path may affect the velocity and or amplitude of the acoustic wave. These changes may be correlated to the corresponding physical chemical or biological quantities being measured to provide sensing.

There may be various biological and chemical sensors using fiber optics chemical interactions and various fluorescence approaches. Such sensors may however have various weaknesses such as for example low sensitivity selectivity or an inability to be hybridized or integrated into sensing chip technology. Acoustic wave AW sensors however may be better suited for use in biological and chemical detection. As discussed in D. S. Ballantine R. M. White S. J. Martin A. J. Ricco E. T. Zellers G. C. Frye H. Wohltjen Acoustic Wave Sensor Theory Design and Physico Chemical Applications Academic Press 1997 acoustic wave sensors may use piezoelectric crystals which may allow transduction between electrical and acoustic energies. The AW sensor may use piezoelectric material to convert a high frequency signal into an acoustic wave and the higher frequency may enable the sensor to be more sensitive to surface perturbations.

Piezoelectric materials used for acoustic wave sensors may include quartz SiO lithium niobate LiNbO zinc oxide ZnO and others. Each of these materials may possess specific advantages and disadvantages which may relate to for example cost temperature dependence attenuation and propagation velocity. Such materials may however have varying transverse acoustic wave velocities low electromechanical coupling coefficients non linear temperature coefficients and may react chemically with the environment.

Previously creation of SAW devices has been complicated and in the case of CMOS fabrication it has been unworkable as the chip would be destroyed by the temperatures required to integrate the SAW device.

One of the major distortions in the transfer characteristics of SAW devices occurs due to the angular spreading of the surface wave. This spreading occurs due to the finite aperture of the conventional SAW IDTs Interdigital Transducers . The finite aperture causes a curved wavefront rather than the desired flat one which in turn generates increased insertion loss passband distortion and reduction of out of band rejection 1 . depicts this phenomenon. The diffraction can be decreased by employing wider acoustic apertures. An improvement of up to 30 dB in out of band rejection was realized by increasing the IDT finger apodization overlap as in 2 . This compensation requires careful adjustment of both the amplitude and phase of the SAW radiated by each IDT finger and is achieved by using IDTs with split electrode geometries 3 .

In the SAW literature focusing interdigital transducers FIDT have been extensively utilized in devices such as convolvers 4 storage correlators 5 time Fourier transformers 6 and radio frequency RF channelizers 7 . All of these devices employed the FIDTs to generate high intensity acoustic fields. The focusing phenomena of SAW fields have also drawn recent interests. Wu et al. 8 gave a detailed account of analysis and design of focused IDTs. In their work they adopted the exact angular spectrum of plane wave theory ASoW to calculate amplitude fields of FIDTs on Y Z Lithium Niobate LiNbO3 substrates. Qiao et al. 9 on the other hand applied rigorous vector field theory of surface excitation on the crysTal to investigate the focusing phenomena. As concluded the theoretical results demonstrate that anisotropy of the medium has a great impact on the focusing properties of the acoustic beams such as focal length and symmetrical distributions near the focus 9 . Although FIDTs have been proposed extensively in ultrasonic and acoustic literature for many years most of them focused on curved IDTs. The most prominent architecture that was investigated in this realm is circular arc interdigital transducer CIDT . In their work Fang et al. 10 demonstrated the focusing characteristics of a CIDT on Y Z Lithium Niobate LiNbO3 using the angular spectrum theory and experimental velocity data. They concluded that the use of CIDT on Y Z LiNbO3 can provide a very narrow and long focused acoustic field rather than a localized focal point. They also suggested that CIDT structure does not construct efficient focusing for very highly anisotropic materials. Conventional circular arc structures were also employed in 8 and 9 . Kharusi et al. proposed the FIDT shape as the wave surface 11 . They reported that its focusing ability is better than that of the FIDTs with circular arc shape. The wave surface is the locus of points tracked by the end of the energy velocity vector which is drawn from a fixed original point. The idea of using the wave surface as a design method gives rise to a variety of possibilities to be employed for different piezoelectric materials depending on their crystal isotropy and c axis orientations.

The piezoelectric crystals that are employed for SAW devices are anisotropic in general. Anisotropic crystals cause SAW propagation characteristics to vary with direction. In order to obtain the maximum electromechanical conversion factor the placement of IDTs on the substrates should be carefully examined. If a surface acoustic wave were to be propagated on an isotropic plane surface its velocity would be the same in all propagation directions. This is not the case for SAW propagation on the plane surface of an anisotropic surface such as piezoelectric substrate. In this situation the beam of elastic energy produced by the input IDT may not be along the propagation wavefront 2 . The solution to this problem is to apply beam steering which can be addressed by fabrication techniques. If the IDTs are misaligned with respect to the desired pure mode axis the receiving IDTs does not intercept the entire incident SAW beam which gives rise to additional insertion loss 1 . Elimination of this problem requires careful crystal fabrication and correct alignment of IDTs based on the crystal structure.

CMOS is short for complementary metal oxide semiconductor. Pronounced see moss CMOS is a widely used type of semiconductor. CMOS semiconductors use both NMOS negative polarity and PMOS positive polarity circuits. Since only one of the circuit types is on at any given time CMOS chips require less power than chips using just one type of transistor. This makes them particularly attractive for use in battery powered devices such as portable computers. Personal computers also contain a small amount of battery powered CMOS memory to hold the date time and system setup parameters.

SAW surface acoustic wave devices are widely used as electronic filters delay lines resonators in today s communication systems. Although telecommunication industry is the largest user of these devices SAW based sensors have many attractive features to be explored for emerging technologies in automotive torque pressure medical biosensor and commercial vapor gas humidity applications.

Surface acoustic waves both Rayleigh and pseudo SAW are generated at the free surface of a piezoelectric material. An application of a varying voltage to the metal IDT interdigital transducer generates the acoustic wave on the input side. In the basic configuration there is an input IDT and an output IDT. The acoustic wave generated by the input IDT travels through the region called the delay line and reaches the output IDT where the mechanical displacements due to the acoustic waves create a voltage difference between the output IDT fingers. One of the most widely used and interesting sensing mechanism that acoustic wave sensors employ is mass loading. Prominent applications are in film thickness monitoring gas liquid phase chemical sensing and biosensing. The delay lines of SAW devices are coated with some bio chemical coating which selectively reacts with the entity under analysis. This interaction produces a shift in the resonant frequency of the SAW device. By measuring this shift in frequency domain a detailed analysis of the entity being sensed can be completed. depicts the basic principle of SAW based bio chemical sensors employing the mass loading scheme.

Using a combination of IC compatible technologies such as Si micromachining thin film deposition bio chemical layer growth integrated electronics smart structures and systems can be realized. Considering the advantages that CMOS technology provides along with the ever developing CMOS compatible MEMS processes the SAW technology performance can be improved significantly. Therefore an array of SAW delay lines were designed and fabricated through a regular CMOS process sequence characterized and post processed using widely used MEMS techniques.

The design modeling and fabrication of a novel circular SAW Surface Acoustic Wave device in CMOS Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor are introduced. The results obtained in our previous work demonstrated that it is possible to design and fabricate SAW based sensors in CMOS with comparable performances to conventional devices. It is of great interest to improve the transfer characteristics and to reduce the losses of conventional rectangular SAW architectures for obtaining highly selective sensor platforms. Performance deficiencies of regular SAW devices in CMOS were addressed with this new architecture for improved performance. A 3D model for the novel architecture was constructed. A detailed finite element analysis was carried out to examine the transient harmonic and modal behavior of the new architecture under excitation. The devices were fabricated in 0.5 um AMI Semiconductor technology and the post processing was carried out using cost effective CMOS compatible methods. The results demonstrate that it is possible to obtain highly oriented surface acoustic waves by using the novel circular architecture. A 12.24 dB insertion loss improvement was achieved when compared to a conventional rectangular device that was fabricated in the same technology.

Although it is stated that equivalent SAW propagation in every direction on piezoelectric substrates is not a common feature the piezoelectric material that is used in our work ZnO presents a very small difference between the shear sound velocities propagating along 001 and 100 directions 12 . This property of ZnO makes it possible to assume isotropy for wave generation and propagation purposes.

In order to overcome the deficiencies caused by the diffraction of finite aperture the strong directional dependency of the crystals and to investigate the efficiency of fully concentric circular IDT structures in SAW medium a novel architecture was developed. depicts the layout of the new architecture alongside with the fabricated chip top view. This novel architecture consists of concentric circular IDT structures that are aligned on a common focal point. It addresses the previously listed deficiencies without using any of the methods listed in the literature. In contrast to the conventional rectangular SAW devices the input and output IDTs are not physically equal in size. The input IDT the outer circle fingers are much larger in size than the output IDT the inner circle fingers. This way a smaller amount of input power is used to generate effectively the same acoustic wave as the conventional rectangular devices. Moreover the reduction in the electromechanical conversion due to anisotropy is alleviated since the wave will be released from every possible angle of the crystal. The concentric nature of the novel architecture also eliminates the wave spreading problem due to finite aperture. Instead of spreading the wave on the delay line it concentrates the acoustic waves to a focal point. Due to the circular nature of this architecture the effective sensing area is also increased when compared to a regular rectangular delay line with the same dimensions. In addition this architecture provides a spatially uniform sensitive surface for detection of any analyte that is introduced on the sensor area. These improvements that are suggested by the novel architecture are utilized to collectively increase the sensitivity of SAW based sensors in general.

In order to model the novel circular SAW devices the equivalent circuit modeling based on Mason equivalent circuit was used as a starting point. The derivation of this equivalent circuit 1 and the application of it for CMOS SAW devices were carried out in detail in our previous publications 13 14 . This modeling approach applies only to conventional rectangular SAW IDT structures. Therefore it should be expanded to include the circular nature of the devices in this work. For this purpose a modified version of the AsoW theory is integrated into the Mason equivalent circuit model. This modification makes use of the total amplitude distribution and the wave vector definitions in determining the overall transfer function of the equivalent circuit.

If the cut of the piezoelectric material is fixed the wave vector k can be expressed as a function of propagation angle 8 . The ZnO that is used in this research has a perfectly perpendicular c axis and provides an isotropic medium for wave vector purposes. Assuming no dispersion or propagation losses in the semi infinite substrate and a linear system total amplitude distribution can be evaluated by the scalar field 15 

where xi is equal to 0 p 2p . . . Np and N is the finger number of IDT. kx and ky are the X and Y components of wave vector k as depicted in . i ky is the inverse Fourier transform of the acoustic source function i Xi Y and is provided by

In 3 W is the aperture of the IDT C an arbitrary constant and p is the period of the IDT as calculated in 13 . Equations 2 and 3 can be used to calculate the amplitude field of a conventional rectangular IDT such as the one laid out in our previous work 14 . In order to carry out a comparative performance analysis between the conventional rectangular and the novel concentric circular architectures the same design parameters were selected for the circular device such as p 12 um with single electrode width of 3 um. presents these important design parameters. To include the circular effect of the concentric architecture the AsoW theory should be modified. The equivalent aperture method developed in 11 describes that a curved IDT can be approximated by a straight IDT with equiphase distribution. This approximation modifies the acoustic source function with the inclusion of an angular function factor by exp 4 

where Xi is the path difference between the real aperture and the equivalent aperture of the curved IDT. Expanding the angular equivalence to a 360 degree full curvature and approximating each infinitesimal arc per angle as a rectangular IDT the novel concentric circular SAW device is modeled. The relevant geometry that is used to derive the total amplitude based circular correction and the pertaining wave vector is depicted in . The equivalent circuit derived in 1 is used to represent each infinitesimal element. Based on this derivation the transfer function for each such element is found and corrected by the angular function factor of 4 . By using the superposition principle the transfer characteristics are obtained as formulated by

where Hm f is the input output voltage transfer function for a conventional rectangular SAW device that was derived and applied in our previous work 13 . Note that this function is an improved version of the fundamental H f from 1 and addresses finger reflections and average velocity shifts due to high metallization ratio of these devices 14 . The effect of circular angular correction from 4 is incorporated in 5 to reflect the modification made on each infinitesimal circular arc element. shows the resultant insertion loss improvement when compared to the conventional rectangular device. The circular architecture provides an insertion loss improvement of 6 dB. This improvement can be explained primarily due to the superposition of the effective equivalent wavefronts on the focal point. Another significant difference is the over expressed side lobes when compared to the conventional SAW transfer function. This can be explained by the accumulation of small differences in wave arrivals from the equivalent apertures of each infinitesimal IDT piece per angle. It is important to note that this equivalence derivation is only valid for piezoelectric materials that have the wave velocity isotropy which is a reflection of the crystal isotropy as in the case of ZnO. Otherwise the wave arrival differences would be expected to cause completely distorted output characteristics for the case of an anisotropic velocity distributions of other piezoelectric materials. The primary acoustic wave propagation in this work occurs in the ZnO layer. Although the multilayered structure Si SiO2 Al would suggest a variety of possible crystallography cubic tetrahedral etc. the waves are generated and contained in the piezoelectric layer. Therefore the approximate full isotropy assumption holds true only for the ZnO layer.

Equivalent circuit model provides a good starting point for designing SAW devices. The results obtained in the previous section allow the determination of the primary design parameters such as the center frequency 3 dB bandwidth insertion loss and transfer characteristics at and around the frequency of operation. However it makes several approximations and assumptions to convert the acoustic properties to electrical representations. Although this approach provides a fast and relatively accurate analysis of the performance characteristics it is always highly desirable to gain insight into the actual electromechanical interactions and the fundamental physics of acoustic wave generation or propagation. Therefore in order to fully understand the acoustoelectric interactions that take place on the piezoelectric material and to closely investigate the behavior of the IDTs when designed in CMOS a comprehensive finite element analysis FEA was carried out for the novel Circular SAW architecture that is presented in this research. The details of the 3D modeling and Finite Element FE Analyses methodology were laid out in our previous work 13 14 for the case study of conventional rectangular devices. The same methodology and tools were applied to the case of the circular SAW architecture for comparative analyses of performance.

Coventor software toolset 16 was used to model the concentric circular SAW delay lines. After defining the 17 step CMOS process the 3D model is constructed. The meshed version of this 3D model is depicted in . This model is used to apply all the boundary conditions that were used in testing and the material properties that were used in fabricating the devices. A fine tetrahedron type meshing was used to mesh the primary elements of interest namely the piezoelectric thin film the metal IDTs and the oxide layers.

Therefore an initial modal analysis should be run to determine the frequency of the modes and the generalized masses for respective modes. Using the same boundary conditions and mechanical solver settings natural modal frequencies for the circular device is obtained. Table I lists down these frequencies alongside with their corresponding generalized mass figures. It also presents the maximum and minimum displacement figures for the steady state modal simulation. Mode 5 and Mode 3 provide the highest and lowest generalized mass figures respectively. The generalized mass associated with a certain mode is used in harmonic analysis for which the equation of motion is formulated using the eigenmodes that are previously determined by modal analysis. The generalized mass associated with a mode i is computed by 16 m M 6 

where MNM is the mass matrix for the device under analysis and the superscripts refer to the degrees of freedom DOF of the FE model. I represents the eigenvector for mode i. For harmonic analysis input excitation all modal values are plugged into the solver as eigenmodes. However the center frequency is picked as Mode 4 where the maximum displacements were observed to occur. Harmonic analysis is carried out to determine the actual center frequency value for steady state harmonic excitation. shows the resultant harmonic response in frequency domain. The center frequency is found to be 321.8 Mhz. It is important to note that the harmonic analysis presented in reflects the characteristics of the displacement vectors based on mechanical stress strain solutions on and around the operation frequency as opposed to the electrical transfer characteristics obtained from the equivalent circuit in the previous section.

Therefore in order to bridge this difference of medium for comparative analysis between the two methods a transient analysis is required to translate these mechanical results into their electrical implications. As evidenced by the results of the crossed field and AsoW theory explained in the previous section the FE model harmonic analysis also gives 12 folds higher displacement figures when compared to the rectangular devices analyzed in 13 . This is a direct result of the equivalent superimposed wavefronts that are concentrated on the focal center of the device. In order to demonstrate these wavefronts with their corresponding wave propagation transient analysis was also carried out.

The piezoelectric material properties obtained from tabulated data 17 and previous measurements 13 14 were plugged into the material database to be reflected in the actual fabricated device simulation. A transient analysis of 30 ns was carried out with solver timesteps of 0.25 ns and output timesteps of 0.5 ns. A periodic sine wave input of amplitude 1 V was applied as the input excitation. Stress strain displacement and wave voltage propagation data were simulated. shows the distribution of the displacement vectors in the ZnO layer for the 30 ns long simulation. Four discrete time snapshots were presented here for demonstration purposes. Duration of 30 ns seconds was selected to investigate the wave behavior even after the input excitation reaches the output IDT. As it is presented in the second step the wave reaches the first finger pair of the output IDT at 8.6 ns which implies a velocity of 3488 m s for a delay line length of 30 m. This velocity figure agrees closely with the acoustic velocity value of 3850 m s that was used in calculations for ZnO. As can be seen from the wavefronts the model used for the transient analysis is a scale down version of the actual fabricated device. This was imposed by the FEM tools to reduce computation time and resources. Therefore a new downsized mesh was developed without disturbing or altering the integrity of the device layers dimensions and architectural parameters. This allowed the meshing and the simulations to converge more rapidly and be fully completed without any solver malfunction due to limitations of the underlying hardware resources. As evidenced by the distribution of the acoustic wave the concentric circular wavefront is preserved as it is focused onto the focal point and the displacement vector reaches its maximum when it is exciting the output IDT. Although the circular device can be used in a symmetric fashion for its input output IDT combination in this research the outer transducer is used to apply the input signal and the inner transducer is used to detect the output signal. Due to the size difference of these transducers the effective impedance is reduced at the output port which in turn provides a higher efficiency for electromechanical conversion. It can also be observed that there are wavefronts emanating away from the input IDT outer circle towards the square edges of the die. These diverging waves could possibly reflect from the square edges and contribute into unwanted distortion. However since the inner circle is being employed as the output IDT for these devices the outwardly diverging wavefront edge reflections can only arrive at the output IDT in a delayed fashion. This delayed distortion would only contribute in as secondary or higher degree harmonics which does not distort the passband characteristics. Moreover as can be observed from the square edges cause the diverging circular wavefronts to reflect as non uniform dispersed waves that are much smaller in amplitude. Therefore their overall contribution will be potentially negligible when compared to the combined first harmonics of actual wavefronts. This study draws a close agreement to the study of bending modes in circular quartz resonators by Leclaire et. Al 18 in which the 0 1 mode is also found to be such that displacement of the disk is nonzero everywhere on the edge.

To obtain the effective insertion loss of the devices an output voltage analysis was also carried out. Average output voltage is extracted from the transient solver. shows the resultant output voltage characteristics. The maximum voltage is determined to be 0.055 V which translates into an insertion loss of 25.1 dB. This yields an improvement of almost 10 dB with respect to the conventional rectangular devices.

The Novel Circular SAW devices were fabricated in AMI 0.5 um 3 metal 2 poly technology through MOSIS 7 . The layout of the devices employs ideas that are completely compatible with any other commercial CMOS process. Therefore seamless migration to any other feature size as well as any other CMOS process can be easily achieved. The three step novel post processing methods were designed tested characterized and optimized in the previous work by the authors 13 14 . The same sequence with minor adjustments was used for the post processing of circular SAW devices. The four steps of the sequence are summarized in . All three post processing steps are completely compatible with CMOS and do not disturb any of the CMOS layers. The sequence starts with the cleaning of the dice after the completion of CMOS fabrication. Trichloroethylene TCE Methanol and Acetone accompanied with ultrasonic agitation were used for this purpose. The first step of the post processing is the reactive ion etch RIE of the oxide layers.

The etching parameters are summarized in Table II. The RIE step was completed at UCSB Nano Fabrication Facility. The second step of the fabrication is the RF magnetron sputtering of the piezoelectric material of interest. In this work ZnO was used as the piezoelectric thin film. The process parameters are listed in Table III. The ZnO sputtering was completed at Georgia Tech MSRCE Facility. The final step in the post processing sequence is the pad frame definition. The wet etch solution and recipe from 13 was used to complete this step.

One of the major challenges of the post processing sequence is to obtain highly oriented perpendicular sidewalls between the IDT fingers for higher performance. This challenge was addressed by using RIE which employs the top metal layers as masking for the underlying oxides. Due to the anisotropic nature of this etching method it was still applicable to the case of concentric circular fingers. This step provided highly oriented concentric IDT fingers without any loss of sidewall or connection metal integrity. and demonstrates the results of the RIE step. As can be observed from the figures complete elimination of inter finger oxide layers was achieved. The die dimensions for rectangular SAW devices and the circular devices differ in considerable amounts. This was due to differences in the foundry dicing. Therefore a new set of masks were designed for the last step of piezoelectric material patterning to accommodate the differences in the dimensions. Although there was a difference in the dimensions of the masking layers the same procedure can be applied to pattern the ZnO layer and open up the pads for electrical contact. shows a typical circular CMOS SAW die after the last post processing step is completed. A fully accessible clean pad frame that is free of any ZnO residue is obtained.

A rough piezoelectric film surface causes reflections and hence propagation losses. Therefore a smooth ZnO surface with the least possible surface roughness and small grain size is highly desirable. In order to obtain information regarding the surface roughness and grain size JEOL High Vacuum Integrated STM AFM JSPM 5200 was utilized. 3D visualizations profile histograms and grain size measurements were taken for all the samples at two primary locations one on the delay line ZnO and the second one on the IDT fingers. summarizes the results for these locations of interest. As presented in the ZnO on the delay line shows a maximum grain size of 82.5 nm which translates into an extremely smooth surface when compared to the reported 0.5 1 um for high mobility samples and 200 nm for low mobility samples 19 . More importantly the grain size distribution histogram shows a peak around 25 nm for an area of 25.7 um2 with a balanced bell curved extension on both ends of the spectrum. As can be seen in ZnO deposition extended on top of the IDT fingers without losing its low surface roughness values that were attained on the delay line. Moreover careful analysis from FIG. shows that a 939 nm of inter finger ZnO depth translates into an effective ZnO bulk depth of 3.061 um in the total 4.0 um sputtered ZnO. This depth provides an abundance of crystal structure where the wave energy is primarily confined to the 10 of the wavelength depth. In the case of the circular SAW devices the wavelength is 12 um and most of the energy is primarily confined to the top 1.2 um of the piezoelectric material.

The major subjects of interest for performance analysis of SAW devices are the transmission coefficient and the reflection coefficient versus frequency. HP 8712ET 300 kHz 1300 Mhz RF Network Analyzer was used for analyzing the performance of the CMOS SAW devices. An enhanced response calibration was carried out in order to measure and compensate for the losses and errors due to the connector cable irregularities and substrate losses. Cascade RF microprobes in GSG configuration were used to measure the transmission reflection and phase responses. To determine the performance improvements and to provide comparative analyses conventional rectangular CMOS SAW devices were characterized as well as the novel circular devices.

The rectangular CMOS SAW devices are comprised of two identical delay lines that are placed on perpendicular axes. The period 12 um and the delay line length Lrect 600 um for these devices. Table IV summarizes the pertaining device dimensions for both circular and rectangular SAW designs.

Although secondary metrics such as maximum rejection bandwidth and shape factor are typically investigated for RF filter design they are presented in this table to show that the finite element and equivalent circuit models effectively reflect the actual performance of CMOS SAW devices in design phase for sensor applications as well. In the case of sensor applications a reproducible transfer characteristic with well defined center frequency and insertion loss is desired. The deviations in these metrics can be explained by a variety of fabrication post processing and ambient variations. However the most influential fabrication variation on the center frequency is the targeted ZnO thickness. The variation for the measured ZnO thickness is 8.333 with a standard deviation of 0.534 which translates into a maximum variation of 0.332 um for a 4 um target thickness in this work. This variation shifts the effective velocity on the dispersion curve causing the center frequency to be higher than the finite element and equivalent circuit models both of which use ideal and fixed fabrication conditions.

In the experimental device characterization phase fabricated circular CMOS SAW devices are also tested for comparative performance analysis. depicts the S transmission transfer characteristics of a typical circular CMOS SAW device before any sensor processing is conducted. As it is clearly seen from the insertion loss behavior the circular device provides an insertion loss improvement of 12.24 dB. The FEM simulations predicted this improvement to be approximately 10 dB which closely agrees with the experimental result. Although the circular device provides better close in side lobe rejection it has a larger 3 dB bandwidth when compared to the rectangular results. This is explained by the difference in the delay line length of two devices. The circular device employs an effective delay line length of Lcirc 250 um as opposed to rectangular delay line length of Lrect 600 um. This decrease in delay line length causes the mode distance to increase. Hence the bandwidth will also increase because of this effect. This is due to the fact that the distance covered by the waves launched by the electrodes closest to the receiving IDT suffers less reflections and propagation losses which implies a shorter delay time 20 . A comparative performance metrics analyses between the equivalent circuit finite element model and the experimental results is desirable. Table VI presents these metrics in comparison. The FEM simulation center frequency result show a 0.42 deviation from the experimental results which suggests a much closer agreement than the rectangular CMOS SAW device case. The other performance metrics also show closer agreements with their experimental counterparts. The only parameter that suffers a large discrepancy is the insertion loss of equivalent circuit model. This discrepancy can be explained by the simplistic modeling and ideal conditions which are based on assumptions that ignore various sources of losses. However the equivalent circuit model provides rapid design dimension extraction. On the other hand FEM analyses result in more robust detailed and concrete SAW performance investigation during the design phase. However this is in the expense of time for development cycle. Therefore depending on the requirements in the design phase either method can be favored. Another important observation can be made by comparing the results with our previous work 13 14 . The circular and the rectangular devices that were compared in this work were fabricated and characterized by using the same methods. The devices of the previous work comprised of another technology AMI 1.5 um and the finished devices were packaged on DIP 40 packages for testing as opposed to the package free RF microprobe cable based testing of this work. Moreover the data obtained in the previous work reflected simple test structures with much shorter delay line paths which essentially reduced the losses. The calibration models for the package pins and the surrounding wiring were not incorporated in the results of the packaged devices which also contributed in seemingly better loss results. However in this current work calibration models for every measurement setup component wires microprobes and connectors etc. were calculated and incorporated in the final measurements. Therefore this method of testing proved to be more reliable and robust in terms of measurement integrity.

SAW devices are extremely sensitive to tiny mass changes detecting 100 pg cm less than 1 of a monolayer of carbon atoms. When coated with a chemically selective thin film the SAW device is rendered sensitive to chemicals that interact with the film. Sensors based on surface acoustic wave SAW devices are being developed to detect a wide range of chemicals. The SAW device is an extremely sensitive gravimetric detector that can be coated with a film to collect chemical species of interest. Based on these devices sensor systems have been developed that can detect trace ppm to ppb levels of airborne contaminants. Applications include weapon state of health environ mental and non proliferation monitoring.

Chemical species that have been distinguished as capable of detection up to 96 accuracy include the general categories of organophosphonate DIMP DMMP chlorinated hydrocarbon CCl TCE ketone acetone MEK alcohol methanol n propanol pinacolyl alcohol aromatic hydrocarbon benzene toluene saturated hydrocarbon n hexane cyclohexane i octane and water.

During the manufacture of analyte detection chips a sensor material is placed on the substrate. This sensor material may be deposited coated or otherwise applied on the substrate. In one embodiment the sensor material is any material which provides an electrical response to an analyte. For example an electrical response may be quantified in terms of impedance Z resistance R inductance L capacitance C or other electrical property. In an embodiment the sensor material may be a polymer. The material may be organic or inorganic in other embodiments. Further the sensor material may consist of regions of a nonconductive organic material and a conductive material. In other embodiments the sensor material may be insulating organic films that act as capacitors or composite films that act as inductors. A more detailed description of some sensor materials and their properties is discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 571 401. However the present invention is not limited to the sensor materials in U.S. Pat. No. 5 571 401 since other materials may also be used.

In a specific embodiment of the present invention the sensor technology may involve a series of conductive polymeric composite vapor sensors. The presence of an analyte may be detected through a change in for example the electrical resistance of a chemically sensitive carbon based resistor. As discussed above changes in electrical properties other than resistance may also be used these include the evaluation of capacitive and inductance changes.

Further the sensor material may be composed of conductor and insulator composites. This material may be placed on the substrate in a film. The organic nonconducting polymer of the composite absorbs the analyte which may be a vapor . This induces a change in the electrical properties of the sensor material. The sensor material may also undergo physical changes such as swelling. When the analyte is removed any changes in the electrical properties reverse. For example the resistance capacitance and inductance may return to their original value. Any physical changes would also reverse. The response of these types of sensors are reversible over multiple analyte exposures as well as reproducible over a large number of trials under a variety of ambient atmospheric conditions. Therefore a device fabricated using these types of sensor materials would have a relatively long service life.

In the case of using a composite such a nonconducting polymer and carbon black the sensor material will be temperature sensitive. When using temperature sensitive sensors the sensor should be kept at a relatively constant temperature to provide relatively consistent results. For example a temperature such as about 5 degrees C. above the ambient should provide good results. Further extremely high temperatures say above about 100 degrees C. should be avoided since these temperatures would destroy the polymer sensor material or rapidly decrease its service life. For this reason it is not expected that nonconducting polymer materials are to be used in the specialized environment of extreme high temperatures say from about 300 degrees C. to about 400 degrees C. or even higher. The polymer sensor materials will be usable in the normal temperature ranges from about 0 degrees C. to about 100 degrees C.

Using a conductor and insulator composite for the sensor material permits a very broad diverse collection of sensor materials. For example any conducting element including carbon blacks metallic colloids or organic conducting polymers and combinations of these may be used as the conductive phase of the sensors. Any organic material may be used as the insulating phase of the sensors. Furthermore an advantage of these types of sensor materials is that they do not have the stability limitations of conducting organic polymeric materials. A conductor and insulator composite also does not suffer the limitations from the types of substituents or restrictions on the ranges of swelling variations that can be obtained from backbone modification of pure organic conducting polymers.

After processing of a substrate or wafer is complete the wafer is tested to determine the number and location of the good die. The percentage of good die on one wafer compared to the total number of die on the wafer is referred to as the yield. Individual analyte detection dies are separated by sawing along the scribe lines. The analyte detection dies are then packaged and may be further tested to ensure their proper operation. These dies may be packaged in a variety of packaging material including ceramic epoxy plastic glass and many others. Packaged analyte detection die may very much resemble packaged integrated circuit chips. For some types of applications nonporous nonreactive materials like ceramic may be used.

In one embodiment the sensor material is deposited or applied at the wafer level before individual dies are separated. In other embodiments the sensor material is applied after the dies are separated.

Surface acoustic wave devices as biosensors are also well suited for the detection of biological agents. Positioning a receptor between IDT fingers to induce a phase shift or within IDT fingers to induce a frequency shift allows for electronic detection of bioagents. These devices have the dual advantages of high sensitivity down to picograms cm2 and high specificity conferred by biological receptors such as antibodies peptides and nucleic acids. Detection of bacteria viral particles and proteins has been shown with these types of sensors. Handheld biodetection systems incorporating these microsensors are contemplated as within the scope of the invention.

The surface acoustic wave biosensor arrangements may be used for real time sensing and for quantifying the levels of bacteria e.g.

Many monoclonal antibodies with high affinity and specificity for particular bacteria are available from commercial sources as well as the American Type Culture Collection ATCC . For example one of these antibodies the ATCC HB 8178 antibody may bind with the pilus with high specificity and affinity. Any known coupling chemistry may be used for binding the monoclonal antibody to the sensor chip surface.

It may also important to optimize the chemical linking of the antibody as well as the loading density. Independent fluorescence assays of the antibody density on the chip may be done using fluorescence labeled anti IgG. The chip may be incubated in phosphate buffered saline with fluorescein labeled anti IgG and may then be washed with a buffer solution of increasing ionic strength to dislodge unbound antibody. The chip may then be scanned using a Perkin Elmer LS50B fluorescence spectrophotometer and the bound antibody density may be

calculated using FL Winlab software which may also calculate various parameters such as for example the statistical variability observed in the surface loading between regions on the chip sample surface . This technique may be used to determine which of the coupling chemistries yields the best loading of antibodies.

Biological detection may include detecting of smaller molecular weight molecules as well as larger protein molecules amino acids and nucleic acids.

Current generated per analyte molecule bound to the biosensor surface may be compared to the response obtained from control. Analyzing the differences in the biosensor response may be useful for improving the chemistry and spatial properties of the biosensor arrangement to enhance its performance against the analyte of interest.
