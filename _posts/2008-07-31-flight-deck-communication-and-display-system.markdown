The present invention generally relates to aircraft flight management system displays and more particularly to a flight management system display that integrates an existing graphical flight path display with graphic and textual display of air traffic control or pilot requested flight plan changes and provides a warning of the possible inability to comply therewith or a notification of the potential negative impacts in complying for example due to environmental or avionic factors.

Presently most air traffic control systems around the world utilize voice communications to transmit various messages between air traffic controllers and pilots. The messages that are transmitted between air traffic controllers and pilots include among other things air traffic control clearances various advisories and aviation weather service which help ensure coordination of aircraft movement and appropriate aircraft separation. As air travel has increased over the years controller pilot communication has concomitantly increased to the point that the voice communication channels have at many locations become saturated during peak aircraft traffic periods. Moreover at the frequencies generally used for air traffic control voice communications the communications are limited to line of sight. Thus once an aircraft is no longer within a line of sight path with an air traffic control center voice communication is no longer available.

To reduce the amount of controller pilot voice communication that presently occurs and to alleviate the reliance on the concomitant line of sight communications a new data communication system has been developed that relies on data communication of certain controller pilot communications. With this new communication system some routine controller pilot communications that are presently transmitted over a voice communications channel can be transmitted over a data communications channel thus freeing up the voice communications channel for the less routine messages. For example the data communication system allows various textual aircraft clearance messages to be transmitted and received to and from an aircraft over a data channel. These textual messages are presently processed and displayed via a separate dedicated message display system.

Although the present controller pilot data communication system implementation is generally reliable safe and reduces the communication load over the voice communication channels it does suffer certain drawbacks. For example the textual messages that are transmitted to and from an aircraft are standardized thus pilot initiated textual messages are presently created using a cut and paste implementation in which the pilot selects one or more standard portions of text from a list and places it in the message. This operation can be cumbersome time consuming and can distract from the pilot s main tasks. Moreover because the system is implemented separate from the aircraft flight management system if a clearance message transmitted to the aircraft instructs the pilot to modify the aircraft s current flight plan once the pilot acknowledges the message the flight plan is updated either automatically or by the pilot in the aircraft flight management system. Again this added operation can be cumbersome time consuming and a distraction to the pilot. Moreover because the messages are displayed on a separate display the pilot s attention may be diverted away from the main flight deck display s .

When Air Traffic Control sends clearance messages to an aircraft the pilots currently need to interpret how the clearance impacts their current flight path in order to determine whether they can comply with the clearance. They also have to visualize what the new flight path or trajectory will look like. Therefore pilots are susceptible to safety impacting misinterpretations unanticipated A C inabilities to achieve the clearance and other types of mental transformation errors. Even with the updated clearance displayed on another display the pilots must consider whether this new clearance is safe considering environmental and avionic factors.

Hence there is a need for a system and method that addresses one or more of the above noted drawbacks. Namely a system and method for transmitting receiving initiating and displaying textual air traffic control clearance messages that is less cumbersome less time consuming and less distractive to a pilot and or alleviates the need for a pilot to separately update the aircraft flight plan using the flight management system when the textual clearance message requests such a modification while providing notification of 1 a safety alert when the clearance message puts the aircraft at risk e.g. due to terrain traffic and weather 2 an inability to comply alert due to constraints of aircraft performance based on e.g. current position altitude heading speed vertical speed and available thrust and 3 a negative impact alert due to the affect of the clearance on aircraft efficiency e.g. time fuel consumption and noise and emission environmental concerns. The present invention addresses one or more of these needs. Furthermore other desirable features and characteristics of the present invention will become apparent from the subsequent detailed description and the appended claims taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and the foregoing technical field and background.

A flight deck communication and display system for displaying an air traffic control clearance transmitted to an aircraft is described including a processor adapted to receive i data representative of a current aircraft flight plan and ii a textual clearance message signal representative of the air traffic control requested modification to the flight plan and operable in response thereto to supply a flight plan display command and a modified flight plan display command and comparing the textual clearance message signals with factors affecting aircraft safety ability to comply efficiency and environmental impacts to supply an alert message display command. A display coupled to receive the flight plan display command the modified flight plan display command the alert message display command is operable in response thereto to substantially simultaneously display i an image representative of the current aircraft flight plan ii the textual clearance message iii an image representative of the modified flight plan and iv an alert message indicating whether there are any safety ability to comply efficiency or environmental concerns related to the requested air traffic modification to the flight plan.

The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the invention. Furthermore there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or implied theory presented in the preceding technical field background brief summary or the following detailed description.

An apparatus and method is described that processes a current flight plan and a received ATC clearance message of a modified flight plan determines whether the modified flight plan will encounter any known obstacles or exceed any aircraft flight specifications and displays on the same display the current flight plan the ATC clearance message the modified flight plan and a message indicating whether the modified flight plan is acceptable or unacceptable due to the obstacles or aircraft flight specifications. The message indicating whether the modified flight plan is acceptable may be displayed as a text message a graphic symbol or icon which may be in color or flashing may be presented as an aural alert including spoken words or a combination of thereof. The obstacles may include for example natural obstacles such as terrain and weather or artificial obstacles such as a restricted area. The aircraft flight specifications may include for example altitude and speed.

Referring to an exemplary flight management system FMS includes a user interface a processor one or more navigation databases and a display . The user interface is in operable communication with the processor and is configured to receive input from a user e.g. a pilot and in response to the user input supply command signals to the processor . The user interface may be any one or combination of various known user interface devices including but not limited to a cursor control device CCD such as a mouse a trackball or joystick and or a keyboard one or more buttons switches or knobs. In the depicted embodiment the user interface includes a CCD and a keyboard . As will be described more fully below the user uses the CCD to among other things move a cursor symbol on the display screen see and may use the keyboard to among other things input textual data for subsequent transmission to air traffic control centers.

The processor as was just noted is in operable communication with and receives user input commands from the user interface . The processor is additionally in operable communication with the navigation databases and with the display and is coupled to receive various types of avionics data from various remote systems and or sensors not illustrated and to receive signals representative of air traffic control clearance messages. The processor receives the user input commands supplied from the user interface and is configured in response to these user input commands to selectively retrieve data from one or more of the navigation databases and supply appropriate display commands to the display so that the retrieved data is appropriately displayed on the display . The processor is additionally configured to supply appropriate display commands to the display so that the avionics data may be selectively displayed on the display .

The processor may be any one of numerous known general purpose microprocessors or an application specific processor that operates in response to program instructions. In the depicted embodiment the processor includes on board RAM random access memory and on board ROM read only memory . The program instructions that control the processor may be stored in either or both the RAM and the ROM . For example the operating system software may be stored in the ROM whereas various operating mode software routines and various operational parameters may be stored in the RAM . It will be appreciated that this is merely exemplary of one scheme for storing operating system software and software routines and that various other storage schemes may be implemented. It will also be appreciated that the processor may be implemented using various other circuits not just a programmable processor. For example digital logic circuits and analog signal processing circuits could also be used.

The navigation databases include various types of navigation related data. Such navigation related data includes various flight plan related data such as for example waypoints distances between waypoints headings between waypoints data related to different airports navigational aids obstructions terrain towers etc. special use airspace political boundaries communication frequencies and aircraft approach information. It will be appreciated that although the navigation database is for clarity and convenience shown as being stored separate from the processor the database could be loaded into the on board RAM or the database could be integrally formed as part of the processor and or RAM and or ROM . The navigation database could also be part of a device or system that is physically separate from the display system . The avionics data that is supplied from remote systems and or sensors includes data representative of the state of an aircraft such as for example aircraft speed altitude and heading. The transceiver may also receive data including the location of weather such as rain thunderstorms icing conditions and turbulence and the position of traffic nearby aircraft which may be presented on the display .

The air traffic control signals are transmitted to an aircraft via for example modulated radio frequency RF signals. The air traffic control signals are received and demodulated by a transceiver and are then supplied to the processor . The air traffic control signals each include data representative of one or more air traffic control clearance messages. Thus the processor further processes the signals and supplies one or more display commands to the display such that the clearance messages are displayed in both a textual format and a graphical format. As will be described more fully below the processor also supplies air traffic control response signals to the transceiver which in turn modulates the response signals and transmits the modulated response signals to an air traffic control station not shown . In the depicted embodiment the transceiver is separate from the processor . However it will be appreciated that the transceiver could be implemented as part of the processor .

The display is used to display various images and data in both a graphical and a textual format and to supply visual feedback to the user in response to the user input commands supplied by the user to the user interface . It will be appreciated that the display may be any one of numerous known displays suitable for rendering image and or text data in a format viewable by the user . Non limiting examples of such displays include various cathode ray tube CRT displays and various flat panel displays such as various types of LCD liquid crystal display and TFT thin film transistor displays. To provide a more complete description of the method that is implemented by the flight management system a general description of the display and its layout will now be provided.

With reference to it seen that the display includes a display area in which multiple graphical and textual images may be simultaneously displayed. For example general flight related data a vertical profile and a lateral map may be displayed simultaneously alone or in various combinations. The general flight related data that is displayed may include various types of data related to the flight plan of the aircraft. Such data includes but is not limited to the flight identifier route iteration number a waypoint list and associated information such as bearing and time to arrive just to name a few. It will be appreciated that the general flight related data may additionally include various types of data associated with various types of flight hazards. Examples of these and other types of data that may be displayed are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 289 277 entitled Interfaces for Planning Vehicle Routes which is assigned to the assignee of the present application and the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

The vertical profile includes a side view aircraft symbol one or more waypoint symbols A D line segments A D that interconnects the waypoint symbols a vertical axis and a horizontal axis . The waypoint symbols and interconnecting line segments correspond to the current flight path and flight plan of the aircraft. The vertical axis represents aircraft altitude and is suitably graduated with altitude values not shown and the horizontal axis represents aircraft lateral position and is suitably graduated with lateral distance values not shown . It will be appreciated that the horizontal axis could alternatively be graduated with time values in addition to or instead of lateral distance values.

The lateral map includes a top view aircraft symbol one or more waypoint symbols A D line segments A D that interconnect the waypoint symbols and one or more range rings . The lateral map also preferably includes various map features including but not limited to terrain political boundaries and navigation aids which for clarity are not shown in . The range rings only one of which is shown in indicate nautical distance from the top view aircraft symbol . In the illustrated embodiment the range ring includes a range indicator which displays the lateral distance from the aircraft s present position to the position on the lateral map that corresponds to the range ring e.g. 200 nautical miles . It will be appreciated that the value of the range indicator may be set manually or automatically via a non illustrated a pop up menu.

Having described a particular embodiment of the system and the general layout of the display area from a structural standpoint and having generally described the overall functionality of the system a more detailed description of a process implemented by the system to simultaneously display flight management data and textual air clearance messages and alert warning messages on the same display will be provided. In doing so reference should be made as appropriate to and in combination with which illustrates an exemplary process implemented by the system . It should be noted that the parenthetical reference numerals in the following description correspond to like reference numerals that are used to reference the flowchart blocks in . Moreover for clarity and ease of explanation the system is shown in in a configuration in which only the lateral map and when appropriate the textual clearance message and user interface field are simultaneously displayed in the display area .

Turning first to and in accordance with a first exemplary embodiment the lateral map for the current aircraft flight plan is displayed in the display area . As shown the aircraft has taken off from Waypoint A A is proceeding to Waypoint B B then to Waypoint C C and then onto various other Waypoints D D and so forth in accordance with the current flight plan as filed. The lateral map for the current flight plan will remain displayed until the processor receives an air traffic clearance message signal as a revised flight plan. Thereafter as shown in the transceiver demodulates the air traffic clearance message signal the processor processes the demodulated signal and supplies appropriate display commands to the display which in turn displays the textual clearance message and the user interface field .

The textual air traffic control messages that are displayed in the display area correspond to the above mentioned air traffic control signals that are received and demodulated by the transceiver and processed by the processor . The user interface field as will be described more fully below is displayed whenever a textual air traffic control signal is received and processed by the processor and the corresponding textual air traffic control message is displayed. Preferably the textual messages and user interface field are automatically displayed each time a textual air traffic control signal is received and processed by the processor . Moreover the message and user interface field both preferably remain displayed until the processor receives an appropriate response via the user interface field preferably in the form of a user command signal supplied from the user interface . Once an appropriate response to the displayed message is received the message and user interface field are preferably no longer displayed in the display area . In a particular preferred embodiment the message and user interface field are both simultaneously displayed on the lateral map . It will be appreciated that this is merely exemplary of a particular preferred embodiment and that either or both could be displayed with the other graphical and textual images described above.

The processor also determines whether the received air traffic clearance message signal indicates a modification to the current flight plan . If the message signal does indicate such a modification then the modification is graphically displayed on the lateral map with the current flight plan . For example as shown in the textual clearance message indicates that the aircraft e.g. Aircraft 123 should fly directly to Waypoint C maintain 10 000 feet until past Waypoint C and then consistent with the flight plan as filed. Thus the processor supplies display commands to the display so that an updated line segment that connects Waypoint A A to Waypoint C C is also displayed on the lateral map and the vertical profile . Though not depicted in but as shown in in a particular preferred embodiment the flight related data associated with the updated modified flight plan is also displayed in the display area . This allows the pilot to see how various parameters such as for example time and fuel consumption would be effected by the flight plan modification before accepting or rejecting the modification.

The processor compares the modified flight plan with data stored in the RAM or ROM to determine whether the aircraft in following the modified flight plan will confront any obstacles or aircraft limitations. If not a message such as REVISED FLIGHT PLAN ACCEPTABLE will appear as flight related data as shown in . If the modified flight plan approaches or infringes on airspace occupied by an obstacle or if an aircraft limitation is exceeded an alert or warning message will appear as flight related data . illustrate exemplary embodiments of such unacceptable modified flight plans. In each of these exemplary embodiments while the alert or warning message is displayed as text it should be understood that in the message may be displayed as a graphic symbol or icon which may be in color or flashing may be presented as an aural alert including spoken words or a combination thereof including text.

In each of the exemplary embodiments described above with reference to the processor will continue supplying display commands to the display such that the current and modified flight plans the textual clearance message and the user interface field are simultaneously displayed until the user appropriately responds to the textual clearance message . Once the appropriate response is provided the processor supplies an air traffic control response signal to the transceiver which in turn modulates the response signal and transmits the signal to the air traffic control station that sent the originating message . The processor also updates the flight plan if accepted consistent with the user response . For example in the depicted embodiments the user using the user interface places the cursor symbol over the Accept or Reject button in the user interface field and once again using the user interface selects this as the response to the clearance message thus accepting or rejecting the modification to the as filed flight plan. If accepted the flight plan is graphically updated on the lateral map . Though not depicted it will additionally be appreciated that the flight related data and vertical profile if necessary are also updated to reflect the new flight plan.

In addition to responding to textual clearance messages transmitted to the aircraft it will be appreciated that the system may be configured to allow the pilot to transmit textual messages from the aircraft to for example an air traffic control center. In one embodiment the pilot may compose a message using the user interface keyboard . The message while it is being composed is displayed as a textual clearance message in the display area . Then when the pilot is ready to send the message he or she may transmit the message by selecting the Accept button in the user interface field . Alternatively when the pilot is composing a textual message the system could be configured such that the user interface field displays a Transmit button rather than the Accept button. In either case when the message is transmitted the processor transmits the textual message data to the transceiver which modulates the textual message data for transmission to the air traffic control center.

It will be appreciated that the use of the keyboard to compose a pilot initiated textual message is merely exemplary of one particular embodiment and that the system could be configured to allow the pilot to compose messages using other means of implementation. For example the system could be configured to allow the pilot to select predetermined phrases or words from for example a static or drop down menu using the CCD . The words or phrases are preferably consistent with air traffic control syntax such and may be for example cockpit control language such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 844 503 entitled Method and Apparatus for Avionics Management which is assigned to the assignee of the present application the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

In addition to automatically updating a current flight plan in response to a clearance message the system is also preferably configured to generate and transmit a textual message in response to the pilot graphically updating the flight plan. For example with reference once again to if the pilot using the user interface graphically modified the flight plan so that the aircraft would fly directly from Waypoint A A to Waypoint C C then the processor would automatically generate the textual clearance message . Upon acceptance by the pilot the processor would transmit the data to the transceiver which would modulate and transmit the message to the appropriate air traffic control center.

While at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in the foregoing detailed description it should be appreciated that a vast number of variations exist. It should also be appreciated that the exemplary embodiment or exemplary embodiments are only examples and are not intended to limit the scope applicability or configuration of the invention in any way. Rather the foregoing detailed description will provide those skilled in the art with a convenient road map for implementing the exemplary embodiment or exemplary embodiments. It should be understood that various changes can be made in the function and arrangement of elements without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims and the legal equivalents thereof.
