This invention relates generally to products and services more particularly to systems and methods for cloud computing related services and products.

The advent of cloud based computing architectures has opened new possibilities for the rapid and scalable deployment of virtual Web stores media outlets and other on line sites or services. In general a cloud based architecture deploys a set of hosted resources such as processors operating systems software and other components that can be combined or strung together to form virtual machines. A user or customer can request the instantiation of a virtual machine or set of machines from those resources from a central server or management system to perform intended tasks or applications. For example a user may wish to set up and instantiate a virtual server from the cloud to create a storefront to market products or services on a temporary basis for instance to sell tickets to an upcoming sports or musical performance. The user can lease or subscribe to the set of resources needed to build and run the set of instantiated virtual machines on a comparatively short term basis such as hours or days for their intended application.

Whether in on premise or in a cloud virtual machines applications and appliances require identity management services. Identity management typically involves the management of information that identifies items users devices products services associated with systems such as the virtual machines applications or appliances. This identity management may involve management of such information such as a user s identity for access to the system e.g. login access security a user s identity or data maintained and provided by the system e.g. directory services a user s identity utilized by the system in processing e.g. tracking billing and data or devices associated with the system. Typically the owner or operator of the systems must purchase install and maintain the necessary infrastructure such as hardware and software to support the identity management services. Thus there is a need in the art for methods and system that provides identity management services without the need for owners or operators to purchase and maintain the infrastructure for the identity management services.

For simplicity and illustrative purposes the principles of the present invention are described by referring mainly to exemplary embodiments thereof. However one of ordinary skill in the art would readily recognize that the same principles are equally applicable to and can be implemented in all types of information and service portals and that any such variations do not depart from the true spirit and scope of the present invention. Moreover in the following detailed description references are made to the accompanying figures which illustrate specific embodiments. Electrical mechanical logical and structural changes may be made to the embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.

Embodiments of the present teachings relate to systems and methods for providing identity management services in a cloud computing environment. More particularly embodiments relate to platforms and techniques in which a identity management system can be configured to provide identity management services from within the cloud computing environment.

According to embodiments in general an identity management system can reside within the cloud computing environment. The identity management system can be linked to systems such as virtual machines applications and or appliances both inside and outside the cloud computing environment to provide identity management to those systems. In order to provide identity management the identity management system can be configured to link to the systems in order to receive store maintain and provide identity information. The information can identify items users devices products services associated with the systems. The identity management system can be configured to store and maintain the information in records. The identity management system can also be configured to charge the owners for the identity management.

By providing identity management from within the cloud an owner or operator can receive identity management for their systems on demand without the cost of purchasing and maintaining an identity management system.

In embodiments the entire set of resource servers or other hardware or software resources used to support the cloud along with its instantiated virtual machines is managed by a cloud management system . The cloud management system can comprise a dedicated or centralized server and or other software hardware and network tools that communicate via one or more networks such as the Internet or other public or private network with all sets of resource servers to manage the cloud and its operation. To instantiate a new set of virtual machines a user can transmit an instantiation request to the cloud management system for the particular type of virtual machine they wish to invoke for their intended application. A user can for instance make a request to instantiate a set of virtual machines configured for email messaging or other applications from the cloud . The request can be received and processed by the cloud management system which identifies the type of virtual machine process or other resource being requested. The cloud management system can then identify the collection of resources necessary to instantiate that machine or resource. In embodiments the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources can for example comprise virtual transaction servers used to support Web storefronts or other transaction sites.

In embodiments the user s instantiation request can specify a variety of parameters defining the operation of the set of virtual machines to be invoked. The instantiation request for example can specify a defined period of time for which the instantiated machine or process is needed. The period of time can be for example an hour a day or other increment of time. In embodiments the user s instantiation request can specify the instantiation of a set of virtual machines or processes on a task basis rather than for a predetermined amount of time. For instance a user could request resources until a software update is completed. The user s instantiation request can specify other parameters that define the configuration and operation of the set of virtual machines or other instantiated resources. For example the request can specify an amount of processing power or input output I O throughput the user wishes to be available to each instance of the virtual machine or other resource. In embodiments the requesting user can for instance specify a service level agreement SLA acceptable for their application. Other parameters and settings can be used. One skilled in the art will realize that the user s request can likewise include combinations of the foregoing exemplary parameters and others.

When the request to instantiate a set of virtual machines or other resources has been received and the necessary resources to build that machine or resource have been identified the cloud management system can communicate with one or more set of resource servers to locate resources to supply the required components. The cloud management system can select providers from the diverse set of resource servers to assemble the various components needed to build the requested set of virtual machines or other resources. It may be noted that in some embodiments permanent storage such as hard disk arrays may not be included or located within the set of resource servers available to the cloud management system since the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources may be intended to operate on a purely transient or temporary basis. In embodiments other hardware software or other resources not strictly located or hosted in the cloud can be leveraged as needed. For example other software services that are provided outside of the cloud and hosted by third parties can be invoked by in cloud virtual machines. For further example other non cloud hardware and or storage services can be utilized as an extension to the cloud either on an on demand or subscribed or decided basis.

With the resource requirements identified the cloud management system can extract and build the set of virtual machines or other resources on a dynamic or on demand basis. For example one set of resource servers may respond to an instantiation request for a given quantity of processor cycles with an offer to deliver that computational power immediately and guaranteed for the next hour. A further set of resource servers can offer to immediately supply communication bandwidth for example on a guaranteed minimum or best efforts basis. In other embodiments the set of virtual machines or other resources can be built on a batch basis or at a particular future time. For example a set of resource servers may respond to a request for instantiation at a programmed time with an offer to deliver the specified quantity of processor cycles within a specific amount of time such as the next 12 hours.

The cloud management system can select group of servers in the set of resource servers that match or best match the instantiation request for each component needed to build the virtual machine or other resource. The cloud management system can then coordinate the integration of the completed group of servers from the set of resource servers to build and launch the requested set of virtual machines or other resources. The cloud management system can track the combined group of servers selected from the set of resource servers or other distributed resources that are dynamically or temporarily combined to produce and manage the requested virtual machine population or other resources.

In embodiments the cloud management system can generate a resource aggregation table that identifies the various sets of resource servers that will be used to supply the components of the virtual machine or process. The sets of resource servers can be identified by unique identifiers such as for instance Internet protocol IP addresses or other addresses. The cloud management system can register the finalized group of servers in the set resource servers contributing to an instantiated machine or process.

The cloud management system can ten set up and launch the initiation process for the virtual machines processes or other resources to be delivered from the cloud. The cloud management system can for instance transmit an instantiation command or instruction to the registered group of servers in set of resource servers . The cloud management system can receive a confirmation message back from each participating server in set of resource servers indicating a status regarding the provisioning of their respective resources. Various sets of resource servers may confirm for example the availability of a dedicated amount of processor cycles amounts of electronic memory communications bandwidth or applications or other software prepared to be served.

As shown for example in the cloud management system can then instantiate one or more than one set of virtual machines or other processes based on the resources supplied by the registered set of resource servers . In embodiments the cloud management system can instantiate a given number for example 10 500 1000 or other numbers of virtual machines to be made available to users on a network such as the Internet or other public or private network. Each virtual machine can be assigned an instantiated machine ID that can be stored in the resource aggregation table or other record or image of the instantiated population. Additionally the cloud management system can store the duration of each virtual machine and the collection of resources utilized by the complete set of instantiated virtual machines .

In embodiments the cloud management system can further store track and manage a user s identity and associated set of rights or entitlements to software hardware and other resources. Each user that populates a set of virtual machines in the cloud can have specific rights and resources assigned and made available to them. The cloud management system can track and configure specific actions that a user can perform such as provision a set of virtual machines with software applications or other resources configure a set of virtual machines to desired specifications submit jobs to the set of virtual machines or other host manage other users of the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources and other privileges or actions. The cloud management system can further generate records of the usage of instantiated virtual machines to permit tracking billing and auditing of the services consumed by the user. In embodiments the cloud management system can for example meter the usage and or duration of the set of instantiated virtual machines to generate subscription billing records for a user that has launched those machines. Other billing or value arrangements are possible.

The cloud management system can configure each virtual machine to be made available to users of the one or more networks via a browser interface or other interface or mechanism. Each instantiated virtual machine can communicate with the cloud management system and the underlying registered set of resource servers via a standard Web application programming interface API or via other calls or interfaces. The set of instantiated virtual machines can likewise communicate with each other as well as other sites servers locations and resources available via the Internet or other public or private networks whether within a given cloud or between clouds.

It may be noted that while a browser interface or other front end can be used to view and operate the set of instantiated virtual machines from a client or terminal the processing memory communications storage and other hardware as well as software resources required to be combined to build the virtual machines or other resources are all hosted remotely in the cloud . In embodiments the set of virtual machines or other resources may not depend on or require the user s own on premise hardware or other resources. In embodiments a user can therefore request and instantiate a set of virtual machines or other resources on a purely off premise basis for instance to build and launch a virtual storefront or other application.

Because the cloud management system in one regard specifies builds operates and manages the set of instantiated virtual machines on a logical level the user can request and receive different sets of virtual machines and other resources on a real time or near real time basis without a need to specify or install any particular hardware. The user s set of instantiated virtual machines processes or other resources can be scaled up or down immediately or virtually immediately on an on demand basis if desired. In embodiments the various sets of resource servers that are accessed by the cloud management system to support a set of instantiated virtual machines or processes can change or be substituted over time. The type and operating characteristics of the set of instantiated virtual machines can nevertheless remain constant or virtually constant since instances are assembled from abstracted resources that can be selected and maintained from diverse sources based on uniform specifications.

In terms of network management of the set of instantiated virtual machines that have been successfully configured and instantiated the cloud management system can perform various network management tasks including security maintenance and metering for billing or subscription purposes. The cloud management system of a given cloud can for example install or terminate applications or appliances on individual machines. The cloud management system can monitor operating virtual machines to detect any virus or other rogue process on individual machines and for instance terminate the infected application or virtual machine. The cloud management system can likewise manage an entire set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources on a collective basis for instance to push or delivery a software upgrade to all active virtual machines. Other management processes are possible.

In embodiments more than one set of virtual machines can be instantiated in a given cloud at the same overlapping or successive times. The cloud management system can in such implementations build launch and manage multiple sets of virtual machines based on the same or different underlying set of resource servers with populations of different sets of instantiated virtual machines such as may be requested by different users. The cloud management system can institute and enforce security protocols in a cloud hosting multiple sets of virtual machines. Each of the individual sets of virtual machines can be hosted in a respective partition or sub cloud of the resources of the cloud . The cloud management system of a cloud can for example deploy services specific to isolated or defined sub clouds or isolate individual workloads processes within the cloud to a specific sub cloud. The subdivision of the cloud into distinct transient sub clouds or other sub components which have assured security and isolation features can assist in establishing a multiple user or multi tenant cloud arrangement. In a multiple user scenario each of the multiple users can use the cloud platform as a common utility while retaining the assurance that their information is secure from other users of the overall cloud system. In further embodiments sub clouds can nevertheless be configured to share resources if desired.

In embodiments and as also shown in the set of instantiated virtual machines generated in a first cloud can also interact with a set of instantiated virtual machines or processes generated in a second third or further cloud . The cloud management system of a first cloud can interface with the cloud management system of a second cloud to coordinate those domains and operate the clouds and or virtual machines or processes on a combined basis. The cloud management system of a given cloud can track and manage individual virtual machines or other resources instantiated in that cloud as well as the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources in other clouds.

In the foregoing and other embodiments the user making an instantiation request or otherwise accessing or utilizing the cloud network can be a person customer subscriber administrator corporation organization or other entity. In embodiments the user can be or include another virtual machine application or process. In further embodiments multiple users or entities can share the use of a set of virtual machines or other resources.

According to various embodiments the identity management service can be configured to communicate with the virtual machines via network in order to provide identity management to the virtual machines . Likewise the identity management service can be configured to communicate with on premise systems located outside of cloud via a secure network in order to provide identity management to the on premise systems .

According to various embodiments the identity management service is configured to provide identity management for the virtual machines and or on premise systems . This identity management may involve management of the virtual machines and or on premise systems contact with and utilization of information associated with the virtual machines and or on premise systems . For example the information can include a user s identity for access e.g. login access security a user s identity maintained and provided e.g. directory services a user s identity utilized by the system e.g. tracking billing data products and services provided and devices and resources associated with the virtual machines and or on premise systems .

For example if the virtual machines and or on premise systems are configured to execute Web storefronts the identity management service can be linked to the virtual machines and or on premise systems to create maintain and manage records for user s access to the Web storefronts and records of inventory and content available on the Web storefronts. This can include for example records of users accessing the Web storefront user s identity information login information billing and address information purchase and access history . This can also include for example records of the inventory and content provide by the Web storefronts lists of products and services available prices for products and services available inventory .

In embodiments to provide the identity management the identity management service includes an identity engine and an identity store . The identity engine includes the necessary control logic for performing the processes of identity management. In particular the identity engine can be configured to link with and communicate with the virtual machines and or on premise systems in order to receive to maintain to store and to provide the identity information maintained by the identity management service . To receive store maintain and provide the identity information the identity engine can be configured to create and maintain identity records of the information in identity store . The records containing the identity information can be created stored and maintained in identity store using any type of conventional protocols and formats such as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol LDAP .

In embodiments in order to create and maintain the identity records the identity engine can be configured to link and communicate with the virtual machines and or on premise systems using a unique identifier associated with the virtual machines and or on premise systems . The unique identifier can be Internet Protocol IP address a file certificate cookie or other identification object encoding a unique identifier identifying the particular the virtual machines or on premise systems . As such the identity engine can create and maintain the identity information records associated with the unique identifier for the particular virtual machines and or on premise systems with which the identity information is related. The virtual machines and or on premise systems can send or request identity information from the identity management service by referencing the identity information desired and the unique identifier.

In embodiments to maintain security and privacy the identity management service can be configured to communicate with on premise systems via a secure network . The secure network can be any type of private or secure public network connected to the identity management service and on premise systems . Likewise the secure network can be a virtual private network created across a network such as network using encryption protocols.

In embodiments the identity management service can be configured to charge owners of the virtual machines and or on premise systems for providing the identity management. The charge can be based on a number of factors including number of entries in identity records the size of identity records the number of requests from the virtual machines and or on premise systems the number of the virtual machines and or on premise systems linked to the identity management service a flat rate for identity management duration of identity management and combinations thereof.

To determine a charge the identity management service can maintain a list of rates based on the different factors and can maintain a record of the usage by a particular virtual machines and or on premise system . The identity management service can maintain the usage record associated with an identification of the owner or operator of the virtual machines and or on premise system along with the unique identifier. The cloud management system can utilize the usage record and rates list to bill the owner for the identity management. For example the identity engine can retrieve the usage records and rates list from identity store and calculate the charges. The identity management service can initiate a payment process via any electronic or physical payment process for the extracted fees. For example the management engine can generate a bill to be transmitted or can initiate automatic payment if the owner has provided payment information. The identity management service can perform the billing process on demand or in a periodic manner.

Other configurations of the identity management service associated network connections and other hardware and software resources are possible. Additionally because the identity management service resides in the cloud the identity management service can be implemented in a virtual machine in the cloud .

In the identity management system can initiate identity management and link the identity management to the virtual machines and or the on premise systems . For example the identity management system can obtain the unique identifier for the virtual machines and or the on premise systems and identifying information for the owner of the virtual machines and or the on premise systems . The unique identifier and identifying information can be received in the request or obtained from other sources such as the cloud management system . The identity records can then be created associated the unique identifier and identifying information.

After initiation in the identity management system can begin performing identity management. For example the identity management system can receive store maintain and provide identity information for the virtual machines and or the on premise systems . To receive store maintain and provide the identity information the identity management system can be configured to create and maintain identity records of the information. The records containing the identity information can be created stored and maintained using any type of conventional protocols and formats such as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol LDAP .

In the identity management system can determine charges for the identity management. To determine charges the identity management service can maintain a list of rates based the different factors and can maintain a record of the usage by a particular virtual machines and or on premise system . The identity management service can perform the billing process on demand or in a periodic manner.

Then in if the identity management terminates the process can end but the process can return to any point and repeat.

In the foregoing and other embodiments the user making an instantiation request or otherwise accessing the cloud network can be a person customer subscriber corporation organization or other entity. In embodiments the user can be or include another virtual machine application or process. In further embodiments multiple users or entities can share the use of a set of virtual machines or other resources.
