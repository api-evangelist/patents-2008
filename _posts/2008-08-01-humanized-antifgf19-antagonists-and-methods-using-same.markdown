FGF19 is a member of the most distant of the seven subfamilies of the FGFs. FGF19 is a high affinity ligand of FGFR4 Xie et al 1999 Cytokine 11 729 735 . FGF19 is normally secreted by the biliary and intestinal epithelium. FGF19 plays a role in cholesterol homeostasis by repressing hepatic expression of cholesterol 7 hydroxylase 1 Cyp7 1 the rate limiting enzyme for cholesterol and bile acid synthesis Gutierrez et al 2006 26 301 306 Yu et al 2000 275 15482 15489 Holt JA et al. 2003 17 130 158 .

It is clear that there continues to be a need for agents that have clinical attributes that are optimal for development as therapeutic agents. The invention described herein meets this need and provides other benefits.

All references cited herein including patent applications and publications are incorporated by reference in their entirety.

The invention is in part based on the identification of a variety of antagonists of the FGF19 FGFR4 pathway. FGF19 presents as an important and advantageous therapeutic target and the invention provides compositions and methods based on interfering with FGF19 FGFR4 activation including but not limited to interfering with FGF19 binding to FGFR4 extracellular domain. Antagonists of the invention as described herein provide important therapeutic and diagnostic agents for use in targeting pathological conditions associated with expression and or activity of the FGF19 FGFR4 pathway. Accordingly the invention provides methods compositions kits and articles of manufacture related to modulating the FGF19 FGFR4 pathway including modulation of FGF19 receptor binding activation and other biological physiological activities associated with FGF19 FGFR4 signaling.

For example in one embodiment the invention provides a humanized anti FGF19 antibody wherein the monovalent affinity of the antibody to human FGF19 e.g. affinity of the antibody as a Fab fragment to human FGF19 is substantially the same as the monovalent affinity of a murine antibody e.g. affinity of the murine antibody as a Fab fragment to human FGF19 or a chimeric antibody e.g. affinity of the chimeric antibody as a Fab fragment to human FGF19 comprising consisting or consisting essentially of a light chain and heavy chain variable domain sequence as depicted in . In another embodiment the invention provides a humanized anti FGF19 antibody wherein the monovalent affinity of the antibody to human FGF19 e.g. affinity of the antibody as a Fab fragment to human FGF19 is lower for example at least 3 5 7 or 10 fold lower than the monovalent affinity of a murine antibody e.g. affinity of the murine antibody as a Fab fragment to human FGF19 or a chimeric antibody e.g. affinity of the chimeric antibody as a Fab fragment to human FGF19 comprising consisting or consisting essentially of a light chain and heavy chain variable domain sequence as depicted in . In another embodiment the invention provides an anti FGF19 humanized antibody wherein the monovalent affinity of the antibody to human FGF19 e.g. affinity of the antibody as a Fab fragment to human FGF19 is greater for example at least 3 5 7 10 or 13 fold greater than the monovalent affinity of a murine antibody e.g. affinity of the murine antibody as a Fab fragment to human FGF19 or a chimeric antibody e.g. affinity of the chimeric antibody as a Fab fragment to human FGF19 comprising consisting or consisting essentially of a light chain and heavy chain variable domain sequence as depicted in . As is well established in the art binding affinity of a ligand to its receptor can be determined using any of a variety of assays and expressed in terms of a variety of quantitative values. Accordingly in one embodiment the binding affinity is expressed as Kd values and reflects intrinsic binding affinity e.g. with minimized avidity effects . Generally and preferably binding affinity is measured in vitro whether in a cell free or cell associated setting. As described in greater detail herein fold difference in binding affinity can be quantified in terms of the ratio of the monovalent binding affinity value of a humanized antibody e.g. in Fab form and the monovalent binding affinity value of a reference comparator antibody e.g. in Fab form e.g. a murine antibody having donor hypervariable region sequences wherein the binding affinity values are determined under similar assay conditions. Thus in one embodiment the fold difference in binding affinity is determined as the ratio of the Kd values of the humanized antibody in Fab form and said reference comparator Fab antibody. For example in one embodiment if an antibody of the invention A has an affinity that is 3 fold lower than the affinity of a reference antibody M then if the Kd value for A is 3 the Kd value of M would be 1 and the ratio of Kd of A to Kd of M would be 3 1. Conversely in one embodiment if an antibody of the invention C has an affinity that is 3 fold greater than the affinity of a reference antibody R then if the Kd value for C is 1 the Kd value of R would be 3 and the ratio of Kd of C to Kd of R would be 1 3. Any of a number of assays known in the art including those described herein can be used to obtain binding affinity measurements including for example Biacore radioimmunoassay RIA and ELISA.

The techniques and procedures described or referenced herein are generally well understood and commonly employed using conventional methodology by those skilled in the art such as for example the widely utilized methodologies described in Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual 3rd. edition 2001 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY F. M. Ausubel et al. eds. 2003 the series METHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY Academic Press Inc. PCR 2 A PRACTICAL APPROACH M. J. MacPherson B. D. Hames and G. R.

An isolated antibody is one which has been identified and separated and or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody and may include enzymes hormones and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments the antibody will be purified 1 to greater than 95 by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method and most preferably more than 99 by weight 2 to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator or 3 to homogeneity by SDS PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or preferably silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody s natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily however isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.

An isolated nucleic acid molecule is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the natural source of the antibody nucleic acid. An isolated nucleic acid molecule is other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature. Isolated nucleic acid molecules therefore are distinguished from the nucleic acid molecule as it exists in natural cells. However an isolated nucleic acid molecule includes a nucleic acid molecule contained in cells that ordinarily express the antibody where for example the nucleic acid molecule is in a chromosomal location different from that of natural cells.

The term anti FGF19 antibody or an antibody that binds to FGF19 refers to an antibody that is capable of binding FGF19 with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful as a diagnostic and or therapeutic agent in targeting FGF19. Preferably the extent of binding of an anti FGF19 antibody to an unrelated non FGF19 protein is less than about 10 of the binding of the antibody to FGF19 as measured e.g. by a radioimmunoassay RIA . In certain embodiments an antibody that binds to FGF19 has a dissociation constant Kd of 1 M 100 nM 10 nM 1 nM or 0.1 nM. In certain embodiments an anti FGF19 antibody binds to an epitope of FGF19 that is conserved among FGF19 from different species.

 Binding affinity generally refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule e.g. an antibody and its binding partner e.g. an antigen . Unless indicated otherwise as used herein binding affinity refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1 1 interaction between members of a binding pair e.g. antibody and antigen . The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant Kd . Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art including those described herein. Low affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily whereas high affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art any of which can be used for purposes of the present invention. Specific illustrative embodiments are described in the following.

In one embodiment the Kd or Kd value according to this invention is measured by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay RIA performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen as described by the following assay that measures solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of I labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen then capturing bound antigen with an anti Fab antibody coated plate Chen et al. 1999 J. Mol Biol 293 865 881 . To establish conditions for the assay microtiter plates Dynex are coated overnight with 5 ug ml of a capturing anti Fab antibody Cappel Labs in 50 mM sodium carbonate pH 9.6 and subsequently blocked with 2 w v bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature approximately 23 C. . In a non adsorbant plate Nunc 269620 100 M or 26 pM I antigen antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest e.g. consistent with assessment of an anti VEGF antibody Fab 12 in Presta et al. 1997 Cancer Res. 57 4593 4599 . The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight however the incubation may continue for a longer period e.g. 65 hours to insure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature e.g. for one hour . The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1 Tween 20 in PBS. When the plates have dried 150 ul well of scintillant MicroScint 20 Packard is added and the plates are counted on a Topcount gamma counter Packard for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20 of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays. According to another embodiment the Kd or Kd value is measured by using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIAcore 2000 or a BIAcore 3000 BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. at 25 C with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at 10 response units RU . Briefly carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips CM5 BIAcore Inc. are activated with N ethyl N 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride EDC and N hydroxysuccinimide NHS according to the supplier s instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.8 into 5 ug ml 0.2 uM before injection at a flow rate of 5 ul minute to achieve approximately 10 response units RU of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen 1M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements two fold serial dilutions of Fab 0.78 nM to 500 nM are injected in PBS with 0.05 Tween 20 PBST at 25 C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 ul min. Association rates k and dissociation rates k are calculated using a simple one to one Langmuir binding model BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2 by simultaneous fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. The equilibrium dissociation constant Kd is calculated as the ratio k k. See e.g. Chen Y. et al. 1999 J. Mol Biol 293 865 881. If the on rate exceeds 10MSby the surface plasmon resonance assay above then the on rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity excitation 295 nm emission 340 nm 16 nm band pass at 25 C. of a 20 nM anti antigen antibody Fab form in PBS pH 7.2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer such as a stop flow equipped spectrophometer Aviv Instruments or a 8000 series SLM Aminco spectrophotometer ThermoSpectronic with a stirred cuvette.

An on rate or rate of association or association rate or k according to this invention can also be determined with the same surface plasmon resonance technique described above using a BIAcore 2000 or a BIAcore 3000 BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. at 25 C with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at 10 response units RU . Briefly carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips CM5 BIAcore Inc. are activated with N ethyl N 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride EDC and N hydroxysuccinimide NHS according to the supplier s instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.8 into 5 ug ml 0.2 uM before injection at a flow rate of 5 ul minute to achieve approximately 10 response units RU of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen 1M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements two fold serial dilutions of Fab 0.78 nM to 500 nM are injected in PBS with 0.05 Tween 20 PBST at 25 C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 ul min. Association rates k and dissociation rates k are calculated using a simple one to one Langmuir binding model BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2 by simultaneous fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. The equilibrium dissociation constant Kd was calculated as the ratio k k. See e.g. Chen Y. et al. 1999 J. Mol Biol 293 865 881. However if the on rate exceeds 10MSby the surface plasmon resonance assay above then the on rate is preferably determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity excitation 295 nm emission 340 nm 16 nm band pass at 25 C. of a 20 nM anti antigen antibody Fab form in PBS pH 7.2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a a spectrometer such as a stop flow equipped spectrophometer Aviv Instruments or a 8000 series SLM Aminco spectrophotometer ThermoSpectronic with a stirred cuvette.

The term vector as used herein is intended to refer to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a plasmid which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments may be ligated. Another type of vector is a phage vector. Another type of vector is a viral vector wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced e.g. bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors . Other vectors e.g. non episomal mammalian vectors can be integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as recombinant expression vectors or simply recombinant vectors . In general expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification plasmid and vector may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector.

 Polynucleotide or nucleic acid as used interchangeably herein refer to polymers of nucleotides of any length and include DNA and RNA. The nucleotides can be deoxyribonucleotides ribonucleotides modified nucleotides or bases and or their analogs or any substrate that can be incorporated into a polymer by DNA or RNA polymerase or by a synthetic reaction. A polynucleotide may comprise modified nucleotides such as methylated nucleotides and their analogs. If present modification to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or after assembly of the polymer. The sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non nucleotide components. A polynucleotide may be further modified after synthesis such as by conjugation with a label. Other types of modifications include for example caps substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog internucleotide modifications such as for example those with uncharged linkages e.g. methyl phosphonates phosphotriesters phosphoamidates carbamates etc. and with charged linkages e.g. phosphorothioates phosphorodithioates etc. those containing pendant moieties such as for example proteins e.g. nucleases toxins antibodies signal peptides ply L lysine etc. those with intercalators e.g. acridine psoralen etc. those containing chelators e.g. metals radioactive metals boron oxidative metals etc. those containing alkylators those with modified linkages e.g. alpha anomeric nucleic acids etc. as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotide s . Further any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in the sugars may be replaced for example by phosphonate groups phosphate groups protected by standard protecting groups or activated to prepare additional linkages to additional nucleotides or may be conjugated to solid or semi solid supports. The 5 and 3 terminal OH can be phosphorylated or substituted with amines or organic capping group moieties of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Other hydroxyls may also be derivatized to standard protecting groups. Polynucleotides can also contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are generally known in the art including for example 2 O methyl 2 O allyl 2 fluoro or 2 azido ribose carbocyclic sugar analogs alpha anomeric sugars epimeric sugars such as arabinose xyloses or lyxoses pyranose sugars furanose sugars sedoheptuloses acyclic analogs and a basic nucleoside analogs such as methyl riboside. One or more phosphodiester linkages may be replaced by alternative linking groups. These alternative linking groups include but are not limited to embodiments wherein phosphate is replaced by P O S thioate P S S dithioate O NR amidate P O R P O OR CO or CH formacetal in which each R or R is independently H or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl 1 20 C optionally containing an ether O linkage aryl alkenyl cycloalkyl cycloalkenyl or araldyl. Not all linkages in a polynucleotide need be identical. The preceding description applies to all polynucleotides referred to herein including RNA and DNA.

 Oligonucleotide as used herein generally refers to short generally single stranded generally synthetic polynucleotides that are generally but not necessarily less than about 200 nucleotides in length. The terms oligonucleotide and polynucleotide are not mutually exclusive. The description above for polynucleotides is equally and fully applicable to oligonucleotides.

The term FGF19 interchangeably termed Fibroblast growth factor 19 as used herein refers unless specifically or contextually indicated otherwise to any native or variant whether native or synthetic FGF19 polypeptide. The term native sequence specifically encompasses naturally occurring truncated or secreted forms e.g. an extracellular domain sequence naturally occurring variant forms e.g. alternatively spliced forms and naturally occurring allelic variants. The term wild type FGF19 generally refers to a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring FGF19 protein. The term wild type FGF19 sequence generally refers to an amino acid sequence found in a naturally occurring FGF19.

The term FGFR4 interchangeably termed Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 as used herein refers unless specifically or contextually indicated otherwise to any native or variant whether native or synthetic FGFR4 polypeptide. The term native sequence specifically encompasses naturally occurring truncated or secreted forms e.g. an extracellular domain sequence naturally occurring variant forms e.g. alternatively spliced forms and naturally occurring allelic variants. The term wild type FGFR4 generally refers to a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring FGFR4 protein. The term wild type FGFR4 sequence generally refers to an amino acid sequence found in a naturally occurring FGFR4.

The terms antibody and immunoglobulin are used interchangeably in the broadest sense and include monoclonal antibodies for e.g. full length or intact monoclonal antibodies polyclonal antibodies multivalent antibodies multispecific antibodies e.g. bispecific antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity and may also include certain antibody fragments as described in greater detail herein . An antibody can be human humanized and or affinity matured.

The term variable refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called complementarity determining regions HVRs or hypervariable regions both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework FR . The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions largely adopting a sheet configuration connected by three HVRs which form loops connecting and in some cases forming part of the sheet structure. The HVRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and with the HVRs from the other chain contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies see Kabat et al. Fifth Edition National Institute of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen but exhibit various effector functions such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular toxicity.

Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen binding fragments called Fab fragments each with a single antigen binding site and a residual Fc fragment whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F ab fragment that has two antigen combining sites and is still capable of cross linking antigen.

 Fv is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen recognition and binding site. In a two chain Fv species this region consists of a dimer of one heavy and one light chain variable domain in tight non covalent association. In a single chain Fv species one heavy and one light chain variable domain can be covalently linked by a flexible peptide linker such that the light and heavy chains can associate in a dimeric structure analogous to that in a two chain Fv species. It is in this configuration that the three HVRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen binding site on the surface of the VH VL dimer. Collectively the six HVRs confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However even a single variable domain or half of an Fv comprising only three HVRs specific for an antigen has the ability to recognize and bind antigen although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.

The Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain CH1 of the heavy chain. Fab fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab SH is the designation herein for Fab in which the cysteine residue s of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F ab antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.

The light chains of antibodies immunoglobulins from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types called kappa and lambda based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.

Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins IgA IgD IgE IgG and IgM and several of these can be further divided into subclasses isotypes e.g. IgG IgG IgG IgG IgA and IgA. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called and respectively. The subunit structures and three dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.

 Antibody fragments comprise only a portion of an intact antibody wherein the portion preferably retains at least one preferably most or all of the functions normally associated with that portion when present in an intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab Fab F ab 2 and Fv fragments diabodies linear antibodies single chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. In one embodiment an antibody fragment comprises an antigen binding site of the intact antibody and thus retains the ability to bind antigen. In another embodiment an antibody fragment for example one that comprises the Fc region retains at least one of the biological functions normally associated with the Fc region when present in an intact antibody such as FcRn binding antibody half life modulation ADCC function and complement binding. In one embodiment an antibody fragment is a monovalent antibody that has an in vivo half life substantially similar to an intact antibody. For e.g. such an antibody fragment may comprise on antigen binding arm linked to an Fc sequence capable of conferring in vivo stability to the fragment.

The term hypervariable region HVR or HV when used herein refers to the regions of an antibody variable domain which are hypervariable in sequence and or form structurally defined loops. Generally antibodies comprise six HVRs three in the VH H1 H2 H3 and three in the VL L1 L2 L3 . In native antibodies H3 and L3 display the most diversity of the six HVRs and H3 in particular is believed to play a unique role in conferring fine specificity to antibodies. See e.g. Xu et al. 13 37 45 2000 Johnson and Wu in 248 1 25 Lo ed. Human Press Totowa N.J. 2003 . Indeed naturally occurring camelid antibodies consisting of a heavy chain only are functional and stable in the absence of light chain. See e.g. Hamers Casterman et al. 363 446 448 1993 Sheriff et al. 3 733 736 1996 .

A number of HVR delineations are in use and are encompassed herein. The Kabat Complementarity Determining Regions CDRs are based on sequence variability and are the most commonly used Kabat et al. 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . Chothia refers instead to the location of the structural loops Chothia and Lesk 196 901 917 1987 . The AbM HVRs represent a compromise between the Kabat HVRs and Chothia structural loops and are used by Oxford Molecular s AbM antibody modeling software. The contact HVRs are based on an analysis of the available complex crystal structures. The residues from each of these HVRs are noted below.

HVRs may comprise extended HVRs as follows 24 36 or 24 34 L1 46 56 or 50 56 L2 and 89 97 or 89 96 L3 in the VL and 26 35 H1 50 65 or 49 65 H2 and 93 102 94 102 or 95 102 H3 in the VH. The variable domain residues are numbered according to Kabat et al. supra for each of these definitions.

 Framework or FR residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined.

 Humanized forms of non human e.g. murine antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulin. In one embodiment a humanized antibody is a human immunoglobulin recipient antibody in which residues from a HVR of the recipient are replaced by residues from a HVR of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity affinity and or capacity. In some instances FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues. Furthermore humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications may be made to further refine antibody performance. In general a humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details see e.g. Jones et al. 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. 332 323 329 1988 and Presta 2 593 596 1992 . See also e.g. Vaswani and Hamilton 1 105 115 1998 Harris 23 1035 1038 1995 Hurle and Gross 5 428 433 1994 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 982 321 and 7 087 409.

The term monoclonal antibody as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible mutations e.g. naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Thus the modifier monoclonal indicates the character of the antibody as not being a mixture of discrete antibodies. In certain embodiments such a monoclonal antibody typically includes an antibody comprising a polypeptide sequence that binds a target wherein the target binding polypeptide sequence was obtained by a process that includes the selection of a single target binding polypeptide sequence from a plurality of polypeptide sequences. For example the selection process can be the selection of a unique clone from a plurality of clones such as a pool of hybridoma clones phage clones or recombinant DNA clones. It should be understood that a selected target binding sequence can be further altered for example to improve affinity for the target to humanize the target binding sequence to improve its production in cell culture to reduce its immunogenicity in vivo to create a multispecific antibody etc. and that an antibody comprising the altered target binding sequence is also a monoclonal antibody of this invention. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants epitopes each monoclonal antibody of a monoclonal antibody preparation is directed against a single determinant on an antigen. In addition to their specificity monoclonal antibody preparations are advantageous in that they are typically uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins.

The modifier monoclonal indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques including for example the hybridoma method e.g. Kohler and Milstein 256 495 97 1975 Hongo et al. 14 3 253 260 1995 Harlow et al.

The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include chimeric antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while the remainder of the chain s is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass as well as fragments of such antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al. 81 6851 6855 1984 . Chimeric antibodies include PRIMATIZED antibodies wherein the antigen binding region of the antibody is derived from an antibody produced by e.g. immunizing macaque monkeys with the antigen of interest.

 Single chain Fv or scFv antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL domains of antibody wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally the scFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv see Pluckthun in vol. 113 Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer Verlag New York pp. 269 315 1994 .

An antigen is a predetermined antigen to which an antibody can selectively bind. The target antigen may be polypeptide carbohydrate nucleic acid lipid hapten or other naturally occurring or synthetic compound. Preferably the target antigen is a polypeptide.

The term diabodies refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen binding sites which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain VH connected to a light chain variable domain VL in the same polypeptide chain VH VL . By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in for example EP 404 097 WO 93 11161 and Hollinger et al. 90 6444 6448 1993 . Triabodies and tetrabodies are also described in Hudson et al. 9 129 134 2003 .

A human antibody is one which possesses an amino acid sequence which corresponds to that of an antibody produced by a human and or has been made using any of the techniques for making human antibodies as disclosed herein. This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non human antigen binding residues. Human antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the art including phage display libraries. Hoogenboom and Winter 227 381 1991 Marks et al. 222 581 1991 . Also available for the preparation of human monoclonal antibodies are methods described in Cole et al. Alan R. Liss p. 77 1985 Boerner et al. 147 1 86 95 1991 . See also van Dijk and van de Winkel 5 368 74 2001 . Human antibodies can be prepared by administering the antigen to a transgenic animal that has been modified to produce such antibodies in response to antigenic challenge but whose endogenous loci have been disabled e.g. immunized xenomice see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 075 181 and 6 150 584 regarding XENOMOUSE technology . See also for example Li et al. 103 3557 3562 2006 regarding human antibodies generated via a human B cell hybridoma technology.

The term variable domain residue numbering as in Kabat or amino acid position numbering as in Kabat and variations thereof refers to the numbering system used for heavy chain variable domains or light chain variable domains of the compilation of antibodies in Kabat et al. supra. Using this numbering system the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of or insertion into a FR or HVR of the variable domain. For example a heavy chain variable domain may include a single amino acid insert residue 52a according to Kabat after residue 52 of H2 and inserted residues e.g. residues 82a 82b and 82c etc. according to Kabat after heavy chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a standard Kabat numbered sequence.

The Kabat numbering system is generally used when referring to a residue in the variable domain approximately residues 1 107 of the light chain and residues 1 113 of the heavy chain e.g Kabat et al. 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . The EU numbering system or EU index is generally used when referring to a residue in an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region e.g. the EU index reported in Kabat et al. supra . The EU index as in Kabat refers to the residue numbering of the human IgG1 EU antibody. Unless stated otherwise herein references to residue numbers in the variable domain of antibodies means residue numbering by the Kabat numbering system. Unless stated otherwise herein references to residue numbers in the constant domain of antibodies means residue numbering by the EU numbering system e.g. see U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 640 323 Figures for EU numbering .

An affinity matured antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more HVRs thereof which result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those alteration s . In one embodiment an affinity matured antibody has nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies may be produced using certain procedures known in the art. For example Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of HVR and or framework residues is described by for example Barbas et al. 91 3809 3813 1994 Schier et al. 169 147 155 1995 Yelton et al. 155 1994 2004 1995 Jackson et al. 154 7 3310 9 1995 and Hawkins et al 226 889 896 1992 .

A blocking antibody or an antagonist antibody is one which inhibits or reduces biological activity of the antigen it binds. Certain blocking antibodies or antagonist antibodies substantially or completely inhibit the biological activity of the antigen.

An agonist antibody as used herein is an antibody which partially or fully mimics at least one of the functional activities of a polypeptide of interest.

The term substantially similar or substantially the same as used herein denotes a sufficiently high degree of similarity between two numeric values for example one associated with an antibody of the invention and the other associated with a reference comparator antibody such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of little or no biological and or statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values e.g. Kd values . The difference between said two values is for example less than about 50 less than about 40 less than about 30 less than about 20 and or less than about 10 as a function of the reference comparator value.

The phrase substantially reduced or substantially different as used herein denotes a sufficiently high degree of difference between two numeric values generally one associated with a molecule and the other associated with a reference comparator molecule such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values e.g. Kd values . The difference between said two values is for example greater than about 10 greater than about 20 greater than about 30 greater than about 40 and or greater than about 50 as a function of the value for the reference comparator molecule.

Antibody effector functions refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region of an antibody and vary with the antibody isotype. Examples of antibody effector functions include C1q binding and complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC Fc receptor binding antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC phagocytosis down regulation of cell surface receptors e.g. B cell receptor and B cell activation.

The term Fc region herein is used to define a C terminal region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain including native sequence Fc regions and variant Fc regions. Although the boundaries of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain might vary the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to stretch from an amino acid residue at position Cys226 or from Pro230 to the carboxyl terminus thereof. The C terminal lysine residue 447 according to the EU numbering system of the Fc region may be removed for example during production or purification of the antibody or by recombinantly engineering the nucleic acid encoding a heavy chain of the antibody. Accordingly a composition of intact antibodies may comprise antibody populations with all K447 residues removed antibody populations with no K447 residues removed and antibody populations having a mixture of antibodies with and without the K447 residue.

A functional Fc region possesses an effector function of a native sequence Fc region. Exemplary effector functions include C1q binding CDC Fc receptor binding ADCC phagocytosis down regulation of cell surface receptors e.g. B cell receptor BCR etc. Such effector functions generally require the Fc region to be combined with a binding domain e.g. an antibody variable domain and can be assessed using various assays as disclosed for example in definitions herein.

A native sequence Fc region comprises an amino acid sequence identical to the amino acid sequence of an Fc region found in nature. Native sequence human Fc regions include a native sequence human IgG1 Fc region non A and A allotypes native sequence human IgG2 Fc region native sequence human IgG3 Fc region and native sequence human IgG4 Fc region as well as naturally occurring variants thereof.

A variant Fc region comprises an amino acid sequence which differs from that of a native sequence Fc region by virtue of at least one amino acid modification preferably one or more amino acid substitution s . Preferably the variant Fc region has at least one amino acid substitution compared to a native sequence Fc region or to the Fc region of a parent polypeptide e.g. from about one to about ten amino acid substitutions and preferably from about one to about five amino acid substitutions in a native sequence Fc region or in the Fc region of the parent polypeptide. The variant Fc region herein will preferably possess at least about 80 homology with a native sequence Fc region and or with an Fc region of a parent polypeptide and most preferably at least about 90 homology therewith more preferably at least about 95 homology therewith.

 Fc receptor or FcR describes a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. In some embodiments an FcR is a native human FcR. In some embodiments an FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody a gamma receptor and includes receptors of the Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII subclasses including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of those receptors. Fc RII receptors include Fc RIIA an activating receptor and Fc RIIB an inhibiting receptor which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor Fc RIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif ITAM in its cytoplasmic domain Inhibiting receptor Fc RIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibition motif ITIM in its cytoplasmic domain. see e.g. Da ron 15 203 234 1997 . FcRs are reviewed for example in Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 92 1991 Capel et al. 4 25 34 1994 and de Haas et al. 126 330 41 1995 . Other FcRs including those to be identified in the future are encompassed by the term FcR herein.

The term Fc receptor or FcR also includes the neonatal receptor FcRn which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus Guyer et al. 117 587 1976 and Kim et al. 24 249 1994 and regulation of homeostasis of immunoglobulins. Methods of measuring binding to FcRn are known see e.g. Ghetie and Ward. 18 12 592 598 1997 Ghetie et al. 15 7 637 640 1997 Hinton et al. 279 8 6213 6216 2004 WO 2004 92219 Hinton et al. .

Binding to human FcRn in vivo and serum half life of human FcRn high affinity binding polypeptides can be assayed e.g. in transgenic mice or transfected human cell lines expressing human FcRn or in primates to which the polypeptides with a variant Fc region are administered. WO 2000 42072 Presta describes antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs. See also e.g. Shields et al. 9 2 6591 6604 2001 .

 Human effector cells are leukocytes which express one or more FcRs and perform effector functions. In certain embodiments the cells express at least Fc RIII and perform ADCC effector function s . Examples of human leukocytes which mediate ADCC include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC natural killer NK cells monocytes cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils. The effector cells may be isolated from a native source e.g. from blood.

 Antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity or ADCC refers to a form of cytotoxicity in which secreted Ig bound onto Fc receptors FcRs present on certain cytotoxic cells e.g. NK cells neutrophils and macrophages enable these cytotoxic effector cells to bind specifically to an antigen bearing target cell and subsequently kill the target cell with cytotoxins. The primary cells for mediating ADCC NK cells express Fc RIII only whereas monocytes express Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 92 1991 . To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest an in vitro ADCC assay such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 500 362 or 5 821 337 or U.S. Pat. No. 6 737 056 Presta may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include PBMC and NK cells. Alternatively or additionally ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo e.g. in an animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. 95 652 656 1998 .

 Complement dependent cytotoxicity or CDC refers to the lysis of a target cell in the presence of complement. Activation of the classical complement pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system C1q to antibodies of the appropriate subclass which are bound to their cognate antigen. To assess complement activation a CDC assay e.g. as described in Gazzano Santoro et al. 202 163 1996 may be performed. Polypeptide variants with altered Fc region amino acid sequences polypeptides with a variant Fc region and increased or decreased C1q binding capability are described e.g. in U.S. Pat. No. 6 194 551 B1 and WO 1999 51642. See also e.g. Idusogie et al. 164 4178 4184 2000 .

The term Fc region comprising antibody refers to an antibody that comprises an Fc region. The C terminal lysine residue 447 according to the EU numbering system of the Fc region may be removed for example during purification of the antibody or by recombinant engineering of the nucleic acid encoding the antibody. Accordingly a composition comprising an antibody having an Fc region according to this invention can comprise an antibody with K447 with all K447 removed or a mixture of antibodies with and without the K447 residue.

An acceptor human framework for the purposes herein is a framework comprising the amino acid sequence of a VL or VH framework derived from a human immunoglobulin framework or from a human consensus framework.

Where pre existing amino acid changes are present preferably no more than 5 and preferably 4 or less or 3 or less pre existing amino acid changes are present. Where pre existing amino acid changes are present in a VH preferably those changes are only at three two or one of positions 71H 73H and 78H for instance the amino acid residues at those positions may be 71A 73T and or 78A. In one embodiment the VL acceptor human framework is identical in sequence to the VL human immunoglobulin framework sequence or human consensus framework sequence.

A human consensus framework is a framework which represents the most commonly occurring amino acid residue in a selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH framework sequences. Generally the selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH sequences is from a subgroup of variable domain sequences. Generally the subgroup of sequences is a subgroup as in Kabat et al. In one embodiment for the VL the subgroup is subgroup kappa I as in Kabat et al. In one embodiment for the VH the subgroup is subgroup III as in Kabat et al.

The term wasting disorders e.g. wasting syndrome cachexia sarcopenia refers to a disorder caused by undesirable and or unhealthy loss of weight or loss of body cell mass. In the elderly as well as in AIDS and cancer patients wasting disease can result in undesired loss of body weight including both the fat and the fat free compartments. Wasting diseases can be the result of inadequate intake of food and or metabolic changes related to illness and or the aging process. Cancer patients and AIDS patients as well as patients following extensive surgery or having chronic infections immunologic diseases hyperthyroidism Crohn s disease psychogenic disease chronic heart failure or other severe trauma frequently suffer from wasting disease which is sometimes also referred to as cachexia a metabolic and sometimes an eating disorder. Cachexia is additionally characterized by hypermetabolism and hypercatabolism. Although cachexia and wasting disease are frequently used interchangeably to refer to wasting conditions there is at least one body of research which differentiates cachexia from wasting syndrome as a loss of fat free mass and particularly body cell mass Mayer 1999 J. Nutr. 129 1S Suppl. 2565 2595 . Sarcopenia yet another such disorder which can affect the aging individual is typically characterized by loss of muscle mass. End stage wasting disease as described above can develop in individuals suffering from either cachexia or sarcopenia.

A growth inhibitory agent when used herein refers to a compound or composition which inhibits growth of a cell such as a cell expressing FGF19 either in vitro or in vivo. Thus the growth inhibitory agent may be one which significantly reduces the percentage of cells such as a cell expressing FGF19 in S phase. Examples of growth inhibitory agents include agents that block cell cycle progression at a place other than S phase such as agents that induce G1 arrest and M phase arrest. Classical M phase blockers include the vincas vincristine and vinblastine taxanes and topoisomerase II inhibitors such as doxorubicin epirubicin daunorubicin etoposide and bleomycin. Those agents that arrest G1 also spill over into S phase arrest for example DNA alkylating agents such as tamoxifen prednisone dacarbazine mechlorethamine cisplatin methotrexate 5 fluorouracil and ara C. Further information can be found in Mendelsohn and Israel eds. Chapter 1 entitled Cell cycle regulation oncogenes and antineoplastic drugs by Murakami et al. W.B. Saunders Philadelphia 1995 e.g. p. 13. The taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel are anticancer drugs both derived from the yew tree. Docetaxel TAXOTERE Rhone Poulenc Rorer derived from the European yew is a semisynthetic analogue of paclitaxel TAXOL Bristol Myers Squibb . Paclitaxel and docetaxel promote the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilize microtubules by preventing depolymerization which results in the inhibition of mitosis in cells.

 Doxorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic. The full chemical name of doxorubicin is 8S cis 10 3 amino 2 3 6 trideoxy L lyxo hexapyranosyl oxy 7 8 9 10 tetrahydro 6 8 11 trihydroxy 8 hydroxyacetyl 1 methoxy 5 12 naphthacenedione.

The term Fc region comprising polypeptide refers to a polypeptide such as an antibody or immunoadhesin see definitions below which comprises an Fc region. The C terminal lysine residue 447 according to the EU numbering system of the Fc region may be removed for example during purification of the polypeptide or by recombinant engineering the nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide. Accordingly a composition comprising a polypeptide having an Fc region according to this invention can comprise polypeptides with K447 with all K447 removed or a mixture of polypeptides with and without the K447 residue.

Reduction or elimination of a HAMA response is a significant aspect of clinical development of suitable therapeutic agents. See e.g. Khaxzaeli et al. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1988 80 937 Jaffers et al. Transplantation 1986 41 572 Shawler et al. J. Immunol. 1985 135 1530 Sears et al. J. Biol. Response Mod. 1984 3 138 Miller et al. Blood 1983 62 988 Hakimi et al. J. Immunol. 1991 147 1352 Reichmann et al. Nature 1988 332 323 Junghans et al. Cancer Res. 1990 50 1495. As described herein the invention provides antibodies that are humanized such that HAMA response is reduced or eliminated. Variants of these antibodies can further be obtained using routine methods known in the art some of which are further described below.

For example an amino acid sequence from an antibody as described herein can serve as a starting parent sequence for diversification of the framework and or hypervariable sequence s . A selected framework sequence to which a starting hypervariable sequence is linked is referred to herein as an acceptor human framework. While the acceptor human frameworks may be from or derived from a human immunoglobulin the VL and or VH regions thereof preferably the acceptor human frameworks are from or derived from a human consensus framework sequence as such frameworks have been demonstrated to have minimal or no immunogenicity in human patients.

Where the acceptor is derived from a human immunoglobulin one may optionally select a human framework sequence that is selected based on its homology to the donor framework sequence by aligning the donor framework sequence with various human framework sequences in a collection of human framework sequences and select the most homologous framework sequence as the acceptor.

In one embodiment human consensus frameworks herein are from or derived from VH subgroup III and or VL kappa subgroup I consensus framework sequences.

Thus the VH acceptor human framework may comprise one two three or all of the following framework sequences 

FR3 comprising FR3 comprises RFTISX1DX2SKNTX3YLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYC SEQ ID NO 50 wherein X1 is A or R X2 is T or N and X3 is A or L

human VH acceptor framework minus extended hypervariable regions SEQ ID NOS 46 47 266 49 46 47 265 49 and 46 47 270 49 respectively in order of appearance 

In one embodiment the VH acceptor human framework comprises one two three or all of the following framework sequences 

The VL acceptor human framework may comprise one two three or all of the following framework sequences 

While the acceptor may be identical in sequence to the human framework sequence selected whether that is from a human immunoglobulin or a human consensus framework the present invention contemplates that the acceptor sequence may comprise pre existing amino acid substitutions relative to the human immunoglobulin sequence or human consensus framework sequence. These pre existing substitutions are preferably minimal usually four three two or one amino acid differences only relative to the human immunoglobulin sequence or consensus framework sequence.

Hypervariable region residues of the non human antibody are incorporated into the VL and or VH acceptor human frameworks. For example one may incorporate residues corresponding to the Kabat CDR residues the Chothia hypervariable loop residues the Abm residues and or contact residues. Optionally the extended hypervariable region residues as follows are incorporated 24 34 L1 50 56 L2 and 89 97 L3 26 35 H1 50 65 or 49 65 H2 and 93 102 94 102 or 95 102 H3 .

While incorporation of hypervariable region residues is discussed herein it will be appreciated that this can be achieved in various ways for example nucleic acid encoding the desired amino acid sequence can be generated by mutating nucleic acid encoding the mouse variable domain sequence so that the framework residues thereof are changed to acceptor human framework residues or by mutating nucleic acid encoding the human variable domain sequence so that the hypervariable domain residues are changed to non human residues or by synthesizing nucleic acid encoding the desired sequence etc.

In the examples herein hypervariable region grafted variants were generated by Kunkel mutagenesis of nucleic acid encoding the human acceptor sequences using a separate oligonucleotide for each hypervariable region. Kunkel et al. 154 367 382 1987 . Appropriate changes can be introduced within the framework and or hypervariable region using routine techniques to correct and re establish proper hypervariable region antigen interactions.

Phage mid display also referred to herein as phage display in some contexts can be used as a convenient and fast method for generating and screening many different potential variant antibodies in a library generated by sequence randomization. However other methods for making and screening altered antibodies are available to the skilled person.

Phage mid display technology has provided a powerful tool for generating and selecting novel proteins which bind to a ligand such as an antigen. Using the techniques of phage mid display allows the generation of large libraries of protein variants which can be rapidly sorted for those sequences that bind to a target molecule with high affinity. Nucleic acids encoding variant polypeptides are generally fused to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a viral coat protein such as the gene III protein or the gene VIII protein. Monovalent phagemid display systems where the nucleic acid sequence encoding the protein or polypeptide is fused to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a portion of the gene III protein have been developed. Bass S. 8 309 1990 Lowman and Wells 3 205 1991 . In a monovalent phagemid display system the gene fusion is expressed at low levels and wild type gene III proteins are also expressed so that infectivity of the particles is retained. Methods of generating peptide libraries and screening those libraries have been disclosed in many patents e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 723 286 U.S. Pat. No. 5 432 018 U.S. Pat. No. 5 580 717 U.S. Pat. No. 5 427 908 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 498 530 .

Libraries of antibodies or antigen binding polypeptides have been prepared in a number of ways including by altering a single gene by inserting random DNA sequences or by cloning a family of related genes. Methods for displaying antibodies or antigen binding fragments using phage mid display have been described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 750 373 5 733 743 5 837 242 5 969 108 6 172 197 5 580 717 and 5 658 727. The library is then screened for expression of antibodies or antigen binding proteins with the desired characteristics.

Methods of substituting an amino acid of choice into a template nucleic acid are well established in the art some of which are described herein. For example hypervariable region residues can be substituted using the Kunkel method. See e.g. Kunkel et al. 154 367 382 1987 .

The sequence of oligonucleotides includes one or more of the designed codon sets for the hypervariable region residues to be altered. A codon set is a set of different nucleotide triplet sequences used to encode desired variant amino acids. Codon sets can be represented using symbols to designate particular nucleotides or equimolar mixtures of nucleotides as shown in below according to the IUB code.

For example in the codon set DVK D can be nucleotides A or G or T V can be A or G or C and K can be G or T. This codon set can present 18 different codons and can encode amino acids Ala Trp Tyr Lys Thr Asn Lys Ser Arg Asp Glu Gly and Cys.

Oligonucleotide or primer sets can be synthesized using standard methods. A set of oligonucleotides can be synthesized for example by solid phase synthesis containing sequences that represent all possible combinations of nucleotide triplets provided by the codon set and that will encode the desired group of amino acids. Synthesis of oligonucleotides with selected nucleotide degeneracy at certain positions is well known in that art. Such sets of nucleotides having certain codon sets can be synthesized using commercial nucleic acid synthesizers available from for example Applied Biosystems Foster City Calif. or can be obtained commercially for example from Life Technologies Rockville Md. . Therefore a set of oligonucleotides synthesized having a particular codon set will typically include a plurality of oligonucleotides with different sequences the differences established by the codon set within the overall sequence. Oligonucleotides as used according to the invention have sequences that allow for hybridization to a variable domain nucleic acid template and also can include restriction enzyme sites for cloning purposes.

In one method nucleic acid sequences encoding variant amino acids can be created by oligonucleotide mediated mutagenesis. This technique is well known in the art as described by Zoller et al. 10 6487 6504 1987 . Briefly nucleic acid sequences encoding variant amino acids are created by hybridizing an oligonucleotide set encoding the desired codon sets to a DNA template where the template is the single stranded form of the plasmid containing a variable region nucleic acid template sequence. After hybridization DNA polymerase is used to synthesize an entire second complementary strand of the template that will thus incorporate the oligonucleotide primer and will contain the codon sets as provided by the oligonucleotide set.

Generally oligonucleotides of at least 25 nucleotides in length are used. An optimal oligonucleotide will have 12 to 15 nucleotides that are completely complementary to the template on either side of the nucleotide s coding for the mutation s . This ensures that the oligonucleotide will hybridize properly to the single stranded DNA template molecule. The oligonucleotides are readily synthesized using techniques known in the art such as that described by Crea et al. 75 5765 1978 .

The DNA template is generated by those vectors that are either derived from bacteriophage M13 vectors the commercially available M13mp18 and M13mp19 vectors are suitable or those vectors that contain a single stranded phage origin of replication as described by Viera et al. 153 3 1987 . Thus the DNA that is to be mutated can be inserted into one of these vectors in order to generate single stranded template. Production of the single stranded template is described in sections 4.21 4.41 of Sambrook et al. above.

To alter the native DNA sequence the oligonucleotide is hybridized to the single stranded template under suitable hybridization conditions. A DNA polymerizing enzyme usually T7 DNA polymerase or the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I is then added to synthesize the complementary strand of the template using the oligonucleotide as a primer for synthesis. A heteroduplex molecule is thus formed such that one strand of DNA encodes the mutated form of gene 1 and the other strand the original template encodes the native unaltered sequence of gene 1. This heteroduplex molecule is then transformed into a suitable host cell usually a prokaryote such as JM101. After growing the cells they are plated onto agarose plates and screened using the oligonucleotide primer radiolabelled with a 32 Phosphate to identify the bacterial colonies that contain the mutated DNA.

The method described immediately above may be modified such that a homoduplex molecule is created wherein both strands of the plasmid contain the mutation s . The modifications are as follows The single stranded oligonucleotide is annealed to the single stranded template as described above. A mixture of three deoxyribonucleotides deoxyriboadenosine dATP deoxyriboguanosine dGTP and deoxyribothymidine dTT is combined with a modified thiodeoxyribocytosine called dCTP aS which can be obtained from Amersham . This mixture is added to the template oligonucleotide complex. Upon addition of DNA polymerase to this mixture a strand of DNA identical to the template except for the mutated bases is generated. In addition this new strand of DNA will contain dCTP aS instead of dCTP which serves to protect it from restriction endonuclease digestion. After the template strand of the double stranded heteroduplex is nicked with an appropriate restriction enzyme the template strand can be digested with ExoIII nuclease or another appropriate nuclease past the region that contains the site s to be mutagenized. The reaction is then stopped to leave a molecule that is only partially single stranded. A complete double stranded DNA homoduplex is then formed using DNA polymerase in the presence of all four deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates ATP and DNA ligase. This homoduplex molecule can then be transformed into a suitable host cell.

As indicated previously the sequence of the oligonucleotide set is of sufficient length to hybridize to the template nucleic acid and may also but does not necessarily contain restriction sites. The DNA template can be generated by those vectors that are either derived from bacteriophage M13 vectors or vectors that contain a single stranded phage origin of replication as described by Viera et al. 153 3 1987 . Thus the DNA that is to be mutated must be inserted into one of these vectors in order to generate single stranded template. Production of the single stranded template is described in sections 4.21 4.41 of Sambrook et al. supra.

According to another method a library can be generated by providing upstream and downstream oligonucleotide sets each set having a plurality of oligonucleotides with different sequences the different sequences established by the codon sets provided within the sequence of the oligonucleotides. The upstream and downstream oligonucleotide sets along with a variable domain template nucleic acid sequence can be used in a polymerase chain reaction to generate a library of PCR products. The PCR products can be referred to as nucleic acid cassettes as they can be fused with other related or unrelated nucleic acid sequences for example viral coat proteins and dimerization domains using established molecular biology techniques.

The sequence of the PCR primers includes one or more of the designed codon sets for the solvent accessible and highly diverse positions in a hypervariable region. As described above a codon set is a set of different nucleotide triplet sequences used to encode desired variant amino acids.

Antibody selectants that meet the desired criteria as selected through appropriate screening selection steps can be isolated and cloned using standard recombinant techniques.

The present invention encompasses antibody fragments. Antibody fragments may be generated by traditional means such as enzymatic digestion or by recombinant techniques. In certain circumstances there are advantages of using antibody fragments rather than whole antibodies. The smaller size of the fragments allows for rapid clearance and may lead to improved access to solid tumors. For a review of certain antibody fragments see Hudson et al. 2003 9 129 134.

Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies see e.g. Morimoto et al. 24 107 117 1992 and Brennan et al. 229 81 1985 . However these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. Fab Fv and ScFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from thus allowing the facile production of large amounts of these fragments. Antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively Fab SH fragments can be directly recovered from and chemically coupled to form F ab fragments Carter et al. 10 163 167 1992 . According to another approach F ab fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Fab and F ab fragment with increased in vivo half life comprising salvage receptor binding epitope residues are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 869 046. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In certain embodiments an antibody is a single chain Fv fragment scFv . See WO 93 16185 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 571 894 and 5 587 458. Fv and scFv are the only species with intact combining sites that are devoid of constant regions thus they may be suitable for reduced nonspecific binding during in vivo use. scFv fusion proteins may be constructed to yield fusion of an effector protein at either the amino or the carboxy terminus of an scFv. See ed. Borrebaeck supra. The antibody fragment may also be a linear antibody e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 870 for example. Such linear antibodies may be monospecific or bispecific.

The invention encompasses humanized antibodies. Various methods for humanizing non human antibodies are known in the art. For example a humanized antibody can have one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non human. These non human amino acid residues are often referred to as import residues which are typically taken from an import variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co workers Jones et al. 1986 321 522 525 Riechmann et al. 1988 332 323 327 Verhoeyen et al. 1988 239 1534 1536 by substituting hypervariable region sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly such humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non human species. In practice humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some hypervariable region residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.

The choice of human variable domains both light and heavy to be used in making the humanized antibodies can be important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so called best fit method the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework for the humanized antibody. See e.g. Sims et al. 1993 151 2296 Chothia et al. 1987 196 901. Another method uses a particular framework derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies. See e.g. Carter et al. 1992 89 4285 Presta et al. 1993 151 2623.

It is further generally desirable that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal according to one method humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence i.e. the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic such as increased affinity for the target antigen s is achieved. In general the hypervariable region residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.

Human antibodies of the invention can be constructed by combining Fv clone variable domain sequence s selected from human derived phage display libraries with known human constant domain sequences s as described above. Alternatively human monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be made by the hybridoma method. Human myeloma and mouse human heteromyeloma cell lines for the production of human monoclonal antibodies have been described for example by Kozbor 133 3001 1984 Brodeur et al. pp. 51 63 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1987 and Boerner et al. 147 86 1991 .

It is now possible to produce transgenic animals e.g. mice that are capable upon immunization of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy chain joining region JH gene in chimeric and germ line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See e.g. Jakobovits et al. 90 2551 1993 Jakobovits et al. 362 255 1993 Bruggermann et al. 7 33 1993 .

Gene shuffling can also be used to derive human antibodies from non human e.g. rodent antibodies where the human antibody has similar affinities and specificities to the starting non human antibody. According to this method which is also called epitope imprinting either the heavy or light chain variable region of a non human antibody fragment obtained by phage display techniques as described herein is replaced with a repertoire of human V domain genes creating a population of non human chain human chain scFv or Fab chimeras. Selection with antigen results in isolation of a non human chain human chain chimeric scFv or Fab wherein the human chain restores the antigen binding site destroyed upon removal of the corresponding non human chain in the primary phage display clone i.e. the epitope governs imprints the choice of the human chain partner. When the process is repeated in order to replace the remaining non human chain a human antibody is obtained see PCT WO 93 06213 published Apr. 1 1993 . Unlike traditional humanization of non human antibodies by HVR grafting this technique provides completely human antibodies which have no FR or HVR residues of non human origin.

Bispecific antibodies are monoclonal antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different antigens. In certain embodiments bispecific antibodies are human or humanized antibodies. In certain embodiments one of the binding specificities is for FGF19 and the other is for any other antigen. In certain embodiments bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of FGF19. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express FGF19. These antibodies possess a FGF19 binding arm and an arm which binds a cytotoxic agent such as e.g. saporin anti interferon vinca alkaloid ricin A chain methotrexate or radioactive isotope hapten. Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments e.g. F ab bispecific antibodies .

Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies is based on the co expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pairs where the two heavy chains have different specificities Milstein and Cuello 305 537 1983 . Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains these hybridomas quadromas produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. The purification of the correct molecule which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps is rather cumbersome and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93 08829 published May 13 1993 and in Traunecker et al. 10 3655 1991 .

According to a different approach antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities antibody antigen combining sites are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion for example is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain comprising at least part of the hinge CH2 and CH3 regions. In certain embodiments the first heavy chain constant region CH1 containing the site necessary for light chain binding is present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and if desired the immunoglobulin light chain are inserted into separate expression vectors and are co transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is however possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.

In one embodiment of this approach the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pair providing a second binding specificity in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in WO 94 04690. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see for example Suresh et al. 121 210 1986 .

According to another approach the interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The interface comprises at least a part of the C3 domain of an antibody constant domain. In this method one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan . Compensatory cavities of identical or similar size to the large side chain s are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones e.g. alanine or threonine . This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end products such as homodimers.

Bispecific antibodies include cross linked or heteroconjugate antibodies. For example one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin the other to biotin. Such antibodies have for example been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 and for treatment of HIV infection WO 91 00360 WO 92 00373 and EP 03089 . Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross linking method. Suitable cross linking agents are well known in the art and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 along with a number of cross linking techniques.

Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described in the literature. For example bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al. 229 81 1985 describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F ab fragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate TNB derivatives. One of the Fab TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.

Recent progress has facilitated the direct recovery of Fab SH fragments from which can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al. 175 217 225 1992 describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F ab molecule. Each Fab fragment was separately secreted from and subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the HER2 receptor and normal human T cells as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets.

Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al. 148 5 1547 1553 1992 . The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re dized to form the antibody heterodimers.

This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The diabody technology described by Hollinger et al. 90 6444 6448 1993 has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain VH connected to a light chain variable domain VL by a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly the VH and VL domains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary VL and VH domains of another fragment thereby forming two antigen binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single chain Fv sFv dimers has also been reported. See Gruber et al. 152 5368 1994 .

Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example trispecific antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al. 147 60 1991 .

A multivalent antibody may be internalized and or catabolized faster than a bivalent antibody by a cell expressing an antigen to which the antibodies bind. The antibodies of the present invention can be multivalent antibodies which are other than of the IgM class with three or more antigen binding sites e.g. tetravalent antibodies which can be readily produced by recombinant expression of nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide chains of the antibody. The multivalent antibody can comprise a dimerization domain and three or more antigen binding sites. In certain embodiments the dimerization domain comprises or consists of an Fc region or a hinge region. In this scenario the antibody will comprise an Fc region and three or more antigen binding sites amino terminal to the Fc region. In certain embodiments a multivalent antibody comprises or consists of three to about eight antigen binding sites. In one such embodiment a multivalent antibody comprises or consists of four antigen binding sites. The multivalent antibody comprises at least one polypeptide chain for example two polypeptide chains wherein the polypeptide chain s comprise two or more variable domains. For instance the polypeptide chain s may comprise VD1 X1 n VD2 X2 n Fc wherein VD1 is a first variable domain VD2 is a second variable domain Fc is one polypeptide chain of an Fc region X1 and X2 represent an amino acid or polypeptide and n is 0 or 1. For instance the polypeptide chain s may comprise VH CH1 flexible linker VH CH1 Fc region chain or VH CH1 VH CH1 Fc region chain. The multivalent antibody herein may further comprise at least two for example four light chain variable domain polypeptides. The multivalent antibody herein may for instance comprise from about two to about eight light chain variable domain polypeptides. The light chain variable domain polypeptides contemplated here comprise a light chain variable domain and optionally further comprise a CL domain.

In some embodiments an antibody of the invention is a single domain antibody. A single domain antibody is a single polypeptide chain comprising all or a portion of the heavy chain variable domain or all or a portion of the light chain variable domain of an antibody. In certain embodiments a single domain antibody is a human single domain antibody Domantis Inc. Waltham Mass. see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 248 516 B1 . In one embodiment a single domain antibody consists of all or a portion of the heavy chain variable domain of an antibody.

In some embodiments amino acid sequence modification s of the antibodies described herein are contemplated. For example it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of the antibody may be prepared by introducing appropriate changes into the nucleotide sequence encoding the antibody or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include for example deletions from and or insertions into and or substitutions of residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of deletion insertion and substitution can be made to arrive at the final construct provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid alterations may be introduced in the subject antibody amino acid sequence at the time that sequence is made.

A useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called alanine scanning mutagenesis as described by Cunningham and Wells 1989 244 1081 1085. Here a residue or group of target residues are identified e.g. charged residues such as arg asp his lys and glu and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid e.g. alanine or polyalanine to affect the interaction of the amino acids with antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at or for the sites of substitution. Thus while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed immunoglobulins are screened for the desired activity.

Amino acid sequence insertions include amino and or carboxyl terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N terminal methionyl residue. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N or C terminus of the antibody to an enzyme e.g. for ADEPT or a polypeptide which increases the serum half life of the antibody.

In certain embodiments an antibody of the invention is altered to increase or decrease the extent to which the antibody is glycosylated. Glycosylation of polypeptides is typically either N linked or O linked. N linked refers to the attachment of a carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine X serine and asparagine X threonine where X is any amino acid except proline are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N aceylgalactosamine galactose or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid most commonly serine or threonine although 5 hydroxyproline or 5 hydroxylysine may also be used.

Addition or deletion of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that one or more of the above described tripeptide sequences for N linked glycosylation sites is created or removed. The alteration may also be made by the addition deletion or substitution of one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody for O linked glycosylation sites .

Where the antibody comprises an Fc region the carbohydrate attached thereto may be altered. Native antibodies produced by mammalian cells typically comprise a branched biantennary oligosaccharide that is generally attached by an N linkage to Asn297 of the CH2 domain of the Fc region. See e.g. Wright et al. 1997 15 26 32. The oligosaccharide may include various carbohydrates e.g. mannose N acetyl glucosamine GlcNAc galactose and sialic acid as well as a fucose attached to a GlcNAc in the stem of the biantennary oligosaccharide structure. In some embodiments modifications of the oligosaccharide in an antibody of the invention may be made in order to create antibody variants with certain improved properties.

For example antibody variants are provided having a carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose attached directly or indirectly to an Fc region. Such variants may have improved ADCC function. See e.g. US Patent Publication Nos. US 2003 0157108 Presta L. US 2004 0093621 Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co. Ltd . Examples of publications related to defucosylated or fucose deficient antibody variants include US 2003 0157108 WO 2000 61739 WO 2001 29246 US 2003 0115614 US 2002 0164328 US 2004 0093621 US 2004 0132140 US 2004 0110704 US 2004 0110282 US 2004 0109865 WO 2003 085119 WO 2003 084570 WO 2005 035586 WO 2005 035778 WO2005 053742 WO2002 031140 Okazaki et al. 336 1239 1249 2004 Yamane Ohnuki et al. 87 614 2004 . Examples of cell lines capable of producing defucosylated antibodies include Lec13 CHO cells deficient in protein fucosylation Ripka et al. 249 533 545 1986 US Pat Appl No US 2003 0157108 A1 Presta L and WO 2004 056312 A1 Adams et al. especially at Example 11 and knockout cell lines such as alpha 1 6 fucosyltransferase gene FUT8 knockout CHO cells see e.g. Yamane Ohnuki et al. 87 614 2004 Kanda Y. et al. 94 4 680 688 2006 and WO2003 085107 .

Antibodies variants are further provided with bisected oligosaccharides e.g. in which a biantennary oligosaccharide attached to the Fc region of the antibody is bisected by GlcNAc. Such antibody variants may have reduced fucosylation and or improved ADCC function.

Examples of such antibody variants are described e.g. in WO 2003 011878 Jean Mairet et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 602 684 Umana et al. and US 2005 0123546 Umana et al. . Antibody variants with at least one galactose residue in the oligosaccharide attached to the Fc region are also provided. Such antibody variants may have improved CDC function. Such antibody variants are described e.g. in WO 1997 30087 Patel et al. WO 1998 58964 Raju S. and WO 1999 22764 Raju S. .

In certain embodiments an antibody variant comprises an Fc region with one or more amino acid substitutions which further improve ADCC for example substitutions at positions 298 333 and or 334 of the Fc region Eu numbering of residues . Such substitutions may occur in combination with any of the variations described above.

In certain embodiments the invention contemplates an antibody variant that possesses some but not all effector functions which make it a desirable candidate for many applications in which the half life of the antibody in vivo is important yet certain effector functions such as complement and ADCC are unnecessary or deleterious. In certain embodiments the Fc activities of the antibody are measured to ensure that only the desired properties are maintained. In vitro and or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the reduction depletion of CDC and or ADCC activities. For example Fc receptor FcR binding assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks Fc R binding hence likely lacking ADCC activity but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC NK cells express Fc RIII only whereas monocytes express Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 92 1991 . Non limiting examples of in vitro assays to assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 500 362 see e.g. Hellstrom I. et al. 83 7059 7063 1986 and Hellstrom I et al. 82 1499 1502 1985 U.S. Pat. No. 5 821 337 see Bruggemann M. et al. 166 1351 1361 1987 . Alternatively non radioactive assays methods may be employed see for example ACTI non radioactive cytotoxicity assay for flow cytometry CellTechnology Inc. Mountain View Calif. and CytoTox 96 non radioactive cytotoxicity assay Promega Madison Wis. . Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC and Natural Killer NK cells. Alternatively or additionally ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo e.g. in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. 95 652 656 1998 . C1q binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind C1q and hence lacks CDC activity. To assess complement activation a CDC assay may be performed see for example Gazzano Santoro et al. 202 163 1996 Cragg M. S. et al. 101 1045 1052 2003 and Cragg M. S. and M. J. Glennie 103 2738 2743 2004 . FcRn binding and in vivo clearance half life determinations can also be performed using methods known in the art see for example Petkova S. B. et al. 18 12 1759 1769 2006 .

Other antibody variants having one or more amino acid substitutions are provided. Sites of interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions but FR alterations are also contemplated. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 1 under the heading of preferred substitutions. More substantial changes denominated exemplary substitutions are provided in Table 1 or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes. Amino acid substitutions may be introduced into an antibody of interest and the products screened e.g. for a desired activity such as improved antigen binding decreased immunogenicity improved ADCC or CDC etc.

Modifications in the biological properties of an antibody may be accomplished by selecting substitutions that affect a the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution for example as a sheet or helical conformation b the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site or c the bulk of the side chain. Amino acids may be grouped according to similarities in the properties of their side chains in A. L. Lehninger in Biochemistry second ed. pp. 73 75 Worth Publishers New York 1975 

Alternatively naturally occurring residues may be divided into groups based on common side chain properties 

Non conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class. Such substituted residues also may be introduced into the conservative substitution sites or into the remaining non conserved sites.

One type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody e.g. a humanized or human antibody . Generally the resulting variant s selected for further development will have modified e.g. improved biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. An exemplary substitutional variant is an affinity matured antibody which may be conveniently generated using phage display based affinity maturation techniques. Briefly several hypervariable region sites e.g. 6 7 sites are mutated to generate all possible amino acid substitutions at each site. The antibodies thus generated are displayed from filamentous phage particles as fusions to at least part of a phage coat protein e.g. the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity e.g. binding affinity . In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification scanning mutagenesis e.g. alanine scanning can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively or additionally it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and antigen. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to techniques known in the art including those elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated the panel of variants is subjected to screening using techniques known in the art including those described herein and variants with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.

Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include but are not limited to isolation from a natural source in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants or preparation by oligonucleotide mediated or site directed mutagenesis PCR mutagenesis and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non variant version of the antibody.

It may be desirable to introduce one or more amino acid modifications in an Fc region of antibodies of the invention thereby generating an Fc region variant. The Fc region variant may comprise a human Fc region sequence e.g. a human IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 or IgG4 Fc region comprising an amino acid modification e.g. a substitution at one or more amino acid positions including that of a hinge cysteine.

In accordance with this description and the teachings of the art it is contemplated that in some embodiments an antibody of the invention may comprise one or more alterations as compared to the wild type counterpart antibody e.g. in the Fc region. These antibodies would nonetheless retain substantially the same characteristics required for therapeutic utility as compared to their wild type counterpart. For example it is thought that certain alterations can be made in the Fc region that would result in altered i.e. either improved or diminished C1q binding and or Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity CDC e.g. as described in WO99 51642. See also Duncan Winter 322 738 40 1988 U.S. Pat. No. 5 648 260 U.S. Pat. No. 5 624 821 and WO94 29351 concerning other examples of Fc region variants. WO00 42072 Presta and WO 2004 056312 Lowman describe antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs. The content of these patent publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference. See also Shields et al. 9 2 6591 6604 2001 . Antibodies with increased half lives and improved binding to the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus Guyer et al. 117 587 1976 and Kim et al. 24 249 1994 are described in US2005 0014934A1 Hinton et al. . These antibodies comprise an Fc region with one or more substitutions therein which improve binding of the Fc region to FcRn. Polypeptide variants with altered Fc region amino acid sequences and increased or decreased C1q binding capability are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 194 551B1 WO99 51642. The contents of those patent publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference. See also Idusogie et al. 164 4178 4184 2000 .

In another aspect the invention provides antibodies comprising modifications in the interface of Fc polypeptides comprising the Fc region wherein the modifications facilitate and or promote heterodimerization. These modifications comprise introduction of a protuberance into a first Fc polypeptide and a cavity into a second Fc polypeptide wherein the protuberance is positionable in the cavity so as to promote complexing of the first and second Fc polypeptides. Methods of generating antibodies with these modifications are known in the art e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 731 168.

In yet another aspect it may be desirable to create cysteine engineered antibodies e.g. thioMAbs in which one or more residues of an antibody are substituted with cysteine residues. In particular embodiments the substituted residues occur at accessible sites of the antibody. By substituting those residues with cysteine reactive thiol groups are thereby positioned at accessible sites of the antibody and may be used to conjugate the antibody to other moieties such as drug moieties or linker drug moieties as described further herein. In certain embodiments any one or more of the following residues may be substituted with cysteine V205 Kabat numbering of the light chain A118 EU numbering of the heavy chain and S400 EU numbering of the heavy chain Fc region.

The antibodies of the present invention can be further modified to contain additional nonproteinaceous moieties that are known in the art and readily available. Preferably the moieties suitable for derivatization of the antibody are water soluble polymers. Non limiting examples of water soluble polymers include but are not limited to polyethylene glycol PEG copolymers of ethylene glycol propylene glycol carboxymethylcellulose dextran polyvinyl alcohol polyvinyl pyrrolidone poly 1 3 dioxolane poly 1 3 6 trioxane ethylene maleic anhydride copolymer polyaminoacids either homopolymers or random copolymers and dextran or poly n vinyl pyrrolidone polyethylene glycol propropylene glycol homopolymers polypropylene oxide ethylene oxide co polymers polyoxyethylated polyols e.g. glycerol polyvinyl alcohol and mixtures thereof. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde may have advantages in manufacturing due to its stability in water. The polymer may be of any molecular weight and may be branched or unbranched. The number of polymers attached to the antibody may vary and if more than one polymer are attached they can be the same or different molecules. In general the number and or type of polymers used for derivatization can be determined based on considerations including but not limited to the particular properties or functions of the antibody to be improved whether the antibody derivative will be used in a therapy under defined conditions etc.

In another embodiment conjugates of an antibody and nonproteinaceous moiety that may be selectively heated by exposure to radiation are provided. In one embodiment the nonproteinaceous moiety is a carbon nanotube Kam et al. 102 11600 11605 2005 . The radiation may be of any wavelength and includes but is not limited to wavelengths that do not harm ordinary cells but which heat the nonproteinaceous moiety to a temperature at which cells proximal to the antibody nonproteinaceous moiety are killed.

The antibodies of the present invention can be characterized for their physical chemical properties and biological functions by various assays known in the art.

In one aspect assays are provided for identifying anti 19 antibodies thereof having biological activity. Biological activity may include e.g. the modulation of one or more aspects of FGF19 associated effects including but not limited to FGF19 binding FGFR4 activation FGFR4 downstream molecular signaling disruption of FGFR4 binding to FGF19 FGFR4 multimerization expression of a CYP7 1 gene phosphorylation of FGFR4 MAPK FRS2 and or ERK2 activation of catenin FGF19 promoted cell migration and or disruption of any biologically relevant FGF19 and or FGFR4 biological pathway and or treatment and or prevention of a tumor cell proliferative disorder or a cancer and or treatment or prevention of a disorder associated with FGF19 expression and or activity such as increased FGF19 expression and or activity .

In certain embodiments an antibody of the invention is tested for its ability to inhibit reduce and or block FGF19 induced repression of expression of a CYP7 1 gene in a cell exposed to FGF19 using methods known in the art e.g. as described in co owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 673 411 filed Feb. 9 2007. In certain embodiments an antibody of the invention is tested for its ability to inhibit reduce and or block FGF19 induced phosphorylation of FGFR4 MAPK FRS2 and or ERK2 in a cell exposed to FGF19 using methods known in the art e.g. as described in co owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 673 411 filed Feb. 9 2007 or exemplified herein. In certain embodiments an antibody of the invention is tested for its ability to inhibit reduce and or block FGF19 promoted cell e.g. a tumor cell e.g. an HCT116 cell migration using methods known in the art e.g. as described in co owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 673 411 filed Feb. 9 2007 . In certain embodiments an antibody of the invention is tested for its ability to inhibit reduce and or block Wnt pathway activation in a cell. In some embodiments Wnt pathway activation comprises one or more of catenin immunoreactivity tyrosine phosphorylation of catenin expression of Wnt target genes catenin mutation and E cadherin binding to catenin. Detection of Wnt pathway activation is known in the art and some examples are described and exemplified in e.g. co owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 673 411 filed Feb. 9 2007.

In one aspect an antibody of the invention is tested for its antigen binding activity e.g. by known methods such as ELISA Western blot etc. In some embodiments an antibody of the invention is tested for its ability to block FGF19 binding to FGFR4 for example as exemplified herein. In another aspect competition assays may be used to identify a monoclonal antibody that competes with any of the anti FGF19 antibodies described herein for binding to FGF19. In certain embodiments such a competing antibody binds to the same epitope e.g. a linear or a conformational epitope that is bound by any of the anti FGF19 antibodies described herein. Exemplary competition assays include but are not limited to routine assays such as those provided in Harlow and Lane 1988 ch. 14 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. . Detailed exemplary methods for mapping an epitope to which an antibody binds are provided in Morris 1996 Epitope Mapping Protocols in vol. 66 Humana Press Totowa N.J. . Two antibodies are said to bind to the same epitope if each blocks binding of the other by 50 or more.

In an exemplary competition assay immobilized FGF19 is incubated in a solution comprising a first labeled antibody that binds to FGF19 and a second unlabeled antibody that is being tested for its ability to compete with the first antibody for binding to FGF19. The second antibody may be present in a hybridoma supernatant. As a control immobilized FGF19 is incubated in a solution comprising the first labeled antibody but not the second unlabeled antibody. After incubation under conditions permissive for binding of the first antibody to FGF19 excess unbound antibody is removed and the amount of label associated with immobilized FGF19 is measured. If the amount of label associated with immobilized FGF19 is substantially reduced in the test sample relative to the control sample then that indicates that the second antibody is competing with the first antibody for binding to FGF19.

The purified immunoglobulins can be further characterized by a series of assays including but not limited to N terminal sequencing amino acid analysis non denaturing size exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC mass spectrometry ion exchange chromatography and papain digestion.

In certain embodiments of the invention the immunoglobulins produced herein are analyzed for their biological activity.

An illustrative antigen binding assay is provided below in the Examples section.

In some embodiments the present invention contemplates altered antibodies that possess some but not all effector functions which make it a desired candidate for many applications in which the half life of the antibody in vivo is important yet certain effector functions such as complement and ADCC are unnecessary or deleterious. In certain embodiments the Fc activities of the produced immunoglobulin are measured to ensure that only the desired properties are maintained. In vitro and or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the reduction depletion of CDC and or ADCC activities. For example Fc receptor FcR binding assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks Fc R binding hence likely lacking ADCC activity but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC NK cells express Fc RIII only whereas monocytes express Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet Annu Rev. Immunol 9 457 92 1991 . An example of an in vitro assay to assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 500 362 or 5 821 337. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC and Natural Killer NK cells. Alternatively or additionally ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo e.g. in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. PNAS USA 95 652 656 1998 . C1q binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind C1q and hence lacks CDC activity. To assess complement activation a CDC assay e.g. as described in Gazzano Santoro et al. J. Immunol. Methods 202 163 1996 may be performed. FcRn binding and in vivo clearance half life determinations can also be performed using methods known in the art.

In some embodiments the invention provides altered antibodies that possess increased effector functions and or increased half life.

For recombinant production of an antibody of the invention the nucleic acid encoding it is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning amplification of the DNA or for expression. DNA encoding the antibody is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody . Many vectors are available. The choice of vector depends in part on the host cell to be used. Generally preferred host cells are of either prokaryotic or eukaryotic generally mammalian origin. It will be appreciated that constant regions of any isotype can be used for this purpose including IgG IgM IgA IgD and IgE constant regions and that such constant regions can be obtained from any human or animal species.

Polynucleotide sequences encoding polypeptide components of the antibody of the invention can be obtained using standard recombinant techniques. Desired polynucleotide sequences may be isolated and sequenced from antibody producing cells such as hybridoma cells. Alternatively polynucleotides can be synthesized using nucleotide synthesizer or PCR techniques. Once obtained sequences encoding the polypeptides are inserted into a recombinant vector capable of replicating and expressing heterologous polynucleotides in prokaryotic hosts. Many vectors that are available and known in the art can be used for the purpose of the present invention. Selection of an appropriate vector will depend mainly on the size of the nucleic acids to be inserted into the vector and the particular host cell to be transformed with the vector. Each vector contains various components depending on its function amplification or expression of heterologous polynucleotide or both and its compatibility with the particular host cell in which it resides. The vector components generally include but are not limited to an origin of replication a selection marker gene a promoter a ribosome binding site RBS a signal sequence the heterologous nucleic acid insert and a transcription termination sequence.

In general plasmid vectors containing replicon and control sequences which are derived from species compatible with the host cell are used in connection with these hosts. The vector ordinarily carries a replication site as well as marking sequences which are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells. For example E. coli is typically transformed using pBR322 a plasmid derived from an species. pBR322 contains genes encoding ampicillin Amp and tetracycline Tet resistance and thus provides easy means for identifying transformed cells. pBR322 its derivatives or other microbial plasmids or bacteriophage may also contain or be modified to contain promoters which can be used by the microbial organism for expression of endogenous proteins. Examples of pBR322 derivatives used for expression of particular antibodies are described in detail in Carter et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 648 237.

In addition phage vectors containing replicon and control sequences that are compatible with the host microorganism can be used as transforming vectors in connection with these hosts. For example bacteriophage such as GEM.TM. 11 may be utilized in making a recombinant vector which can be used to transform susceptible host cells such as LE392.

The expression vector of the invention may comprise two or more promoter cistron pairs encoding each of the polypeptide components. A promoter is an untranslated regulatory sequence located upstream 5 to a cistron that modulates its expression. Prokaryotic promoters typically fall into two classes inducible and constitutive. Inducible promoter is a promoter that initiates increased levels of transcription of the cistron under its control in response to changes in the culture condition e.g. the presence or absence of a nutrient or a change in temperature.

A large number of promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known. The selected promoter can be operably linked to cistron DNA encoding the light or heavy chain by removing the promoter from the source DNA via restriction enzyme digestion and inserting the isolated promoter sequence into the vector of the invention. Both the native promoter sequence and many heterologous promoters may be used to direct amplification and or expression of the target genes. In some embodiments heterologous promoters are utilized as they generally permit greater transcription and higher yields of expressed target gene as compared to the native target polypeptide promoter.

Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the PhoA promoter the galactamase and lactose promoter systems a tryptophan trp promoter system and hybrid promoters such as the tac or the trc promoter. However other promoters that are functional in bacteria such as other known bacterial or phage promoters are suitable as well. Their nucleotide sequences have been published thereby enabling a skilled worker operably to ligate them to cistrons encoding the target light and heavy chains Siebenlist et al. 1980 Cell 20 269 using linkers or adaptors to supply any required restriction sites.

In one aspect of the invention each cistron within the recombinant vector comprises a secretion signal sequence component that directs translocation of the expressed polypeptides across a membrane. In general the signal sequence may be a component of the vector or it may be a part of the target polypeptide DNA that is inserted into the vector. The signal sequence selected for the purpose of this invention should be one that is recognized and processed i.e. cleaved by a signal peptidase by the host cell. For prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process the signal sequences native to the heterologous polypeptides the signal sequence is substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence selected for example from the group consisting of the alkaline phosphatase penicillinase Ipp or heat stable enterotoxin II STII leaders LamB PhoE PelB OmpA and MBP. In one embodiment of the invention the signal sequences used in both cistrons of the expression system are STII signal sequences or variants thereof.

In another aspect the production of the immunoglobulins according to the invention can occur in the cytoplasm of the host cell and therefore does not require the presence of secretion signal sequences within each cistron. In that regard immunoglobulin light and heavy chains are expressed folded and assembled to form functional immunoglobulins within the cytoplasm. Certain host strains e.g. the trxB strains provide cytoplasm conditions that are favorable for disulfide bond formation thereby permitting proper folding and assembly of expressed protein subunits. Proba and Pluckthun Gene 159 203 1995 .

Prokaryotic host cells suitable for expressing antibodies of the invention include Archaebacteria and Eubacteria such as Gram negative or Gram positive organisms. Examples of useful bacteria include e.g. Bacilli e.g. Enterobacteria species e.g. or . In one embodiment gram negative cells are used. In one embodiment cells are used as hosts for the invention. Examples of strains include strain W3110 Bachmann Cellular and Molecular Biology vol. 2 Washington D.C. American Society for Microbiology 1987 pp. 1190 1219 ATCC Deposit No. 27 325 and derivatives thereof including strain 33D3 having genotype W3110 fhuA tonA ptr3 lac Iq lacL8 ompT nmpc fepE degP41 kanR U.S. Pat. No. 5 639 635 . Other strains and derivatives thereof such as 294 ATCC 31 446 B 1776 ATCC 31 537 and RV308 ATCC 31 608 are also suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting. Methods for constructing derivatives of any of the above mentioned bacteria having defined genotypes are known in the art and described in for example Bass et al. Proteins 8 309 314 1990 . It is generally necessary to select the appropriate bacteria taking into consideration replicability of the replicon in the cells of a bacterium. For example or species can be suitably used as the host when well known plasmids such as pBR322 pBR325 pACYC177 or pKN410 are used to supply the replicon. Typically the host cell should secrete minimal amounts of proteolytic enzymes and additional protease inhibitors may desirably be incorporated in the cell culture.

Host cells are transformed with the above described expression vectors and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters selecting transformants or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.

Transformation means introducing DNA into the prokaryotic host so that the DNA is replicable either as an extrachromosomal element or by chromosomal integrant. Depending on the host cell used transformation is done using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride is generally used for bacterial cells that contain substantial cell wall barriers. Another method for transformation employs polyethylene glycol DMSO. Yet another technique used is electroporation.

Prokaryotic cells used to produce the polypeptides of the invention are grown in media known in the art and suitable for culture of the selected host cells. Examples of suitable media include luria broth LB plus necessary nutrient supplements. In some embodiments the media also contains a selection agent chosen based on the construction of the expression vector to selectively permit growth of prokaryotic cells containing the expression vector. For example ampicillin is added to media for growth of cells expressing ampicillin resistant gene.

Any necessary supplements besides carbon nitrogen and inorganic phosphate sources may also be included at appropriate concentrations introduced alone or as a mixture with another supplement or medium such as a complex nitrogen source. Optionally the culture medium may contain one or more reducing agents selected from the group consisting of glutathione cysteine cystamine thioglycollate dithioerythritol and dithiothreitol.

The prokaryotic host cells are cultured at suitable temperatures. For growth for example the preferred temperature ranges from about 20 C. to about 39 C. more preferably from about 25 C. to about 37 C. even more preferably at about 30 C. The pH of the medium may be any pH ranging from about 5 to about 9 depending mainly on the host organism. For the pH is preferably from about 6.8 to about 7.4 and more preferably about 7.0.

If an inducible promoter is used in the expression vector of the invention protein expression is induced under conditions suitable for the activation of the promoter. In one aspect of the invention PhoA promoters are used for controlling transcription of the polypeptides. Accordingly the transformed host cells are cultured in a phosphate limiting medium for induction. Preferably the phosphate limiting medium is the C.R.A.P medium see e.g. Simmons et al. J. Immunol. Methods 2002 263 133 147 . A variety of other inducers may be used according to the vector construct employed as is known in the art.

In one embodiment the expressed polypeptides of the present invention are secreted into and recovered from the periplasm of the host cells. Protein recovery typically involves disrupting the microorganism generally by such means as osmotic shock sonication or lysis. Once cells are disrupted cell debris or whole cells may be removed by centrifugation or filtration. The proteins may be further purified for example by affinity resin chromatography. Alternatively proteins can be transported into the culture media and isolated therein. Cells may be removed from the culture and the culture supernatant being filtered and concentrated for further purification of the proteins produced. The expressed polypeptides can be further isolated and identified using commonly known methods such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis PAGE and Western blot assay.

In one aspect of the invention antibody production is conducted in large quantity by a fermentation process. Various large scale fed batch fermentation procedures are available for production of recombinant proteins. Large scale fermentations have at least 1000 liters of capacity preferably about 1 000 to 100 000 liters of capacity. These fermentors use agitator impellers to distribute oxygen and nutrients especially glucose the preferred carbon energy source . Small scale fermentation refers generally to fermentation in a fermentor that is no more than approximately 100 liters in volumetric capacity and can range from about 1 liter to about 100 liters.

In a fermentation process induction of protein expression is typically initiated after the cells have been grown under suitable conditions to a desired density e.g. an OD550 of about 180 220 at which stage the cells are in the early stationary phase. A variety of inducers may be used according to the vector construct employed as is known in the art and described above. Cells may be grown for shorter periods prior to induction. Cells are usually induced for about 12 50 hours although longer or shorter induction time may be used.

To improve the production yield and quality of the polypeptides of the invention various fermentation conditions can be modified. For example to improve the proper assembly and folding of the secreted antibody polypeptides additional vectors overexpressing chaperone proteins such as Dsb proteins DsbA DsbB DsbC DsbD and or DsbG or FkpA a peptidylprolyl cis trans isomerase with chaperone activity can be used to co transform the host prokaryotic cells. The chaperone proteins have been demonstrated to facilitate the proper folding and solubility of heterologous proteins produced in bacterial host cells. Chen et al. 1999 J Bio Chem 274 19601 19605 Georgiou et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 083 715 Georgiou et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 027 888 Bothmann and Pluckthun 2000 J. Biol. Chem. 275 17100 17105 Ramm and Pluckthun 2000 J. Biol. Chem. 275 17106 17113 Arie et al. 2001 Mol. Microbiol. 39 199 210.

To minimize proteolysis of expressed heterologous proteins especially those that are proteolytically sensitive certain host strains deficient for proteolytic enzymes can be used for the present invention. For example host cell strains may be modified to effect genetic mutation s in the genes encoding known bacterial proteases such as Protease III OmpT DegP Tsp Protease I Protease Mi Protease V Protease VI and combinations thereof. Some protease deficient strains are available and described in for example Joly et al. 1998 supra Georgiou et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 264 365 Georgiou et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 508 192 Hara et al. Microbial Drug Resistance 2 63 72 1996 .

In one embodiment strains deficient for proteolytic enzymes and transformed with plasmids overexpressing one or more chaperone proteins are used as host cells in the expression system of the invention.

Standard protein purification methods known in the art can be employed. The following procedures are exemplary of suitable purification procedures fractionation on immunoaffinity or ion exchange columns ethanol precipitation reverse phase HPLC chromatography on silica or on a cation exchange resin such as DEAE chromatofocusing SDS PAGE ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel filtration using for example Sephadex G 75.

In one aspect Protein A immobilized on a solid phase is used for immunoaffinity purification of the full length antibody products of the invention. Protein A is a 41 kD cell wall protein from which binds with a high affinity to the Fc region of antibodies. Lindmark et al 1983 J. Immunol. Meth. 62 1 13. The solid phase to which Protein A is immobilized is preferably a column comprising a glass or silica surface more preferably a controlled pore glass column or a silicic acid column. In some applications the column has been coated with a reagent such as glycerol in an attempt to prevent nonspecific adherence of contaminants.

As the first step of purification the preparation derived from the cell culture as described above is applied onto the Protein A immobilized solid phase to allow specific binding of the antibody of interest to Protein A. The solid phase is then washed to remove contaminants non specifically bound to the solid phase. Finally the antibody of interest is recovered from the solid phase by elution.

The vector components generally include but are not limited to one or more of the following a signal sequence an origin of replication one or more marker genes an enhancer element a promoter and a transcription termination sequence.

A vector for use in a eukaryotic host cell may also contain a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide of interest. The heterologous signal sequence selected preferably is one that is recognized and processed i.e. cleaved by a signal peptidase by the host cell. In mammalian cell expression mammalian signal sequences as well as viral secretory leaders for example the herpes simplex gD signal are available.

Generally an origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors. For example the SV40 origin may typically be used only because it contains the early promoter.

Expression and cloning vectors may contain a selection gene also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that a confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins e.g. ampicillin neomycin methotrexate or tetracycline b complement auxotrophic deficiencies where relevant or c supply critical nutrients not available from complex media.

One example of a selection scheme utilizes a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those cells that are successfully transformed with a heterologous gene produce a protein conferring drug resistance and thus survive the selection regimen. Examples of such dominant selection use the drugs neomycin mycophenolic acid and hygromycin.

Another example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification of cells competent to take up the antibody nucleic acid such as DHFR thymidine kinase metallothionein I and II preferably primate metallothionein genes adenosine deaminase ornithine decarboxylase etc.

For example cells transformed with the DHFR selection gene are first identified by culturing all of the transformants in a culture medium that contains methotrexate Mtx a competitive antagonist of DHFR. An appropriate host cell when wild type DHFR is employed is the Chinese hamster ovary CHO cell line deficient in DHFR activity e.g. ATCC CRL 9096 .

Alternatively host cells particularly wild type hosts that contain endogenous DHFR transformed or co transformed with DNA sequences encoding an antibody wild type DHFR protein and another selectable marker such as aminoglycoside 3 phosphotransferase APH can be selected by cell growth in medium containing a selection agent for the selectable marker such as an aminoglycosidic antibiotic e.g. kanamycin neomycin or G418. See U.S. Pat. No. 4 965 199.

Expression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and is operably linked to the antibody polypeptide nucleic acid. Promoter sequences are known for eukaryotes. Virtually alleukaryotic genes have an AT rich region located approximately 25 to 30 bases upstream from the site where transcription is initiated. Another sequence found 70 to 80 bases upstream from the start of transcription of many genes is a CNCAAT region where N may be any nucleotide. At the 3 end of most eukaryotic genes is an AATAAA sequence that may be the signal for addition of the poly A tail to the 3 end of the coding sequence. All of these sequences are suitably inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors.

Antibody polypeptide transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells is controlled for example by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus fowlpox virus adenovirus such as Adenovirus 2 bovine papilloma virus avian sarcoma virus cytomegalovirus a retrovirus hepatitis B virus and Simian Virus 40 SV40 from heterologous mammalian promoters e.g. the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter from heat shock promoters provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.

The early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40 restriction fragment that also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication. The immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a HindIII E restriction fragment. A system for expressing DNA in mammalian hosts using the bovine papilloma virus as a vector is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 419 446. A modification of this system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 601 978. Alternatively the Rous Sarcoma Virus long terminal repeat can be used as the promoter.

Transcription of DNA encoding the antibody polypeptide of this invention by higher eukaryotes is often increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes globin elastase albumin fetoprotein and insulin . Typically however one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin bp 100 270 the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin and adenovirus enhancers. See also Yaniv Nature 297 17 18 1982 on enhancing elements for activation of eukaryotic promoters. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5 or 3 to the antibody polypeptide encoding sequence but is preferably located at a site 5 from the promoter.

Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells will typically also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5 and occasionally 3 untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding an antibody. One useful transcription termination component is the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation region. See WO94 11026 and the expression vector disclosed therein.

Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein include higher eukaryote cells described herein including vertebrate host cells. Propagation of vertebrate cells in culture tissue culture has become a routine procedure. Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 COS 7 ATCC CRL 1651 human embryonic kidney line 293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture Graham et al.

Host cells are transformed with the above described expression or cloning vectors for antibody production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters selecting transformants or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.

The host cells used to produce an antibody of this invention may be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham s F10 Sigma Minimal Essential Medium MEM Sigma RPMI 1640 Sigma and Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Medium DMEM Sigma are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition any of the media described in Ham et al. Meth. Enz. 58 44 1979 Barnes et al. Anal. Biochem. 102 255 1980 U.S. Pat. No. 4 767 704 4 657 866 4 927 762 4 560 655 or 5 122 469 WO 90 03430 WO 87 00195 or U.S. Pat. No. Re. 30 985 may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and or other growth factors such as insulin transferrin or epidermal growth factor salts such as sodium chloride calcium magnesium and phosphate buffers such as HEPES nucleotides such as adenosine and thymidine antibiotics such as GENTAMYCIN drug trace elements defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions such as temperature pH and the like are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.

When using recombinant techniques the antibody can be produced intracellularly or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly as a first step the particulate debris either host cells or lysed fragments are removed for example by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Where the antibody is secreted into the medium supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter for example an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.

The antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using for example hydroxylapatite chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis and affinity chromatography with affinity chromatography being the preferred purification technique. The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human 1 2 or 4 heavy chains Lindmark et al. J. Immunol. Meth. 62 1 13 1983 . Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human 3 Guss et al. EMBO J. 5 15671575 1986 . The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly styrenedivinyl benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a CH3 domain the Bakerbond ABX resin J. T. Baker Phillipsburg N.J. is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion exchange column ethanol precipitation Reverse Phase HPLC chromatography on silica chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin such as a polyaspartic acid column chromatofocusing SDS PAGE and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.

Following any preliminary purification step s the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5 4.5 preferably performed at low salt concentrations e.g. from about 0 0.25M salt .

The invention also provides immunoconjugates interchangeably referred to as antibody drug conjugates or ADCs comprising an antibody conjugated to one or more cytotoxic agents such as a chemotherapeutic agent a drug a growth inhibitory agent a toxin e.g. a protein toxin an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial fungal plant or animal origin or fragments thereof or a radioactive isotope i.e. a radioconjugate .

Immunoconjugates have been used for the local delivery of cytotoxic agents i.e. drugs that kill or inhibit the growth or proliferation of cells in the treatment of cancer Lambert J. 2005 5 543 549 Wu et al 2005 23 9 1137 1146 Payne G. 2003 i 3 207 212 Syrigos and Epenetos 1999 19 605 614 Niculescu Duvaz and Springer 1997 26 151 172 U.S. Pat. No. 4 975 278 . Immunoconjugates allow for the targeted delivery of a drug moiety to a tumor and intracellular accumulation therein where systemic administration of unconjugated drugs may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells as well as the tumor cells sought to be eliminated Baldwin et al. Mar. 15 1986 pp. 603 05 Thorpe 1985 Antibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy A Review in 84 A. Pinchera et al. eds pp. 475 506. Both polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies have been reported as useful in these strategies Rowland et al. 1986 21 183 87 . Drugs used in these methods include daunomycin doxorubicin methotrexate and vindesine Rowland et al. 1986 supra . Toxins used in antibody toxin conjugates include bacterial toxins such as diphtheria toxin plant toxins such as ricin small molecule toxins such as geldanamycin Mandler et al 2000 92 19 1573 1581 Mandler et al 2000 10 1025 1028 Mandler et al 2002 13 786 791 maytansinoids EP 1391213 Liu et al. 1996 93 8618 8623 and calicheamicin Lode et al 1998 58 2928 Hinman et al 1993 53 3336 3342 . The toxins may exert their cytotoxic effects by mechanisms including tubulin binding DNA binding or topoisomerase inhibition. Some cytotoxic drugs tend to be inactive or less active when conjugated to large antibodies or protein receptor ligands.

In certain embodiments an immunoconjugate comprises an antibody and a chemotherapeutic agent or other toxin. Chemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of immunoconjugates are described herein e.g. above . Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof that can be used include diphtheria A chain nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin proteins dianthin proteins proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S inhibitor curcin crotin sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes. See e.g. WO 93 21232 published Oct. 28 1993. A variety of radionuclides are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include Bi I In Y and Re. Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithiol propionate SPDP iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. Science 238 1098 1987 . Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94 11026.

Conjugates of an antibody and one or more small molecule toxins such as a calicheamicin maytansinoids dolastatins aurostatins a trichothecene and CC1065 and the derivatives of these toxins that have toxin activity are also contemplated herein.

In some embodiments the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody full length or fragments conjugated to one or more maytansinoid molecules.

Maytansinoids are mitototic inhibitors which act by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Maytansine was first isolated from the east African shrub U.S. Pat. No. 3 896 111 . Subsequently it was discovered that certain microbes also produce maytansinoids such as maytansinol and C 3 maytansinol esters U.S. Pat. No. 4 151 042 . Synthetic maytansinol and derivatives and analogues thereof are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 137 230 4 248 870 4 256 746 4 260 608 4 265 814 4 294 757 4 307 016 4 308 268 4 308 269 4 309 428 4 313 946 4 315 929 4 317 821 4 322 348 4 331 598 4 361 650 4 364 866 4 424 219 4 450 254 4 362 663 and 4 371 533.

Maytansinoid drug moieties are attractive drug moieties in antibody drug conjugates because they are i relatively accessible to prepare by fermentation or chemical modification derivatization of fermentation products ii amenable to derivatization with functional groups suitable for conjugation through the non disulfide linkers to antibodies iii stable in plasma and iv effective against a variety of tumor cell lines.

Immunoconjugates containing maytansinoids methods of making same and their therapeutic use are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 208 020 5 416 064 and European Patent EP 0 425 235 B1 the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Liu et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93 8618 8623 1996 described immunoconjugates comprising a maytansinoid designated DM1 linked to the monoclonal antibody C242 directed against human colorectal cancer. The conjugate was found to be highly cytotoxic towards cultured colon cancer cells and showed antitumor activity in an in vivo tumor growth assay. Chari et al. Cancer Research 52 127 131 1992 describe immunoconjugates in which a maytansinoid was conjugated via a disulfide linker to the murine antibody A7 binding to an antigen on human colon cancer cell lines or to another murine monoclonal antibody TA.1 that binds the HER 2 neu oncogene. The cytotoxicity of the TA.1 maytansinoid conjugate was tested in vitro on the human breast cancer cell line SK BR 3 which expresses 3 105 HER 2 surface antigens per cell. The drug conjugate achieved a degree of cytotoxicity similar to the free maytansinoid drug which could be increased by increasing the number of maytansinoid molecules per antibody molecule. The A7 maytansinoid conjugate showed low systemic cytotoxicity in mice.

Antibody maytansinoid conjugates are prepared by chemically linking an antibody to a maytansinoid molecule without significantly diminishing the biological activity of either the antibody or the maytansinoid molecule. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 the disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference . An average of 3 4 maytansinoid molecules conjugated per antibody molecule has shown efficacy in enhancing cytotoxicity of target cells without negatively affecting the function or solubility of the antibody although even one molecule of toxin antibody would be expected to enhance cytotoxicity over the use of naked antibody. Maytansinoids are well known in the art and can be synthesized by known techniques or isolated from natural sources. Suitable maytansinoids are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 and in the other patents and nonpatent publications referred to hereinabove. Preferred maytansinoids are maytansinol and maytansinol analogues modified in the aromatic ring or at other positions of the maytansinol molecule such as various maytansinol esters.

There are many linking groups known in the art for making antibody maytansinoid conjugates including for example those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 or EP Patent 0 425 235 B1 Chari et al. Cancer Research 52 127 131 1992 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 960 602 filed Oct. 8 2004 the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Antibody maytansinoid conjugates comprising the linker component SMCC may be prepared as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 960 602 filed Oct. 8 2004. The linking groups include disulfide groups thioether groups acid labile groups photolabile groups peptidase labile groups or esterase labile groups as disclosed in the above identified patents disulfide and thioether groups being preferred. Additional linking groups are described and exemplified herein.

Conjugates of the antibody and maytansinoid may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . Particularly preferred coupling agents include N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP Carlsson et al. Biochem. J. 173 723 737 1978 and N succinimidyl 4 2 pyridylthio pentanoate SPP to provide for a disulfide linkage.

The linker may be attached to the maytansinoid molecule at various positions depending on the type of the link. For example an ester linkage may be formed by reaction with a hydroxyl group using conventional coupling techniques. The reaction may occur at the C 3 position having a hydroxyl group the C 14 position modified with hydroxymethyl the C 15 position modified with a hydroxyl group and the C 20 position having a hydroxyl group. In a preferred embodiment the linkage is formed at the C 3 position of maytansinol or a maytansinol analogue.

In some embodiments the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody conjugated to dolastatins or dolostatin peptidic analogs and derivatives the auristatins U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 635 483 5 780 588 . Dolastatins and auristatins have been shown to interfere with microtubule dynamics GTP hydrolysis and nuclear and cellular division Woyke et al 2001 Antimicrob. Agents and Chemother. 45 12 3580 3584 and have anticancer U.S. Pat. No. 5 663 149 and antifungal activity Pettit et al 1998 Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 42 2961 2965 . The dolastatin or auristatin drug moiety may be attached to the antibody through the N amino terminus or the C carboxyl terminus of the peptidic drug moiety WO 02 088172 .

Exemplary auristatin embodiments include the N terminus linked monomethylauristatin drug moieties DE and DF disclosed in Monomethylvaline Compounds Capable of Conjugation to Ligands U.S. Ser. No. 10 983 340 filed Nov. 5 2004 the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Typically peptide based drug moieties can be prepared by forming a peptide bond between two or more amino acids and or peptide fragments. Such peptide bonds can be prepared for example according to the liquid phase synthesis method see E. Schroder and K. L bke The Peptides volume 1 pp 76 136 1965 Academic Press that is well known in the field of peptide chemistry. The auristatin dolastatin drug moieties may be prepared according to the methods of U.S. Pat. No. 5 635 483 U.S. Pat. No. 5 780 588 Pettit et al 1989 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 111 5463 5465 Pettit et al 1998 Anti Cancer Drug Design 13 243 277 Pettit G. R. et al. Synthesis 1996 719 725 and Pettit et al 1996 J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1 5 859 863. See also Doronina 2003 Nat Biotechnol 21 7 778 784 Monomethylvaline Compounds Capable of Conjugation to Ligands U.S. Ser.

In other embodiments the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody conjugated to one or more calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing double stranded DNA breaks at sub picomolar concentrations. For the preparation of conjugates of the calicheamicin family see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 712 374 5 714 586 5 739 116 5 767 285 5 770 701 5 770 710 5 773 001 5 877 296 all to American Cyanamid Company . Structural analogues of calicheamicin which may be used include but are not limited to 1I 2I 3I N acetyl 1I PSAG and I1 Hinman et al. Cancer Research 53 3336 3342 1993 Lode et al. Cancer Research 58 2925 2928 1998 and the aforementioned U.S. patents to American Cyanamid . Another anti tumor drug that the antibody can be conjugated is QFA which is an antifolate. Both calicheamicin and QFA have intracellular sites of action and do not readily cross the plasma membrane. Therefore cellular uptake of these agents through antibody mediated internalization greatly enhances their cytotoxic effects.

Other antitumor agents that can be conjugated to the antibodies include BCNU streptozoicin vincristine and 5 fluorouracil the family of agents known collectively LL E33288 complex described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 053 394 5 770 710 as well as esperamicins U.S. Pat. No. 5 877 296 .

Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof which can be used include diphtheria A chain nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin proteins dianthin proteins proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S inhibitor curcin crotin sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes. See for example WO 93 21232 published Oct. 28 1993.

The present invention further contemplates an immunoconjugate formed between an antibody and a compound with nucleolytic activity e.g. a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease such as a deoxyribonuclease DNase .

For selective destruction of the tumor the antibody may comprise a highly radioactive atom. A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include At I I Y Re Re Sm Bi P Pband radioactive isotopes of Lu. When the conjugate is used for detection it may comprise a radioactive atom for scintigraphic studies for example tc99m or I123 or a spin label for nuclear magnetic resonance NMR imaging also known as magnetic resonance imaging mri such as iodine 123 again iodine 131 indium 111 fluorine 19 carbon 13 nitrogen 15 oxygen 17 gadolinium manganese or iron.

The radio or other labels may be incorporated in the conjugate in known ways. For example the peptide may be biosynthesized or may be synthesized by chemical amino acid synthesis using suitable amino acid precursors involving for example fluorine 19 in place of hydrogen. Labels such as tcm or I Re Reand Incan be attached via a cysteine residue in the peptide. Yttrium 90 can be attached via a lysine residue. The IODOGEN method Fraker et al 1978 Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 80 49 57 can be used to incorporate iodine 123. Monoclonal Antibodies in Immunoscintigraphy Chatal CRC Press 1989 describes other methods in detail.

Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. Science 238 1098 1987 . Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94 11026. The linker may be a cleavable linker facilitating release of the cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example an acid labile linker peptidase sensitive linker photolabile linker dimethyl linker or disulfide containing linker Chari et al. Cancer Research 52 127 131 1992 U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 may be used.

The compounds expressly contemplate but are not limited to ADC prepared with cross linker reagents BMPS EMCS GMBS HBVS LC SMCC MBS MPBH SBAP SIA SLAB SMCC SMPB SMPH sulfo EMCS sulfo GMBS sulfo KMUS sulfo MBS sulfo SIAB sulfo SMCC and sulfo SMPB and SVSB succinimidyl 4 vinylsulfone benzoate which are commercially available e.g. from Pierce Biotechnology Inc. Rockford Ill. U.S.A . See pages 467 498 2003 2004 Applications Handbook and Catalog.

In the antibody drug conjugates ADC an antibody Ab is conjugated to one or more drug moieties D e.g. about 1 to about 20 drug moieties per antibody through a linker L . The ADC of Formula I may be prepared by several routes employing organic chemistry reactions conditions and reagents known to those skilled in the art including 1 reaction of a nucleophilic group of an antibody with a bivalent linker reagent to form Ab L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with a drug moiety D and 2 reaction of a nucleophilic group of a drug moiety with a bivalent linker reagent to form D L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with the nucleophilic group of an antibody. Additional methods for preparing ADC are described herein. Ab L D I

The linker may be composed of one or more linker components. Exemplary linker components include 6 maleimidocaproyl MC maleimidopropanoyl MP valine citrulline val cit alanine phenylalanine ala phe p aminobenzyloxycarbonyl PAB N Succinimidyl 4 2 pyridylthio pentanoate SPP N Succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC and N Succinimidyl 4 iodo acetyl aminobenzoate SIAB . Additional linker components are known in the art and some are described herein. See also Monomethylvaline Compounds Capable of Conjugation to Ligands U.S. Ser. No. 10 983 340 filed Nov. 5 2004 the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

In some embodiments the linker may comprise amino acid residues. Exemplary amino acid linker components include a dipeptide a tripeptide a tetrapeptide or a pentapeptide. Exemplary dipeptides include valine citrulline vc or val cit alanine phenylalanine af or ala phe . Exemplary tripeptides include glycine valine citrulline gly val cit and glycine glycine glycine gly gly gly . Amino acid residues which comprise an amino acid linker component include those occurring naturally as well as minor amino acids and non naturally occurring amino acid analogs such as citrulline. Amino acid linker components can be designed and optimized in their selectivity for enzymatic cleavage by a particular enzymes for example a tumor associated protease cathepsin B C and D or a plasmin protease.

Nucleophilic groups on antibodies include but are not limited to i N terminal amine groups ii side chain amine groups e.g. lysine iii side chain thiol groups e.g. cysteine and iv sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine thiol and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT dithiothreitol . Each cysteine bridge will thus form theoretically two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2 iminothiolane Traut s reagent resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol. Reactive thiol groups may be introduced into the antibody or fragment thereof by introducing one two three four or more cysteine residues e.g. preparing mutant antibodies comprising one or more non native cysteine amino acid residues .

Antibody drug conjugates may also be produced by modification of the antibody to introduce electrophilic moieties which can react with nucleophilic substituents on the linker reagent or drug. The sugars of glycosylated antibodies may be oxidized e.g. with periodate oxidizing reagents to form aldehyde or ketone groups which may react with the amine group of linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting imine Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage or may be reduced e.g. by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated antibody with either galactose oxidase or sodium meta periodate may yield carbonyl aldehyde and ketone groups in the protein that can react with appropriate groups on the drug Hermanson Bioconjugate Techniques . In another embodiment proteins containing N terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium meta periodate resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid Geoghegan Stroh 1992 3 138 146 U.S. Pat. No. 5 362 852 . Such aldehyde can be reacted with a drug moiety or linker nucleophile.

Likewise nucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include but are not limited to amine thiol hydroxyl hydrazide oxime hydrazine thiosemicarbazone hydrazine carboxylate and arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups.

Alternatively a fusion protein comprising the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made e.g. by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. The length of DNA may comprise respective regions encoding the two portions of the conjugate either adjacent one another or separated by a region encoding a linker peptide which does not destroy the desired properties of the conjugate.

In yet another embodiment the antibody may be conjugated to a receptor such streptavidin for utilization in tumor pre targeting wherein the antibody receptor conjugate is administered to the patient followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a ligand e.g. avidin which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent e.g. a radionucleotide .

Therapeutic formulations comprising an antibody of the invention are prepared for storage by mixing the antibody having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers 20th edition 2000 in the form of aqueous solutions lyophilized or other dried formulations. Acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and include buffers such as phosphate citrate histidine and other organic acids antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine preservatives such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride hexamethonium chloride benzalkonium chloride benzethonium chloride phenol butyl or benzyl alcohol alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben catechol resorcinol cyclohexanol 3 pentanol and m cresol low molecular weight less than about 10 residues polypeptides proteins such as serum albumin gelatin or immunoglobulins hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone amino acids such as glycine glutamine asparagine histidine arginine or lysine monosaccharides disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose mannose or dextrins chelating agents such as EDTA sugars such as sucrose mannitol trehalose or sorbitol salt forming counter ions such as sodium metal complexes e.g. Zn protein complexes and or non ionic surfactants such as TWEEN PLURONICS or polyethylene glycol PEG .

The formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.

The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsule prepared for example by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization for example hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin microcapsule and poly methylmethacylate microcapsule respectively in colloidal drug delivery systems for example liposomes albumin microspheres microemulsions nano particles and nanocapsules or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in 20th edition 2000 .

The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.

Sustained release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the immunoglobulin of the invention which matrices are in the form of shaped articles e.g. films or microcapsule. Examples of sustained release matrices include polyesters hydrogels for example poly 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate or poly vinylalcohol polylactides U.S. Pat. No. 3 773 919 copolymers of L glutamic acid and ethyl L glutamate non degradable ethylene vinyl acetate degradable lactic acid glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate and poly D 3 hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene vinyl acetate and lactic acid glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated immunoglobulins remain in the body for a long time they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37 C. resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S S bond formation through thio disulfide interchange stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues lyophilizing from acidic solutions controlling moisture content using appropriate additives and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.

Thus the combined administration of a second medicament includes co administration concurrent administration using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation and consecutive administration in either order wherein preferably there is a time period while both or all medicaments simultaneously exert their biological activities. All these second medicaments may be used in combination with each other or by themselves with the first medicament so that the express second medicament as used herein does not mean it is the only medicament besides the first medicament respectively. Thus the second medicament need not be one medicament but may constitute or comprise more than one such drug.

These second medicaments as set forth herein are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as the first medicaments or about from 1 to 99 of the dosages of the first medicaments. If such second medicaments are used at all preferably they are used in lower amounts than if the first medicament were not present especially in subsequent dosings beyond the initial dosing with the first medicament so as to eliminate or reduce side effects caused thereby.

The invention also provides methods and compositions for inhibiting or preventing relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth. Relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth is used to describe a condition in which patients undergoing or treated with one or more currently available therapies e.g. cancer therapies such as chemotherapy radiation therapy surgery hormonal therapy and or biological therapy immunotherapy anti VEGF antibody therapy particularly a standard therapeutic regimen for the particular cancer is not clinically adequate to treat the patients or the patients are no longer receiving any beneficial effect from the therapy such that these patients need additional effective therapy. As used herein the phrase can also refer to a condition of the non responsive refractory patient e.g. which describe patients who respond to therapy yet suffer from side effects develop resistance do not respond to the therapy do not respond satisfactorily to the therapy etc. In various embodiments a cancer is relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth where the number of cancer cells has not been significantly reduced or has increased or tumor size has not been significantly reduced or has increased or fails any further reduction in size or in number of cancer cells. The determination of whether the cancer cells are relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth can be made either in vivo or in vitro by any method known in the art for assaying the effectiveness of treatment on cancer cells using the art accepted meanings of relapse or refractory or non responsive in such a context. A tumor resistant to anti VEGF treatment is an example of a relapse tumor growth.

The invention provides methods of blocking or reducing relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth in a subject by administering one or more anti FGF19 antibody to block or reduce the relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth in subject. In certain embodiments the antagonist can be administered subsequent to the cancer therapeutic. In certain embodiments the anti FGF19 antibody is administered simultaneously with cancer therapy. Alternatively or additionally the anti FGF19 antibody therapy alternates with another cancer therapy which can be performed in any order. The invention also encompasses methods for administering one or more inhibitory antibodies to prevent the onset or recurrence of cancer in patients predisposed to having cancer. Generally the subject was or is concurrently undergoing cancer therapy. In one embodiment the cancer therapy is treatment with an anti angiogenesis agent e.g. a VEGF antagonist. The anti angiogenesis agent includes those known in the art and those found under the Definitions herein. In one embodiment the anti angiogenesis agent is an anti VEGF neutralizing antibody or fragment e.g. humanized A4.6.1 AVASTIN Genentech South San Francisco Calif. Y0317 M4 G6 B20 2C3 etc. . See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 582 959 6 884 879 6 703 020 WO98 45332 WO 96 30046 WO94 10202 EP 0666868B1 US Patent Applications 20030206899 20030190317 20030203409 and 20050112126 Popkov et al. Journal of Immunological Methods 288 149 164 2004 and WO2005012359. Additional agents can be administered in combination with VEGF antagonist and an anti FGF19 antibody for blocking or reducing relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth.

The antibodies of the invention and adjunct therapeutic agent is are administered by any suitable means including parenteral subcutaneous intraperitoneal intrapulmonary and intranasal and if desired for local treatment intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular intravenous intraarterial intraperitoneal or subcutaneous administration. In addition the antibodies are suitably administered by pulse infusion particularly with declining doses of the antibody. Dosing can be by any suitable route e.g. by injections such as intravenous or subcutaneous injections depending in part on whether the administration is brief or chronic.

The location of the binding target of an antibody of the invention may be taken into consideration in preparation and administration of the antibody. When the binding target is an intracellular molecule certain embodiments of the invention provide for the antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof to be introduced into the cell where the binding target is located. In one embodiment an antibody of the invention can be expressed intracellularly as an intrabody. The term intrabody as used herein refers to an antibody or antigen binding portion thereof that is expressed intracellularly and that is capable of selectively binding to a target molecule as described e.g. in Marasco 4 11 15 1997 Kontermann 34 163 170 2004 U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 004 940 and 6 329 173 U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003 0104402 and PCT Publication No. WO2003 077945. See also for example WO96 07321 published Mar. 14 1996 concerning the use of gene therapy to generate intracellular antibodies.

Intracellular expression of an intrabody may be effected by introducing a nucleic acid encoding the desired antibody or antigen binding portion thereof lacking the wild type leader sequence and secretory signals normally associated with the gene encoding that antibody or antigen binding fragment into a target cell. One or more nucleic acids encoding all or a portion of an antibody of the invention can be delivered to a target cell such that one or more intrabodies are expressed which are capable of binding to an intracellular target polypeptide and modulating the activity of the target polypeptide. Any standard method of introducing nucleic acids into a cell may be used including but not limited to microinjection ballistic injection electroporation calcium phosphate precipitation liposomes and transfection with retroviral adenoviral adeno associated viral and vaccinia vectors carrying the nucleic acid of interest.

In certain embodiments nucleic acid optionally contained in a vector may be introduced into a patient s cells by in vivo and ex vivo methods. In one example of in vivo delivery nucleic acid is injected directly into the patient e.g. at the site where therapeutic intervention is required. In a further example of in vivo delivery nucleic acid is introduced into a cell using transfection with viral vectors such as adenovirus Herpes simplex I virus or adeno associated virus and lipid based systems useful lipids for lipid mediated transfer of the gene are DOTMA DOPE and DC Chol for example . For review of certain gene marking and gene therapy protocols see Anderson et al. 256 808 813 1992 and WO 93 25673 and the references cited therein. In an example of ex vivo treatment a patient s cells are removed nucleic acid is introduced into those isolated cells and the modified cells are administered to the patient either directly or for example encapsulated within porous membranes which are implanted into the patient see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 892 538 and 5 283 187 . A commonly used vector for ex vivo delivery of a nucleic acid is a retroviral vector.

In another embodiment internalizing antibodies are provided. Antibodies can possess certain characteristics that enhance delivery of antibodies into cells or can be modified to possess such characteristics. Techniques for achieving this are known in the art. For example cationization of an antibody is known to facilitate its uptake into cells see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 703 019 . Lipofections or liposomes can also be used to deliver the antibody into cells. Where antibody fragments are used the smallest inhibitory fragment that specifically binds to the target protein may be advantageous. For example based upon the variable region sequences of an antibody peptide molecules can be designed that retain the ability to bind the target protein sequence. Such peptides can be synthesized chemically and or produced by recombinant DNA technology. See e.g. Marasco et al. 90 7889 7893 1993 .

Entry of antibodies into target cells can be enhanced by other methods known in the art. For example certain sequences such as those derived from HIV Tat or the Antennapedia homeodomain protein are able to direct efficient uptake of heterologous proteins across cell membranes. See e.g. Chen et al. 1999 96 4325 4329.

When the binding target of an antibody is located in the brain certain embodiments of the invention provide for the antibody to traverse the blood brain barrier. Several art known approaches exist for transporting molecules across the blood brain barrier including but not limited to physical methods lipid based methods stem cell based methods and receptor and channel based methods.

Physical methods of transporting an antibody across the blood brain barrier include but are not limited to circumventing the blood brain barrier entirely or by creating openings in the blood brain barrier. Circumvention methods include but are not limited to direct injection into the brain see e.g. Papanastassiou et al. 9 398 406 2002 interstitial infusion convection enhanced delivery see e.g. Bobo et al. 91 2076 2080 1994 and implanting a delivery device in the brain see e.g. Gill et al. 9 589 595 2003 and Gliadel Wafers Guildford Pharmaceutical . Methods of creating openings in the barrier include but are not limited to ultrasound see e.g. U.S. Patent Publication No. 2002 0038086 osmotic pressure e.g. by administration of hypertonic mannitol Neuwelt E. A. Vols 1 2 Plenum Press N.Y. 1989 permeabilization by e.g. bradykinin or permeabilizer A 7 see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 112 596 5 268 164 5 506 206 and 5 686 416 and transfection of neurons that straddle the blood brain barrier with vectors containing genes encoding the antibody see e.g. U.S. Patent Publication No. 2003 0083299 .

Lipid based methods of transporting an antibody across the blood brain barrier include but are not limited to encapsulating the antibody in liposomes that are coupled to antibody binding fragments that bind to receptors on the vascular endothelium of the blood brain barrier see e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20020025313 and coating the antibody in low density lipoprotein particles see e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20040204354 or apolipoprotein E see e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20040131692 .

Stem cell based methods of transporting an antibody across the blood brain barrier entail genetically engineering neural progenitor cells NPCs to express the antibody of interest and then implanting the stem cells into the brain of the individual to be treated. See Behrstock et al. 2005 15 Dec. 2005 advanced online publication reporting that NPCs genetically engineered to express the neurotrophic factor GDNF reduced symptoms of Parkinson disease when implanted into the brains of rodent and primate models .

Receptor and channel based methods of transporting an antibody across the blood brain barrier include but are not limited to using glucocorticoid blockers to increase permeability of the blood brain barrier see e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2002 0065259 2003 0162695 and 2005 0124533 activating potassium channels see e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005 0089473 inhibiting ABC drug transporters see e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003 0073713 coating antibodies with a transferrin and modulating activity of the one or more transferrin receptors see e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003 0129186 and cationizing the antibodies see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 004 697 .

Antibodies of the invention would be formulated dosed and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated the particular mammal being treated the clinical condition of the individual patient the cause of the disorder the site of delivery of the agent the method of administration the scheduling of administration and other factors known to medical practitioners. The antibody need not be but is optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat the disorder in question. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of antibody present in the formulation the type of disorder or treatment and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as described herein or about from 1 to 99 of the dosages described herein or in any dosage and by any route that is empirically clinically determined to be appropriate.

For the prevention or treatment of disease the appropriate dosage of an antibody of the invention when used alone or in combination with one or more other additional therapeutic agents will depend on the type of disease to be treated the type of antibody the severity and course of the disease whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes previous therapy the patient s clinical history and response to the antibody and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease about 1 g kg to 15 mg kg e.g. 0.1 mg kg 10 mg kg of antibody can be an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient whether for example by one or more separate administrations or by continuous infusion. One typical daily dosage might range from about 1 g kg to 100 mg kg or more depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer depending on the condition the treatment would generally be sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. One exemplary dosage of the antibody would be in the range from about 0.05 mg kg to about 10 mg kg. Thus one or more doses of about 0.5 mg kg 2.0 mg kg 4.0 mg kg or 10 mg kg or any combination thereof may be administered to the patient. Such doses may be administered intermittently e.g. every week or every three weeks e.g. such that the patient receives from about two to about twenty or e.g. about six doses of the antibody . An initial higher loading dose followed by one or more lower doses may be administered. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg kg followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg kg of the antibody. However other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.

The anti FGF19 antibodies of the invention are useful in assays detecting FGF19 expression such as diagnostic or prognostic assays in specific cells or tissues wherein the antibodies are labeled as described below and or are immobilized on an insoluble matrix. However it is understood that any suitable anti FGF19 antibody may be used in embodiments involving detection and diagnosis. Some methods for making anti FGF19 antibodies are described herein and methods for making anti FGF19 antibodies are well known in the art.

In another aspect the invention provides methods for detection of FGF19 the methods comprising detecting FGF19 anti FGF19 antibody complex in the sample. The term detection as used herein includes qualitative and or quantitative detection measuring levels with or without reference to a control.

In another aspect the invention provides methods for diagnosing a disorder associated with FGF19 expression and or activity the methods comprising detecting FGF19 anti FGF19 antibody complex in a biological sample from an individual having or suspected of having the disorder.

In another aspect the invention provides a complex of any of the anti FGF19 antibodies described herein and FGF19. In some embodiments the complex is in vivo or in vitro. In some embodiments the complex comprises a cancer cell. In some embodiments the anti FGF19 antibody is detectably labeled.

Anti FGF19 antibodies e.g. any of the FGF19 antibodies described herein can be used for the detection of FGF19 in any one of a number of well known detection assay methods.

In one aspect the invention provides methods for detecting a disorder associated with FGF19 expression and or activity the methods comprising detecting FGF19 in a biological sample from an individual. In some embodiments the FGF19 expression is increased expression or abnormal expression. In some embodiments the disorder is a tumor cancer and or a cell proliferative disorder such as colorectal cancer lung cancer hepatocellular carcinoma breast cancer and or pancreatic cancer. In some embodiment the biological sample is serum or of a tumor.

In another aspect the invention provides methods for selecting treatment for an individual the methods comprising a detecting FGF19 expression in an individual s biological sample if any and b subsequence to step a selecting treatment for the individual wherein the selection of treatment is based on the FGF19 expression detected in step a . In some embodiments increased FGF19 expression in the individual s biological sample relative to a reference value or control sample is detected. In some embodiments decreased FGF19 expression in the individual s biological sample relative to a reference value or control sample is detected in the individual. In some embodiments FGF19 expression is detected and treatment with an anti FGF19 antibody is selected.

In another aspect the invention provides methods for treating an individual having or suspected of having a cancer a tumor and or a cell proliferative disorder or a liver disorder such as cirrhosis by administering an effective amount of an anti FGF19 antibody further wherein FGF19 expression and or FGFR4 is detected in cells and or tissue from the human patient before during or after administration of an anti FGF19 antibody. In some embodiments FGF19 over expression is detected before during and or after administration of an anti FGF19 antibody. In some embodiments FGFR4 expression is detected before during and or after administration of an anti FGF19 antibody. Expression may be detected before during after before and during before and after during and after or before during and after administration of an anti FGF19 antibody. Methods of treating a disorder with an anti FGF19 antibody are described herein and some methods are exemplified herein.

For example a biological sample may be assayed for FGF19 by obtaining the sample from a desired source admixing the sample with anti FGF19 antibody to allow the antibody to form antibody FGF19 complex with any FGF19 present in the mixture and detecting any antibody FGF19 complex present in the mixture. The biological sample may be prepared for assay by methods known in the art which are suitable for the particular sample. The methods of admixing the sample with antibodies and the methods of detecting antibody FGF19 complex are chosen according to the type of assay used. Such assays include immunohistochemistry competitive and sandwich assays and steric inhibition assays. For sample preparation a tissue or cell sample from a mammal typically a human patient may be used. Examples of samples include but are not limited to cancer cells such as colon breast prostate ovary lung stomach pancreas lymphoma and leukemia cancer cells. FGF19 may also be measured in serum. The sample can be obtained by a variety of procedures known in the art including but not limited to surgical excision aspiration or biopsy. The tissue may be fresh or frozen. In one embodiment the sample is fixed and embedded in paraffin or the like. The tissue sample may be fixed i.e. preserved by conventional methodology See e.g. Manual of Histological Staining Method of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology 3edition 1960 Lee G. Luna H T ASCP Editor The Blakston Division McGraw Hill Book Company New York 1994 Ulreka V. Mikel Editor Armed Forces Institute of Pathology American Registry of Pathology Washington D.C. . One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the choice of a fixative is determined by the purpose for which the sample is to be histologically stained or otherwise analyzed. One of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate that the length of fixation depends upon the size of the tissue sample and the fixative used. By way of example neutral buffered formalin Bouin s or paraformaldehyde may be used to fix a sample. Generally the sample is first fixed and is then dehydrated through an ascending series of alcohols infiltrated and embedded with paraffin or other sectioning media so that the tissue sample may be sectioned. Alternatively one may section the tissue and fix the sections obtained. By way of example the tissue sample may be embedded and processed in paraffin by conventional methodology See e.g. Manual of Histological Staining Method of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology supra . Examples of paraffin that may be used include but are not limited to Paraplast Broloid and Tissuemay. Once the tissue sample is embedded the sample may be sectioned by a microtome or the like See e.g. Manual of Histological Staining Method of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology supra . By way of example for this procedure sections may range from about three microns to about five microns in thickness. Once sectioned the sections may be attached to slides by several standard methods. Examples of slide adhesives include but are not limited to silane gelatin poly L lysine and the like. By way of example the paraffin embedded sections may be attached to positively charged slides and or slides coated with poly L lysine. If paraffin has been used as the embedding material the tissue sections are generally deparaffinized and rehydrated to water. The tissue sections may be deparaffinized by several conventional standard methodologies. For example xylenes and a gradually descending series of alcohols may be used See e.g. Manual of Histological Staining Method of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology supra . Alternatively commercially available deparaffinizing non organic agents such as Hemo De7 CMS Houston Tex. may be used.

Analytical methods for FGF19 all use one or more of the following reagents labeled FGF19 analogue immobilized FGF19 analogue labeled anti FGF19 antibody immobilized anti FGF19 antibody and steric conjugates. The labeled reagents also are known as tracers. 

The label used is any detectable functionality that does not interfere with the binding of FGF19 and anti FGF19 antibody. Numerous labels are known for use in immunoassay examples including moieties that may be detected directly such as fluorochrome chemiluminescent and radioactive labels as well as moieties such as enzymes that must be reacted or derivatized to be detected.

The label used is any detectable functionality that does not interfere with the binding of FGF19 and anti FGF19 antibody. Numerous labels are known for use in immunoassay examples including moieties that may be detected directly such as fluorochrome chemiluminescent and radioactive labels as well as moieties such as enzymes that must be reacted or derivatized to be detected. Examples of such labels include the radioisotopes P C I H and I fluorophores such as rare earth chelates or fluorescein and its derivatives rhodamine and its derivatives dansyl umbelliferone luceriferases e.g. firefly luciferase and bacterial luciferase U.S. Pat. No. 4 737 456 luciferin 2 3 dihydrophthalazinediones horseradish peroxidase HRP alkaline phosphatase galactosidase glucoamylase lysozyme saccharide oxidases e.g. glucose oxidase galactose oxidase and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase heterocyclic oxidases such as uricase and xanthine oxidase coupled with an enzyme that employs hydrogen peroxide to oxidize a dye precursor such as HRP lactoperoxidase or microperoxidase biotin avidin spin labels bacteriophage labels stable free radicals and the like.

Conventional methods are available to bind these labels covalently to proteins or polypeptides. For instance coupling agents such as dialdehydes carbodiimides dimaleimides bis imidates bis diazotized benzidine and the like may be used to tag the antibodies with the above described fluorescent chemiluminescent and enzyme labels. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 3 940 475 fluorimetry and U.S. Pat. No. 3 645 090 enzymes Hunter et al. 144 945 1962 David et al. 13 1014 1021 1974 Pain et al. 40 219 230 1981 and Nygren 30 407 412 1982 . Preferred labels herein are enzymes such as horseradish peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase. The conjugation of such label including the enzymes to the antibody is a standard manipulative procedure for one of ordinary skill in immunoassay techniques. See for example O Sullivan et al. Methods for the Preparation of Enzyme antibody Conjugates for Use in Enzyme Immunoassay in ed. J. J. Langone and H. Van Vunakis Vol. 73 Academic Press New York N.Y. 1981 pp. 147 166.

Immobilization of reagents is required for certain assay methods. Immobilization entails separating the anti FGF19 antibody from any FGF19 that remains free in solution. This conventionally is accomplished by either insolubilizing the anti FGF19 antibody or FGF19 analogue before the assay procedure as by adsorption to a water insoluble matrix or surface Bennich et al. U.S. Pat. No. 3 720 760 by covalent coupling for example using glutaraldehyde cross linking or by insolubilizing the anti FGF19 antibody or FGF19 analogue afterward e.g. by immunoprecipitation.

The expression of proteins in a sample may be examined using immunohistochemistry and staining protocols. Immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections has been shown to be a reliable method of assessing or detecting presence of proteins in a sample. Immunohistochemistry IHC techniques utilize an antibody to probe and visualize cellular antigens in situ generally by chromogenic or fluorescent methods. For sample preparation a tissue or cell sample from a mammal typically a human patient may be used. The sample can be obtained by a variety of procedures known in the art including but not limited to surgical excision aspiration or biopsy. The tissue may be fresh or frozen. In one embodiment the sample is fixed and embedded in paraffin or the like. The tissue sample may be fixed i.e. preserved by conventional methodology. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the choice of a fixative is determined by the purpose for which the sample is to be histologically stained or otherwise analyzed. One of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate that the length of fixation depends upon the size of the tissue sample and the fixative used.

IHC may be performed in combination with additional techniques such as morphological staining and or fluorescence in situ hybridization. Two general methods of IHC are available direct and indirect assays. According to the first assay binding of antibody to the target antigen e.g. FGF19 is determined directly. This direct assay uses a labeled reagent such as a fluorescent tag or an enzyme labeled primary antibody which can be visualized without further antibody interaction. In a typical indirect assay unconjugated primary antibody binds to the antigen and then a labeled secondary antibody binds to the primary antibody. Where the secondary antibody is conjugated to an enzymatic label a chromogenic or fluorogenic substrate is added to provide visualization of the antigen. Signal amplification occurs because several secondary antibodies may react with different epitopes on the primary antibody.

The primary and or secondary antibody used for immunohistochemistry typically will be labeled with a detectable moiety. Numerous labels are available which can be generally grouped into the following categories 

Aside from the sample preparation procedures discussed above further treatment of the tissue section prior to during or following IHC may be desired For example epitope retrieval methods such as heating the tissue sample in citrate buffer may be carried out see e.g. Leong et al. 4 3 201 1996 .

Following an optional blocking step the tissue section is exposed to primary antibody for a sufficient period of time and under suitable conditions such that the primary antibody binds to the target protein antigen in the tissue sample. Appropriate conditions for achieving this can be determined by routine experimentation. The extent of binding of antibody to the sample is determined by using any one of the detectable labels discussed above. Preferably the label is an enzymatic label e.g. HRPO which catalyzes a chemical alteration of the chromogenic substrate such as 3 3 diaminobenzidine chromogen. Preferably the enzymatic label is conjugated to antibody which binds specifically to the primary antibody e.g. the primary antibody is rabbit polyclonal antibody and secondary antibody is goat anti rabbit antibody .

Specimens thus prepared may be mounted and coverslipped. Slide evaluation is then determined e.g. using a microscope and staining intensity criteria routinely used in the art may be employed.

Other assay methods known as competitive or sandwich assays are well established and widely used in the commercial diagnostics industry.

Competitive assays rely on the ability of a tracer FGF19 analogue to compete with the test sample FGF19 for a limited number of anti FGF19 antibody antigen binding sites. The anti FGF19 antibody generally is insolubilized before or after the competition and then the tracer and FGF19 bound to the anti FGF19 antibody are separated from the unbound tracer and FGF19. This separation is accomplished by decanting where the binding partner was preinsolubilized or by centrifuging where the binding partner was precipitated after the competitive reaction . The amount of test sample FGF19 is inversely proportional to the amount of bound tracer as measured by the amount of marker substance. Dose response curves with known amounts of FGF19 are prepared and compared with the test results to quantitatively determine the amount of FGF19 present in the test sample. These assays are called ELISA systems when enzymes are used as the detectable markers.

Another species of competitive assay called a homogeneous assay does not require a phase separation. Here a conjugate of an enzyme with the FGF19 is prepared and used such that when anti FGF19 antibody binds to the FGF19 the presence of the anti FGF19 antibody modifies the enzyme activity. In this case the FGF19 or its immunologically active fragments are conjugated with a bifunctional organic bridge to an enzyme such as peroxidase. Conjugates are selected for use with anti FGF19 antibody so that binding of the anti FGF19 antibody inhibits or potentiates the enzyme activity of the label. This method per se is widely practiced under the name of EMIT.

Steric conjugates are used in steric hindrance methods for homogeneous assay. These conjugates are synthesized by covalently linking a low molecular weight hapten to a small FGF19 fragment so that antibody to hapten is substantially unable to bind the conjugate at the same time as anti FGF19 antibody. Under this assay procedure the FGF19 present in the test sample will bind anti FGF19 antibody thereby allowing anti hapten to bind the conjugate resulting in a change in the character of the conjugate hapten e.g. a change in fluorescence when the hapten is a fluorophore.

Sandwich assays particularly are useful for the determination of FGF19 or anti FGF19 antibodies. In sequential sandwich assays an immobilized anti FGF19 antibody is used to adsorb test sample FGF19 the test sample is removed as by washing the bound FGF19 is used to adsorb a second labeled anti FGF19 antibody and bound material is then separated from residual tracer. The amount of bound tracer is directly proportional to test sample FGF19. In simultaneous sandwich assays the test sample is not separated before adding the labeled anti FGF19. A sequential sandwich assay using an anti FGF19 monoclonal antibody as one antibody and a polyclonal anti FGF19 antibody as the other is useful in testing samples for FGF19.

The foregoing are merely exemplary detection assays for FGF19. Other methods now or hereafter developed that use anti FGF19 antibody for the determination of FGF19 are included within the scope hereof including the bioassays described herein.

In one aspect the invention provides methods to detect e.g. presence or absence of or amount a polynucleotide s e.g. FGF19 polynucleotides in a biological sample from an individual such as a human subject. A variety of methods for detecting polynucleotides can be employed and include for example RT PCR taqman amplification methods polynucleotide microarray and the like.

Methods for the detection of polynucleotides such as mRNA are well known and include for example hybridization assays using complementary DNA probes such as in situ hybridization using labeled FGF19 riboprobes Northern blot and related techniques and various nucleic acid amplification assays such as RT PCR using complementary primers specific for FGF19 and other amplification type detection methods such as for example branched DNA SPIA Ribo SPIA SISBA TMA and the like .

Biological samples from mammals can be conveniently assayed for e.g. FGF19 mRNAs using Northern dot blot or PCR analysis. For example RT PCR assays such as quantitative PCR assays are well known in the art. In an illustrative embodiment of the invention a method for detecting FGF19 mRNA in a biological sample comprises producing cDNA from the sample by reverse transcription using at least one primer amplifying the cDNA so produced using an FGF19 polynucleotide as sense and antisense primers to amplify FGF19 cDNAs therein and detecting the presence or absence of the amplified FGF19 cDNA. In addition such methods can include one or more steps that allow one to determine the amount levels of FGF19 mRNA in a biological sample e.g. by simultaneously examining the levels a comparative control mRNA sequence of a housekeeping gene such as an actin family member . Optionally the sequence of the amplified FGF19 cDNA can be determined.

Probes and or primers may be labeled with a detectable marker such as for example a radioisotope fluorescent compound bioluminescent compound a chemiluminescent compound metal chelator or enzyme. Such probes and primers can be used to detect the presence of FGF 19 polynucleotides in a sample and as a means for detecting a cell expressing FGF19 proteins. As will be understood by the skilled artisan a great many different primers and probes may be prepared e.g. based on the sequences provided in herein and used effectively to amplify clone and or determine the presence or absence of and or amount of FGF19 mRNAs.

Optional methods of the invention include protocols comprising detection of polynucleotides such as FGF19 polynucleotide in a tissue or cell sample using microarray technologies. For example using nucleic acid microarrays test and control mRNA samples from test and control tissue samples are reverse transcribed and labeled to generate cDNA probes. The probes are then hybridized to an array of nucleic acids immobilized on a solid support. The array is configured such that the sequence and position of each member of the array is known. For example a selection of genes that have potential to be expressed in certain disease states may be arrayed on a solid support. Hybridization of a labeled probe with a particular array member indicates that the sample from which the probe was derived expresses that gene. Differential gene expression analysis of disease tissue can provide valuable information. Microarray technology utilizes nucleic acid hybridization techniques and computing technology to evaluate the mRNA expression profile of thousands of genes within a single experiment. see e.g. WO 01 75166 published Oct. 11 2001 See for example U.S. Pat. No. 5 700 637 U.S. Pat. No. 5 445 934 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 807 522 Lockart Nature Biotechnology 14 1675 1680 1996 Cheung V. G. et al. Nature Genetics 21 Suppl 15 19 1999 for a discussion of array fabrication . DNA microarrays are miniature arrays containing gene fragments that are either synthesized directly onto or spotted onto glass or other substrates. Thousands of genes are usually represented in a single array. A typical microarray experiment involves the following steps 1. preparation of fluorescently labeled target from RNA isolated from the sample 2. hybridization of the labeled target to the microarray 3. washing staining and scanning of the array 4. analysis of the scanned image and 5. generation of gene expression profiles. Currently two main types of DNA microarrays are being used oligonucleotide usually 25 to 70 mers arrays and gene expression arrays containing PCR products prepared from cDNAs. In forming an array oligonucleotides can be either prefabricated and spotted to the surface or directly synthesized on to the surface in situ .

The Affymetrix GeneChip system is a commercially available microarray system which comprises arrays fabricated by direct synthesis of oligonucleotides on a glass surface. Probe Gene Arrays Oligonucleotides usually 25 mers are directly synthesized onto a glass wafer by a combination of semiconductor based photolithography and solid phase chemical synthesis technologies. Each array contains up to 400 000 different oligos and each oligo is present in millions of copies. Since oligonucleotide probes are synthesized in known locations on the array the hybridization patterns and signal intensities can be interpreted in terms of gene identity and relative expression levels by the Affymetrix Microarray Suite software. Each gene is represented on the array by a series of different oligonucleotide probes. Each probe pair consists of a perfect match oligonucleotide and a mismatch oligonucleotide. The perfect match probe has a sequence exactly complimentary to the particular gene and thus measures the expression of the gene. The mismatch probe differs from the perfect match probe by a single base substitution at the center base position disturbing the binding of the target gene transcript. This helps to determine the background and nonspecific hybridization that contributes to the signal measured for the perfect match oligo. The Microarray Suite software subtracts the hybridization intensities of the mismatch probes from those of the perfect match probes to determine the absolute or specific intensity value for each probe set. Probes are chosen based on current information from GenBank and other nucleotide repositories. The sequences are believed to recognize unique regions of the 3 end of the gene. A GeneChip Hybridization Oven rotisserie oven is used to carry out the hybridization of up to 64 arrays at one time. The fluidics station performs washing and staining of the probe arrays. It is completely automated and contains four modules with each module holding one probe array. Each module is controlled independently through Microarray Suite software using preprogrammed fluidics protocols. The scanner is a confocal laser fluorescence scanner which measures fluorescence intensity emitted by the labeled cRNA bound to the probe arrays. The computer workstation with Microarray Suite software controls the fluidics station and the scanner. Microarray Suite software can control up to eight fluidics stations using preprogrammed hybridization wash and stain protocols for the probe array. The software also acquires and converts hybridization intensity data into a presence absence call for each gene using appropriate algorithms. Finally the software detects changes in gene expression between experiments by comparison analysis and formats the output into .txt files which can be used with other software programs for further data analysis.

In some embodiments FGF19 gene deletion gene mutation or gene amplification is detected. Gene deletion gene mutation or amplification may be measured by any one of a wide variety of protocols known in the art for example by conventional Southern blotting Northern blotting to quantitate the transcription of mRNA Thomas Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77 5201 5205 1980 dot blotting DNA analysis or in situ hybridization e.g. FISH using an appropriately labeled probe cytogenetic methods or comparative genomic hybridization CGH using an appropriately labeled probe. In addition these methods may be employed to detect FGF19 ligand gene deletion ligand mutation or gene amplification. As used herein detecting FGF19 expression encompasses detection of FGF19 gene deletion gene mutation or gene amplification.

Additionally one can examine the methylation status of the FGF 19 gene in a tissue or cell sample. Aberrant demethylation and or hypermethylation of CpG islands in gene 5 regulatory regions frequently occurs in immortalized and transformed cells and can result in altered expression of various genes. A variety of assays for examining methylation status of a gene are well known in the art. For example one can utilize in Southern hybridization approaches methylation sensitive restriction enzymes which cannot cleave sequences that contain methylated CpG sites to assess the methylation status of CpG islands. In addition MSP methylation specific PCR can rapidly profile the methylation status of all the CpG sites present in a CpG island of a given gene. This procedure involves initial modification of DNA by sodium bisulfite which will convert all unmethylated cytosines to uracil followed by amplification using primers specific for methylated versus unmethylated DNA. Protocols involving methylation interference can also be found for example in Current Protocols In Molecular Biology Unit 12 Frederick M. Ausubel et al. eds. 1995 De Marzo et al. Am. J. Pathol. 155 6 1985 1992 1999 Brooks et al Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 1998 7 531 536 and Lethe et al. Int. J. Cancer 76 6 903 908 1998 . As used herein detecting FGF19 expression encompasses detection of FGF19 gene methylation.

Residue numbers are according to Kabat Kabat et al. Sequences of proteins of immunological interest 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 .

The phagemid used for this work is a monovalent Fab g3 display vector and consists of 2 open reading frames under control of a single phoA promoter. The first open reading frame consists of the stII signal sequence fused to the VL and CH1 domains of the acceptor light chain and the second consists of the stII signal sequence fused to the VH and CH1 domains of the acceptor heavy chain followed by the minor phage coat protein P3.

To make the HVR grafts hypervariable regions from murine 1A6 antibody mu1A6 see co owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 673 411 filed Feb. 9 2007 were grafted into the huKI and huIII consensus acceptor frameworks to generate the direct HVR graft of 1A6 1A6 graft . In the VL domain the following regions were grafted to the human consensus acceptor positions 24 34 L1 50 56 L2 and 89 97 L3 . In the VH domain positions 26 35 H1 49 65 H2 and 93 102 H3 were grafted. MacCallum et al. MacCallum et al. 262 732 745 1996 have analyzed antibody and antigen complex crystal structures and found positions 49 93 and 94 of the heavy chain are part of the contact region thus it seems reasonable to include these positions in the definition of HVR H2 and HVR H3 when humanizing antibodies. Correct clones were assessed by DNA sequencing.

For affinity maturation phage libraries based upon the HVR graft were generated that had mutations introduced in to the HVR loops e.g. as described in Dennis WO2005080432.

High affinity clones were identified through five rounds of panning against human FGF19 protein with progressively increased stringency. Briefly for the first 2 rounds of selection FGF19 was immobilized directly on MaxiSorp microtiter plates Nunc at 2 g ml in PBS. Successive rounds of selection used biotinylated FGF19 b FGF19 in a soluble selection method see e.g. Fuh et al. J. Mol. Biol. 2004 . FGF19 was biotinylated b FGF 19 using Sulfo NHS LC biotin Pierce . A short binding period and low concentrations of b FGF19 were utilized to enable selection of clones possessing faster association rates.

To express Fab protein for affinity measurements a stop codon was introduced between the heavy chain and g3 in the phage display vector. Clones were transformed into 34B8 cells and grown in Complete C.R.A.P. media at 30 C. Presta et al. 57 4593 4599 1997 . Cells were harvested by centrifugation suspended in PBS 100 uM PMSF 100 uM benzamidine 2.5 mM EDTA and broken open using a microfluidizer. Fab was purified with Protein G affinity chromatography.

For screening purposes IgG variants were initially produced in 293 cells. Vectors coding for VL and VH 25 g were transfected into 293 cells using the FuGene system. 500 uL of FuGENE was mixed with 4.5 mL of DMEM media containing no FBS. This was incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. The 25 g of each chain is added to this mixture and incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes. 1 mL of mixture was pipetted into each flask for transfection overnight at 37 C in 5 CO2. The following day the media containing the transfection mixture was removed and replaced with 23 mL PS04 media with 0.1 mL L of trace elements A0934 and 10 mg L of insulin A0940 . Cells were returned to the 37 C 5 CO2 incubator for an additional 5 days after which the media was harvested. The media was spun at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes and then sterile filtered using a 0.22 m low protein binding filter. 2.5 mL of 0.1 M PMSF was added for every 125 mL of media as a protease inhibitor and then stored at 4 C.

Affinity determinations were performed by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore 2000. Two protocols were used. Purified 1A6 variant IgG was immobilized directly approximately 550 RU in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.8 on a CM5 sensor chip and serial 2 fold dilutions of the FGF19 0.08 1250 nM in PBST were injected at a flow rate of 30 l min. Each sample was analyzed with 4 minute association and 10 minute dissociation. After each injection the chip was regenerated using 10 mM Glycine pH 1.7. Binding response was corrected by subtracting the RU from a flow cell with an irrelevant IgG immobilized at similar density. A 1 1 Languir model of simultaneous fitting of kand kwas used for kinetics analysis.

Unpurified 1A6 variant IgG was also assayed from culture supernatants using an anti human IgG capture method on the BIAcore 2000. Approximately 2700 RU of rabbit anti human IgG Pierce 31143 was immobilized in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.0 on a CM5 sensor chip. The concentration of unpurified 1A6 variant IgG was normalized to capture approximately 200 RU of IgG from 5 L of supernatant an irrelevant IgG was captured on a control flow cell. FGF19 a 2 fold serial dilution 0.08 to 1000 nM in PBST was injected at a flow rate of 30 L min. Each sample was analyzed with 4 minute association and 10 minute disassociation. After each injection the chip was regenerated using 10 mM Glycine pH 1.7. The immobilized anti human IgG was then recharged with culture supernatant containing unpurified 1A6 variant IgG for the next dilution of FGF19. Binding response was corrected by subtracting the irrelevant IgG flow cell control from 1A6 variant IgG flow cells. A 1 1 Languir model of simultaneous fitting of kand kwas used for kinetics analysis.

Maxisorb 96 well plates were coated overnight at 4 C. with 50 l of 2 g ml anti human immunoglobulin Fc fragment specific Jackson Immunoresearch and used to capture 1 g ml FGFR Fc chimeric proteins R D Systems . The non specific binding sites were saturated with PBS 3 BSA for 1 hour and FGF19 0.25 g ml was incubated for 2 h in PBS 0.3 BSA in the presence of oligosaccharides 0.5 g ml Neoparin Inc. and the indicated anti FGF19 antibody 0 10 g ml . FGF19 binding was detected using a biotinylated FGF19 specific polyclonal antibody 0.5 g ml BAF969 R D Systems followed by streptavidin HRP and TMB colorimetric substrate.

HEPG2 cells starved overnight in serum free media were treated with 250 ng ml FGF19 for 10 min in the presence or the absence of antibodies. Cells were lysed in R27A buffer Upstate with 10 mM NaF 1 mM sodium orthovanadate and complete protease inhibitor tablet Roche . Lysates were prepared electrophoresed and analyzed by Immunoblot using anti phospho MAPK and anti MAPK specific antibodies Cell Signaling . For immunoprecipitation of FGFR4 equal amounts of proteins were incubated with 1 g specific anti FGFR4 1G7 Genentech Inc. antibody immobilized onto protein A Sepharose for 2 h at 4 C. then washed with lysis buffer and eluted with 2 Laemmli buffer boiled and microcentrifuged. Immunoblotting was performed with anti phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 UpState anti phospho ERK2 antibody Santa Cruz Biotech . Membranes were stripped Pierce and reprobed with appropriate antibodies to determine total proteins.

Liver tissues were homogenized in modified RIPA buffer 50 mM Tris Cl pH 7.5 150 mM NaCl 1 IGEPAL 1 mM EDTA 0.25 sodium deoxycholate 1 mM NaF 1 mM Na3VO4 protease inhibitors cocktail Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. and clarified by centrifugation. Protein concentrations of the lysates were determined using the BCA protein assay reagent Pierce Rockford Ill. . Equal amounts of proteins were incubated with specific antibody immobilized onto protein A Sepharose Sigma Aldrich for 2 hours at 4 C. with gentle rotation. Beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer and immunecomplexes were eluted in 2 Laemmli buffer boiled and microcentrifuged. Proteins were resolved on SDS PAGE transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with specific primary antibodies. After washing and incubating with secondary antibodies immunoreactive proteins were visualized by the ECL detection system Amersham Arlington Ht. IL . Recombinant human and cynomolgus proteins were loaded at a concentration of 100 ng or 200 ng.

Six to eight week old athymic BALB c female mice Charles Rivers Inc. were inoculated subcutaneously with 5 10HCT116 colon tumor 200 l mouse . After 7 days mice bearing tumors of equivalent volumes 100 mm were randomized into groups n 10 and treated intraperitoneally once weekly. Tumors were measured with an electronic caliper Fowler Sylvac Ultra Cal Mark III and average tumor volume was calculated using the formula W2 L 2 W the smaller diameter L the larger diameter .

Tumors excised from treated animals were homogenized in lysis buffer 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 150 mM NaCl 1 NP 40 1 mM EDTA 0.25 sodium deoxycholate 1 mM NaF 1 mM sodium orthovanadate and complete protease inhibitor Roche . Equal amounts of proteins were incubated with 1 g specific FGFR4 1G7 Genentech Inc. or FRS2 UpState antibody immobilized onto protein A Sepharose for 2 h at 4 C. then washed with lysis buffer and eluted with 2 Laemmli buffer boiled and microcentrifuged. Immunoblots were done with anti phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 UpState anti phospho ERK2 antibody Santa Cruz Biotech or anti N terminally dephosphorylated catenin antibody UpState . Membranes were stripped Pierce and reprobed with appropriate antibodies to determine total proteins.

The human acceptor framework used for humanization of 1A6 consists of the consensus human kappa I VL domain and the human subgroup III consensus VH domain. The VL and VH domains of mu1A6 were aligned with the human kappa I and subgroup III domains each HVR was identified and grafted into the human acceptor framework to generate a 1A6 HVR graft that could be displayed as an Fab on phage .

Phage expressing the 1A6 graft bound to immobilized huFGF19 however when 1A6 graft was expressed as an IgG Biacore analysis of its affinity for FGF19 revealed that binding affinity had been reduced by over 50 fold relative to the chimeric 1A6 antibody largely due to a reduction in the association rate K Table 2 .

Phage libraries based upon the 1A6 HVR graft were generated that had mutations introduced in to the HVR loops. These libraries were panned for 2 rounds against immobilized FGF19 followed by 3 additional rounds of selection using short durations for binding to low concentrations of soluble b FGF19. Enrichment defined as the number of phage recovered in the presence of b FGF divided by the number of phage recovered in the absence of b FGF was observed beginning after round 3. Following 5 rounds of selection clones were picked for DNA sequence analysis. Sequence changes targeting each of the HVRs were observed .

Selected clones were reformatted as IgG for further analysis by Biacore. Several clones had improved affinities compared to the 1A6 graft antibody Table 3 . These clones had changes in the light chain variable region S34T S34A or Q90S or in the heavy chain variable region V34A H35Q V50L A100bR or A100bP M100cS .

The best clones had 1 change from 1A6 graft either S34A or S34G and showed similar binding affinity to the murine 1A6 antibody for human FGF19.

To avoid potential manufacturing issues a potential iso aspartic acid forming site Asp Gly in HVR L2 of the humanized 1A6 variants was eliminated by converting D56 either to Glu D56E or Ser D56S . Neither substitution had an effect on binding FGF19 as determined by Biacore. Tables 4 and 5 show the Biacore analysis of the D56S substituted antibodies.

Thus starting from a graft of the 6 murine 1A6 HVRs the expansion of HVR H2 to include position 49 Glycine the expansion of HCR H3 to include positions 93 Valine and 94 Arginine the addition of 1 change in HVR L1 leads to a fully humanized high affinity 1A6 antibody with a binding affinity for human FGF19 that is similar to that of the parent murine 1A6 antibody. Other humanized 1A6 variants have also been identified that are potentially therapeutically suitable. Furthermore selected humanized antibodies described herein have been determined to have at least comparable biological activity as the parent 1A6 antibody for example in receptor phosphorylation assays etc.

Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding the descriptions and examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.
