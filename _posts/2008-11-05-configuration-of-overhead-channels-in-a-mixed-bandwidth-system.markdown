title: Configuration of overhead channels in a mixed bandwidth system
abstract: A method and apparatus for transmitting broadcast information in a multi-carrier communication system. The Sync Channel of the multi-carrier system is transmitted a 1.25 MHz channel bandwidth (i.e., over a single carrier), and to specify the preferred channels for the Sync Channel transmission instead of the preferred channels for the entire multi-carrier system. The Sync Channel Message will carry additional information indicating the center frequency of a multi-carrier system within a reserved set of frequency bands and indicating the frequency of a single carrier system in the reserved set of frequency bands. Considering the A block of the PCS band again, the preferred channels for Sync Channel transmission can be selected as channels 75, 150 and 225. This selection ensures that one of the preferred channels will always be used by any multi-carrier system regardless of the location of its center channel.

The present invention relates to communications. More particularly the present invention relates to a novel and improved method and apparatus for transmitting and receiving broadcast information in a multi carrier CDMA communication system.

The use of code division multiple access CDMA modulation techniques is one of several techniques for facilitating communications in which a large number of system users are present. Other multiple access communication system techniques such as time division multiple access TDMA and frequency division multiple access FDMA are known in the art. However the spread spectrum modulation technique of CDMA has significant advantages over these modulation techniques for multiple access communication systems. The use of CDMA techniques in a multiple access communication system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 901 307 entitled SPREAD SPECTRUM MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING SATELLITE OR TERRESTRIAL REPEATERS assigned to the assignee of the present invention of which the disclosure thereof is incorporated by reference herein. The use of CDMA techniques in a multiple access communication system is further disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 103 459 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GENERATING SIGNAL WAVEFORMS IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM assigned to the assignee of the present invention of which the disclosure thereof is incorporated by reference herein. CDMA has been standardized by the Telecommunications Industry Association in Interim Standards IS 95A and IS 95B entitled Mobile Station Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual Mode Spread Spectrum Systems referred to hereafter collectively as IS 95 .

In IS 95 communications systems channels of information transmitted from a common base station are distinguished from one another by orthogonal spreading codes. Each channel is spread by a unique orthogonal spreading sequence. The channels that are transmitted by an IS 95 base station include a pilot channel a sync channel at least one paging channel and dedicated traffic channels. The pilot channel is used to provide a phase reference for coherent demodulation of the other channels by mobile stations within the coverage area of the base station. The sync channel carries overhead information such as timing information pilot PN offset information and other information that allows the reception of the other overhead channels. The paging channel notifies mobile stations of mobile terminated calls directed to the mobile station in the area. Dedicated traffic channels provide information directed to the user of a specific mobile station in the coverage area of the base station.

In IS 95 when the base station sends a Sync Channel Message it shall uses the fixed length message format of Table 1 below 

In IS 95 systems each base station transmits a pilot channel that is covered only by a short PN sequence. In IS 95 systems the short PN sequence repeats once every 26 ms. The pilot signal transmissions from each base station are distinguished from one another by a phase offset with respect to one another. In particular there each base station associated with a single base station controller differs in phase by at least 64 PN chips.

Under normal operation the mobile station acquires the pilot signal first. The pilot signal carries no data and is simply the all ones sequence spread by the common short code which also spreads all of the other channels transmitted by the base station. After acquiring the pilot channel the mobile station receives the information described above from the sync channel. The frame and interleaver timing on the sync channel are aligned with the pilot PN sequence. The zero state of the short PN sequence marks the starting point of the sync channel frame and interleaver.

In the U.S. Personal Communication System PCS spectrum the CDMA channel number N specifies the carrier frequencies of the forward and reverse link channels. In particular channel number N corresponds to a reverse link carrier frequency of 1850 0.05N MHz and a forward link carrier frequency of 1930 0.05N MHz where N ranges from 0 to 1199. The bandwidth of each CDMA channel is 1.25 MHz. Therefore the channel numbers of adjacent CDMA channels are different by at least 25 25 0.05 MHz 1.25 MHz . To facilitate mobile stations initial acquisition certain carrier frequencies are designated as the preferred frequency assignments. Referring to for an IS 95B CDMA system in the A block of PCS band the channel numbers of the preferred frequency assignments are 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200 225 250 and 275. Mobile stations will search the preferred frequency assignments first upon powering up.

The International Telecommunications Union recently requested the submission of proposed methods for providing high rate data and high quality speech services over wireless communication channels. A first of these proposals was issued by the Telecommunications Industry Association entitled The cdma2000 ITU R RTT Candidate Submission hereafter cdma2000 . cdma2000 proposes increasing the throughput of the forward link signals by transmitting portions of the information on three bands each of 1.2288 MHz. This method is described as the multi carrier approach.

A multi carrier CDMA system that uses three adjacent 1.25 MHz RF channels with channel spacing also equal to 1.25 MHz is defined in cdma2000. Referring to a multi carrier CDMA system in the A block of the PCS band can be deployed with the center channel on channel 50 75 100 125 150 175 200 225 or 250. Channels 50 and 250 are usually avoided to avoid interference to adjacent bands on the reverse link. In the proposed cdma2000 description the reverse link may be direct spread with a chip rate of 3.6864 Mcps which makes the emission limit requirements more difficult to meet than for a chip rate of 1.2288 Mcps.

A mobile station upon powering up searches for pilot signal on a preferred frequency. If no pilot is found in the current channel it changes its channel and searches again. Once a pilot is acquired the mobile station demodulates the Sync Channel associated with that pilot to receive timing information pilot PN offset and other information enabling its reception of the other overhead channels.

In a multi carrier approach one method for providing Sync Channel data would be to tri partition the Sync Channel message and place one third of the message on each of the three portions of the multi carrier signal. If the Sync Channel of a multi carrier system is spread over three channels the mobile station will have to know the exact channels used by the system in order to demodulate the Sync Channel reliably. Since the exact channels are not known in advance the mobile station has to try numerous combinations to receive the Sync Channel message. Given the number of preferred channels the time spent on such trials could be excessive and therefore degrade the mobile station s initial acquisition time. Therefore there is a need felt in the art for a method that minimizes the mobile station s search time.

The present invention is a novel and improved method and apparatus for transmitting broadcast information in a multi carrier communication system. The proposed invention is to send the Sync Channel of the multi carrier system in a 1.25 MHz channel bandwidth i.e. over a single carrier and to specify the preferred channels for the Sync Channel transmission instead of the preferred channels for the entire multi carrier system. The Sync Channel Message will indicate the center frequency for a multi carrier system in the band if one exists and the frequency of a single band system if one exists.

Considering the A block of the PCS band again the preferred channels for Sync Channel transmission can be selected as channels 75 150 and 225. This selection ensures that one of the preferred channels will always be used by any multi carrier system regardless the location of its center channel. The mobile station upon powering up searches on the preferred channels for Sync Channel first. Once the pilot signal is acquired on any of these channels the mobile station demodulates the Sync Channel on the channel as well. The mobile station learns from the Sync Channel Message the location of a multi carrier and a single carrier system in the band if either exists. It can be easily observed that the number of channels to search and the number of hypotheses to try are significantly reduced by using the proposal in this disclosure. As a result it improves the mobile station s initial acquisition time.

This method of receiving the Sync Channel message is very inefficient and time consuming. If a mobile station is capable of operating in a multi carrier or single carrier mode the mobile station will potentially have to conduct eleven 1 searches or bands and seven multi carrier searches using center frequencies . In a CDMA communication system each band searched requires the mobile station to test a large number of PN offsets to detect the presence of the pilot signal. Thus this method of acquisition requires a substantial time period.

The present invention provides a significantly more efficient method for acquiring the necessary system parameters in a potentially mixed bandwidth communication system. In the present invention the Sync Channel is always transmitted in a 1 band. In the preferred embodiment the preferred channels are channels 75 150 and 225. Thus a mobile station need only conduct at most three searches to receive the Synch Channel message in 1 bandwidth in order to acquire the necessary information for acquisition of its preferred system. The present invention greatly reduces acquisition time in a mixed bandwidth communication system. In addition by providing the Sync Channel message only on the preferred channels reduces the capacity impact of providing that overhead messaging on many more channels.

The reason for the allocation of the preferred channels of the present invention is that it provides the greatest flexibility in the provision of a multi carrier system. With the allocation of the preferred channels to channel numbers 75 150 and 220 and a multi carrier system provided anywhere in the band consisting of bands will include one of the preferred channels. A multi carrier system comprising the bands and will include the preferred channel . A multi carrier system comprising the bands and will include the preferred channel of . A multi carrier system comprising the bands of and will include the preferred channel of . A multi carrier system comprising the bands of and will include the preferred channel of . Any combinations of three adjacent bands will include a preferred channel upon which the mobile station will be able to receive the necessary system parameters for operation.

In the present invention the mobile station tunes to a preferred channel or and attempts to detect a pilot signal on that frequency band. If a pilot signal is detected the mobile station receives demodulates and decodes the Sync Channel message. In the present invention the Sync Channel message will provide information that identifies the center frequency of a multi carrier system in the current set of frequency bands if one exists and the frequency of a 1 band in the current set of frequency bands if one exists .

The mobile station in response to the information received in the Sync Channel selects the system that is appropriate for its needs or capabilities. If the mobile station prefers to use a multi carrier system the mobile station uses the center frequency of the multi carrier system indicated in the Sync Channel message to tune to the multi carrier system and receive the broadcast channel BCH message. The broadcast channel message will indicate to the mobile station the number of common control channels CCCHs that are employed by the current system. The mobile station takes the number of common control channels and using a predetermined hashing algorithm determines what code channel it will use to receive page messages from the transmitting base station.

If the mobile station selects to operate in a single band system the mobile station uses the information received in the Sync Channel message to tune to the appropriate frequency of the single band system. The mobile station then receives the general paging channel message on the primary paging channel. The general paging channel message provides the number of paging channels used by the single band system. The mobile station uses a predetermined hashing function to determine the code channel upon which the mobile station will receive paging messages for the transmitting base station.

The present invention is equally applicable to systems that may include 3 direct spread communications systems. In this embodiment the Sync Channel message would include the additional information whether the 3 system is a direct spread system or a multi carrier system. In addition the Sync Channel message may also provide information respecting whether the system uses a form of diversity transmission such as orthogonal transmit diversity OTD . If methods of transmission diversity are possible in the multiple bandwidth communication system specification of the means of transmit diversity greatly reduces the number of hypotheses that must be tested to acquire a system.

These changes to the Sync Channel messages can be accommodated without necessitating the extension of the Sync Channel message used in IS 95B and illustrated above. In the current Sync Channel message there a large number of reserved bits that can be used to provide the additional information.

In block the mobile station determines whether the search operation was successful. In the exemplary embodiment the present invention is incorporated into a CDMA communications system though the present invention would be equally applicable to other mixed bandwidth communications systems. In the exemplary embodiment the mobile station tunes its RF receiver to a preferred channel or and attempts to detect the presence of a pilot signal. In the exemplary embodiment of an IS 95 based CDMA communications system each base station transmits its pilot signal using a unique pilot signal offset. Thus the mobile station after tuning to a preferred channel or searches the possible PN offset hypotheses.

The method and apparatus for detecting a pilot signal in a CDMA communication system are well known in the art and are described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5 644 591 entitled Method And Apparatus For Performing Search Acquisition In A CDMA Communication System which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein. The mobile station tests each PN offset hypothesis by computing the correlation between the received signal within the preferred frequency band with the PN hypothesis being tested. If the correlation energy for all PN hypotheses is less than a threshold value then the acquisition at the preferred frequency is not successful and the operation moves to block . In block the next preferred channel or to be tested by the mobile station is selected and the flow moves to block and continues as described.

When the mobile station detects sufficient correlation energy between the received signal at the preferred channel frequency and a PN offset hypothesis a successful acquisition is declared. At this point the operation moves to block . In block the mobile station receives the Sync Channel message. In the present invention the Sync Channel message is transmitted in a single 1 band or . In the exemplary embodiment of an IS 95 based CDMA communication system the Sync Channel frame boundary and the interleaver boundary are aligned with the short PN sequence used to spread the pilot channel signal. Thus upon successful acquisition of the pilot channel signal the mobile station has enough information to de interleave and decode the Sync Channel message.

After receiving the Sync Channel message the operation moves to block . The mobile station determines from the Sync Channel message the center frequency of a multi carrier system in the current set of bands if one exists and the location of a single carrier band in the current set of bands if one exists . The mobile station decides whether to operate in a multi carrier mode or a single channel mode based on its capabilities and needs.

The operation moves to control block . If the mobile station capable of operating in a multi carrier mode decides to operate in multi carrier mode then the flow moves to block . In block the mobile station initiates its RF hardware for multi carrier reception. The mobile station will know from the received Sync Channel message the center frequency of a multi carrier system in the current set of frequency bands if one exists. The operation then moves to block where the mobile station receives the broadcast channel BCH signal and from that channel learn among other information the number of common control channels used by the communication system. The mobile station hashes the number of common control channels to determine the code channel that it should use to receive pages.

If back in block the mobile station decides to use a single channel system because of limitations in its capability or other preference with respect to its service needs the operation moves to block . In block the mobile station initiates its RF hardware for single carrier reception. The operation then moves to block where the mobile station receives the general page message on a predetermined code channel. The general page message will state the number of paging channels used by the system. The mobile station hashes the number of paging channels used to determine the code channel that it will use to receive directed pages from the serving base station.

The data for transmission on forward link signal is provided to de multiplexer . De multiplexer provides the data to one of the three transmission subsystems . The present invention is described in terms of a three carrier multi carrier communication system because three IS 95 carriers each occupying 1.2288 MHz can fit into a 5 MHz band. However it will be understood by one skilled in the art that the teachings of the present invention can easily be extended to an arbitrary number of channels in a multi carrier system.

Turning to a simplified multi carrier receiver which in the exemplary embodiment is provided in mobile station is illustrated. In the exemplary embodiment mobile station is capable of simultaneously receiving forward link signals transmitted on up to three carrier channels. It will be understood by one skilled in the art that the present invention can be extended to multi carrier reception of an arbitrary number of channels. The received signal is provided to each of receive subsystems which down convert and demodulate a different component of forward link signal in accordance with a unique carrier frequency.

The forward link signal is received at antenna and provided to receivers . Each of receivers and down convert filter and amplify the received signal in accordance with a different frequency f f or f respectively. The down converted signals are provided to demodulators . In the exemplary embodiment demodulators demodulate each of the down converted signals in accordance with a code division multiple access CDMA modulation format. The implementation of demodulators is described in detail in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 5 103 459. The demodulated components of forward link signal are provided to multiplexer MUX which re assembles the transmitted data stream.

In the present invention mobile station initially only uses a single receiver and demodulator to demodulate the Sync Channel. Mobile station tunes a selected receivers to a preferred channel or and attempts to acquire the pilot signal at the preferred channel frequency using a corresponding one of demodulators . If sufficient correlation energy is detected the acquisition is declared to be successful. The mobile station then still only down converting at the single frequency demodulates de interleaves and decodes the Sync Channel message. From the Sync Channel message mobile station determines the center frequency of a multi carrier system in the current frequency bands if one exists and the frequency of a single carrier system in the current frequency bands if one exists.

Mobile station decides whether it will operate in a multi carrier mode or a single carrier mode. If mobile station decides to operate in a multi carrier mode then mobile station activates the RF circuitry additional receivers tuning to the appropriate set of frequencies indicated in the Sync Channel message and begins to receive the forward link signal on a plurality of carrier frequencies. If mobile station decides to operate in a single carrier mode then mobile station tunes to the appropriate frequency indicated in the Sync Channel message and begins to receive the forward link signal on a single carrier frequency band.

The forward link signals are received at antenna and provided to receiver . Receiver tunes to a preferred channel frequency and down converts filters and amplifies the received signal.

The resultant signals from pilot filter are provided to energy detector which sums the squares of the resultant samples from pilot filter to provide a received pilot energy value. The received pilot energy value is provided to control processor where it is compared to a predetermined threshold value.

If the energy falls below the threshold value then the acquisition is declared unsuccessful and the next PN hypothesis is provided by control processor to complex PN despreader . The method and apparatus for searching PN offsets in a CDMA communication system is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5 644 591 entitled Method And Apparatus For Performing Search Acquisition In A CDMA Communication System which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein. If after exhausting the possible PN offset hypotheses the received pilot energy fails to exceed the threshold value then control processor sends message to receiver to begin down converting the received signal at a different preferred frequency channel.

Upon successful acquisition of a pilot channel on a preferred channel frequency mobile station demodulates and decodes the Sync Channel message. The received signal from receiver is despread using the PN offset determined in the pilot search algorithm. The pilot signal is processed by pilot filter as described above.

The PN despread signal is also provided to Walsh despreader . Walsh despreader despreads the received signal in accordance with a Walsh code sequence Wchan. When demodulating the Sync Channel the Wchan is Walsh sequence allocated for the transmission of the Sync Channel message.

As forward link signal traverses the propagation path to mobile station an unknown phase component is introduced into the received signal. Dot product circuit computes the projection of the received signal onto the received pilot signal to provide a scalar result without the phase errors. The implementation of dot product circuits for coherent demodulation are well known in the art and a method and apparatus for performing the dot product procedure is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5 506 865 entitled Pilot Carrier Dot Product Circuit which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention and is incorporated by reference herein.

The scalar outputs from dot product circuit are provided to multiplexer which combine the two received streams into a signal data stream. The data stream from multiplexer is provided to de interleaver which reorders the received symbols in accordance with a predetermined de interleaving format. The reordered symbols are provided to decoder which decodes the symbols of the Sync Channel message to provide the received Sync Channel message.

The received Sync Channel message is provided to control processor . In the present invention control processor determines from the Sync Channel message the channel frequency for the primary overhead channel of the single carrier system or the center frequency of the multi carrier system. In response to the Sync Channel message control processor initiates the correct number of receive subsystems and tunes them to the appropriate channels to receive forward link signal .
