The present invention relates to the residual life of filters and in particular to residual life indicators for filters.

Air purification systems typically provide a purified air stream to the interiors of enclosures such as buildings vehicles mobile or stationary shelters etc. These air purification systems typically use filters such as adsorptive filters e.g. carbon filters to filter e.g. adsorb gaseous or vaporous contaminants such as toxic gasses or vapors e.g. gaseous or vaporous chemical and or biological warfare agents from an air stream to provide a purified air stream to the enclosure. One problem with some filters is that it is often hard to determine the remaining filtering capacity of the filter often termed the residual life of the filter such as the remaining adsorption capacity of the filter and thus whether the filter is still capable of filtering gaseous or vaporous contaminants from an air stream.

A residual life indicator for determining the residual life of a filter has a first sample filter with an inlet coupleable to an inlet of the filter whose residual life is to be determined a second sample filter having an inlet coupleable to an outlet of the filter whose residual life is to be determined a chemical tracer source selectively coupled to the inlets of the first and second sample filters and a detector selectively coupled to outlets of the first and second filters.

In the following detailed description reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. In the drawings like numerals describe substantially similar components throughout the several views. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice these embodiments. Other embodiments may be utilized and structural logical and electrical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.

The residual life may be defined as the remaining filtering capacity of a filter such as filter . Filter may be an adsorptive type filter that has an adsorptive bed having a bed depth d. For example the adsorptive bed may a carbon bed e.g. an ASZM TEDA carbon bed. For an adsorptive type filter the residual life may be defined as the remaining adsorptive capacity of the filter. During operation filter removes gaseous or vaporous contaminants such as toxic gasses or vapors from the contaminated inlet air stream received at its inlet and outputs a purified air stream at its outlet. For example filter may adsorb the gaseous or vaporous contaminants from the contaminated air stream.

Residual life indicator includes sample filters and that are respectively coupled to the contaminated inlet stream and the purified outlet stream. For example a tee may couple tee and thus the contaminated inlet air stream at the inlet of filter to an inlet of sample filter and a tee may couple tee and thus the purified air stream exiting filter at the outlet of filter to an inlet of sample filter as shown in .

For one embodiment sample filters and are substantially identical to each other. For example sample filters and may respectively include substantially identical adsorptive beds and e.g. of carbon such as ASZM TEDA carbon. For another embodiment adsorptive beds and may have substantially the same bed depth d. For another embodiment each of adsorptive beds and may have substantially the same bed depth as adsorptive bed of filter . For example each of adsorptive beds and may have the bed depth d e.g. that could be about 5.7 cm for some embodiments.

Residual life indicator also includes a chemical tracer source . Chemical tracer source may be selectively coupled to tee and thus to the inlet of sample filter and to tee and thus to the inlet of sample filter by a three way valve for example as shown in . For example in a first state three way valve directs chemical tracer from chemical tracer source to the inlet of sample filter via tee and in a second state three way valve directs chemical tracer from chemical tracer source to the inlet of sample filter via tee . In a third state three way valve prevents the chemical tracer from flowing. For one embodiment three way valve may be electrically coupled to a controller that may be an integral part of residual life indicator or that may be a personal computer that is separate from residual life indicator . During operation three way valve may be selectively activated in response to receiving electrical signals from controller between its first second and third states.

For another embodiment a flow rate controller such as a mass or volume flow rate controller is coupled between an outlet chemical tracer source and three way valve and thus is selectively coupled to the inlets of sample filters and by three way valve . Flow rate controller controls the flow rate of chemical tracer from chemical tracer source to the inlet of sample filter when three way valve is in the first state. Flow rate controller controls the flow rate of chemical tracer from chemical tracer source to the inlet of sample filter when three way valve is in the second state. For example flow rate controller is used to control the flow rate of a pulse of chemical tracer delivered to the inlet of sample filter or sample filter by three way valve during a certain time interval which may be referred to as the pulse duration during which three way valve is in either the first or second state. For one embodiment the amount e.g. the mass of chemical tracer delivered to the inlet of sample filter and sample filter is substantially the same.

For one embodiment flow rate controller may be coupled to controller for receiving electrical signals from controller that can be used to set the flow rate output by flow rate controller . Note that the controller can control the pulse duration for sample filter by controlling the time during which three way valve is in the first state and the pulse duration for sample filter by controlling the time during which three way valve is in the second state.

Chemical tracer source may include a container containing a pressurized chemical tracer gas having a certain e.g. desired concentration. Alternatively a pressurized chemical tracer gas may be subsequently mixed with an air or an inert gas stream to a certain e.g. desired concentration for selective delivery to the inlets of sample filters and . For another embodiment chemical tracer source may include a container that contains the chemical tracer as a pressurized liquid that is converted into a gaseous chemical tracer upon release from the container. The converted gaseous chemical tracer may then be mixed with an air or an inert gas stream to a certain e.g. desired concentration for selective delivery to the inlets of sample filters and .

For another embodiment chemical tracer source may include an adsorbent tube filled with adsorbed chemical tracer that may be heated or pressurized such that a certain e.g. desired concentration of tracer is desorbed from the tube for selective output from chemical tracer source to the inlets of sample filters and . For another embodiment chemical tracer source may include a spray nozzle that delivers liquid droplets of chemical tracer to an air or an inert gas stream where the droplets evaporate to produce a gaseous chemical tracer with a certain e.g. desired concentration that is subsequently selectively delivered to the inlets of sample filters and . For another embodiment chemical tracer source may include a saturator cell where either an air or an inert gas stream may be bubbled through a container or packed column filled with the chemical tracer at a predetermined rate.

Non limiting examples of suitable chemical tracer may include acetone ammonia alcohols amines a variety of water soluble and or polar chemicals and or any chemical or mixture whose flow through sample filters and may be delayed or held up by sample filters and at a full range of relative humidity conditions and water loadings such as to provide discrimination between mechanical leaks e.g. due to gasketing settling etc. premature breakthrough and the remaining life of sample filters and and thus filter . The chemical tracer and thus the chemical tracer pulse produced thereby may include a single chemical or a mixture of chemicals e.g. binary mixtures tertiary mixtures etc. .

The outlets of sample filters and may be respectively coupled to tees and as shown in . Tees and and thus the respective outlets of sample filters and may be coupled to flow rate controllers and e.g. volume or mass flow rate controllers. Flow rate controller controls the flow rate of the portion of contaminated air that is drawn through sample filter from the contaminated inlet air stream that enters filter and flow rate controller controls the flow rate of the portion of purified air that is drawn through sample filter from the purified air stream that exits filter . For one embodiment the flow rates through sample filters and may be selected so that the flow velocities through sample filters and are substantially the same as each other. For another embodiment the flow rates through sample filters and may be selected so that the flow velocities through sample filters and are each substantially the same as the flow velocity through filter . For one embodiment flow rate controllers and may be coupled to controller for receiving electrical signals from controller that can be used to set the flow rate outputs of flow rate controllers and .

The outlets of flow rate controllers and are coupled to a tee as shown in . The outlet of tee is coupled to a suction device such as a vacuum pump or a blower operating in a suction mode that draws the respective flows through sample filters and and flow rate controllers and and delivers the respective flows to the purified air stream exiting filter via a tee . For one embodiment the outlet of vacuum pump forms an outlet of residual life indicator .

Tees and and thus the respective outlets of sample filters and may also be selectively coupled to a detector by a three way valve for example. When three way valve is in a first state for example three way valve directs a portion of the flow exiting sample filter to detector via tee . When three way valve is in a second state for example three way valve directs a portion of the flow exiting sample filter to detector via tee . When three way valve is in a third state for example three way valve prevents flow from either sample filter or sample filter from flowing to detector and thus causes all of the flow exiting sample filters and to be respectively directed through flow rate controllers and .

For one embodiment three way valve may be electrically coupled to controller . During operation three way valve may be selectively activated in response to receiving electrical signals from controller between its first second and third states.

For one embodiment detector may be configured to output electrical signals indicative of chemical concentrations to controller . Non limiting examples of suitable detectors may include Photo Ionization Detectors PIDs Flame Ionization Detectors FIDS infrared detectors etc. For one embodiment controller analyzes the data from detector and may include algorithms for determining the residual life of sample filter and thus filter .

A flow rate controller such as a mass or volume flow rate controller is coupled between the exit of detector and tee where tee couples the outlet of flow rate controller and thus the outlet of detector to vacuum pump . Flow rate controller controls the flow rate through detector and thus the flow rate from sample filter through three way valve when three way valve is in the first state or the flow rate from sample filter through three way valve when three way valve is in the second state.

Residual life indicator can operate in three different operating modes. For example placing three way valves and into their third states places residual life indicator in a first operating mode placing three way valves and into their first states places residual life indicator in a second operating mode and placing three way valves and into their second states places residual life indicator in a second operating mode.

When residual life indicator is in its first operating mode with the three way valves and in their third states vacuum pump draws a portion of the contaminated air stream being received at the inlet of filter before it enters filter through filter which filters the contaminated air and through flow rate controller which sets the flow rate through filter at a certain flow rate e.g. such that the flow velocity through filter is substantially the same as the flow velocity through filter . Therefore the flow at the inlets of filter and sample filter have substantially the same level of contamination and substantially the same relative humidity.

Sample filter is configured to operate in the same manner as filter such that their outputs have substantially the same relative humidity and same degree of purification. For example sample filter and filter may have the same adsorptive bed material e.g. ASZM TEDA carbon the same bed depths d and the same flow velocities. Therefore sample filter is configured to mimic filter and at any given time sample filter will have substantially the same residual life as filter . Therefore the residual life of filter can be determined from a determination of the residual life of sample filter .

When residual life indicator is in its first operating mode vacuum pump also draws a portion of the purified air stream exiting filter through filter and through flow rate controller which sets the flow rate through filter at a certain flow rate e.g. such that the flow velocity through filter is substantially the same as the flow velocity through filter and substantially the same as the flow velocity through sample filter . Therefore the flow at the exit of filter and the inlet sample filter have substantially the same level of contamination or purification and relative humidity.

Sample filter is configured to operate in the same manner as filter and sample filter . For example sample filter sample filter and filter may have the same adsorptive bed material e.g. ASZM TEDA carbon the same bed depths d and the same flow velocities. However since sample filter is receiving purified air from filter filter retains its initial residual life e.g. it has substantially the same residual life as filter and sample filter when filter and sample filter are first activated or put into service. Therefore filter acts as a reference filter that provides a baseline to which sample filter is compared.

Note that the flows at the inlets of filter and sample filters and will have substantially the same relative humidity so that filter and sample filters and have substantially the same water loading. Therefore any comparisons between sample filters and account for the effect of relative humidity or water loading thereby eliminating the need to separately measure and separately correct for relative humidity effects.

When residual life indicator is in its second operating mode with three way valves and in their first states vacuum pump still draws a portion of the contaminated air stream before it enters filter through sample filters and and respectively through flow rate controllers and . In addition a portion of the flow exiting sample filter is now directed through detector via three way valve and through flow rate controller which sets the flow rate through detector . Chemical tracer is added from chemical tracer source via three way valve and tee to the contaminated air flow before the contaminated air flow enters sample filter . The amount of chemical tracer added to filter is established by the flow rate of the chemical tracer which is set by flow rate controller and the length of time during which the chemical tracer flows which corresponds to the time that three way valve is in its first state.

The passage of the chemical tracer through sample filter is delayed or held up e.g. retained by sample filter e.g. by adsorptive bed so that there is not immediate break through of chemical tracer from filter . For one embodiment the chemical tracer is selected so that although the chemical tracer is delayed by filter substantially all of the chemical tracer exits e.g. elutes from filter . In view of the fact that the relative humidity in terms of the water vapor adsorbed by the filter affects the length of time the chemical tracer is delayed by filter the chemical tracer is further selected so that the effects of the water vapor adsorbed by filter is such that the chemical tracer is sufficiently delayed by the filter so that there is not immediate break through of the chemical tracer from filter .

Three way valve in its first state directs a portion of the flow containing the chemical tracer exiting sample filter through detector . Detector detects the concentration of the chemical tracer in the flow and outputs a signal to controller indicative of the detected concentration. For one embodiment detector may be triggered to detect at substantially the same instant three way valves and are placed into their first states and the chemical tracer starts flowing through three way valve and tee into the flow at the inlet of sample filter .

When residual life indicator is in its third operating mode with three way valves and in their second states vacuum pump still draws a portion of the contaminated air stream before it enters filter through sample filters and and respectively through flow rate controllers and . In addition a portion of the flow exiting sample filter is now directed through detector via three way valve and through flow rate controller . Chemical tracer is added from chemical tracer source via three way valve and tee to the purified air flow from filter before the purified air flow enters sample filter . The amount of chemical tracer added to filter is established by the flow rate of the chemical tracer which is set by flow rate controller and the length of time during which the chemical tracer flows which corresponds to the time that three way valve is in its second state.

The passage of the chemical tracer through sample filter is delayed or held up e.g. retained by sample filter e.g. by adsorptive bed so that there is not immediate break through of chemical tracer from filter . For one embodiment the chemical tracer is selected so that although the chemical tracer is delayed by filter substantially all of the chemical tracer exits e.g. elutes from filter . In view of the fact that sample filter is substantially identical to sample filter for some embodiments the effects of the water vapor adsorbed by filter is such that the chemical tracer is sufficiently delayed by the filter so that there is not immediate break through of the chemical tracer from filter .

Three way valve in its second state directs a portion of the flow containing the chemical tracer exiting sample filter through detector . Detector detects the concentration of the chemical tracer in the flow and outputs a signal to controller indicative of the detected concentration. For one embodiment detector may be triggered to detect at substantially the same instant three way valves and are placed into their second states and the chemical tracer starts flowing through three way valve and tee into the flow at the inlet of sample filter .

As indicated above sample filter is configured to mimic filter so that the residual life of filter can be determined from a determination of the residual life of sample filter . That is at any given time sample filter will have substantially the same residual life as filter . Moreover sample filter mimics sample filter and filter when filter and sample filter are first activated or put into service.

In the example of the contaminant contained in the contaminated air stream at the inlet to filter and the inlet to sample filter is octane and acetone is added to the inlet to sample filter as the chemical tracer. Curve is obtained for about 75 percent of adsorptive bed of sample filter contaminated with loading of about 0.1 gram octane gram of adsorptive bed material e.g. where the adsorptive bed material is carbon. Curve is obtained for about 25 percent of adsorptive bed of sample filter contaminated with a loading of about 0.1 gram octane gram of adsorptive bed material. Since the inlet of sample filter corresponds to the filtered output of filter the acetone is added to the purified air stream at the inlet to sample filter and adsorptive bed of sample filter is substantially free of contamination. Therefore curve corresponds to a reference curve to which curves and can be compared.

Note that curves and are for the same relative humidity and thus the same water loading and that the shapes of curves and may vary with different relative humidities. Note further that curves and may be obtained for known percentages of the filter contaminated with known contaminant loadings as part of a calibration of sample filter and thus residual life indicator . Alternatively field data or curves similar to curves and may be obtained for unknown percentages of filter contaminated with unknown contaminant loadings. These curves may then be used to determine the residual life of filter and thus filter during the actual operation of filter and residual life indicator using the calibration as is discussed below. For example curves and may represent calibration curves or field curves obtained during the actual operation of filter and residual life indicator . For one embodiment the concentration data of the output pulses of the chemical tracer such as the curves of may be stored as data files in controller .

After obtaining the concentration data corresponding to curves and the difference between the concentration data of curve and reference curve can be obtained and curve fitted and the difference between the concentration data of curve and reference curve can be obtained and curve fitted e.g. using controller . presents an example of difference curves e.g. using ammonia as the chemical tracer octane as the contaminant and carbon as the material of adsorptive bed of sample filter and of adsorptive bed of sample filter .

Difference curve is obtained by subtracting the concentration of the chemical tracer at the outlet of sample filter from itself and is thus coincident with the horizontal axis. The remaining curves are obtained by subtracting the concentration of the chemical tracer at the outlet of sample filter from the concentration of the chemical tracer at the outlet of sample filter . For example difference curves and are respectively obtained for about 25 percent 100 percent and 75 percent of adsorptive bed of sample filter contaminated with a loading of about 0.1 gram octane gram of adsorptive bed material and difference curves and are respectively obtained for about 25 percent 75 percent and 100 percent of adsorptive bed of sample filter contaminated with a loading of about 0.2 gram octane gram of adsorptive bed material as shown in .

Note that sample filter is substantially free from contaminants. Note further that sample filters and are operating at the same relative humidity and thus have substantially the same water loading. Therefore the difference curves in the example of present substantially only the effects of filter contamination and do not need to be corrected for relative humidity.

Note that the peak concentration difference increases as the percentage of the filter contaminated with a specific contaminant loading increases. The peak concentration difference also increases as the contaminant loading of a specific percentage of the filter increases. For one embodiment the peak concentration difference may be correlated to the residual life of sample filter and thus filter . For example the higher the peak concentration difference the lower the residual life. However the residual life cannot be obtained directly from difference curves such as those shown in .

Note that the difference curves of may be obtained for known percentages of sample filter contaminated with known contaminant loadings as part of a calibration of sample filter and thus residual life indicator . Alternatively field difference curves similar to those of may be obtained for unknown percentages of sample filter contaminated with unknown contaminant loadings for determining the residual life of filter and thus filter during the actual operation of filter and residual life indicator using the calibration as is discussed below. For one embodiment the difference data of difference curves such as the difference curves of may be stored as difference data files in controller .

For one embodiment a residual life may be determined for each of the difference curves of from a set of break through curves or break through data by passing a chemical simulant e.g. that simulates the contaminant in the contaminated air stream through sample filters and . provides an illustrative example of a set of break through curves for a simulant such as hexane but similar break through curves may be obtained for other simulants. Break through curve is a break through curve obtained from passing hexane through sample filter which is substantially free of contamination and thus corresponds to a fresh filter and sampling the output of sample filter using detector . Therefore break through curve can be thought of as a reference break through curve. Note for example break through curve may correspond to a difference curve similar to difference curve of .

Break through curves and are break through curves obtained from passing hexane through sample filter for different contamination levels of filter and sampling the output of sample filter using detector . For example break through curve may correspond to a difference curve similar to difference curve of and break through curve may correspond to a difference curve similar to difference curve of .

For one embodiment the residual life is obtained from the ratio of the time it takes e.g. starting from the time the simulant enters sample filter until a certain concentration of simulant is detected at the outlet of sample filter for a certain contamination level of sample filter to the time it takes e.g. starting from the time the stimulant enters sample filter until a certain concentration of simulant is detected at the outlet of sample filter the substantially uncontaminated reference. For example a concentration of 30 mg of simulant per cubic meter is detected at time tat the outlet of sample filter after the stimulant enters sample filter e.g. time zero in and can be read from break through curve . For the contamination level of sample filter at which break through curve is obtained a concentration of 30 mg of simulant per cubic meter is detected at time tat the outlet of sample filter after the stimulant enters sample filter e.g. time zero in and can be read from break through curve . For the contamination level of sample filter at which break through curve is obtained a concentration of 30 mg of simulant per cubic meter is detected at time tat the outlet of sample filter after the stimulant enters sample filter e.g. time zero in and can be read from break through curve .

The residual life of sample filter for the contamination level of break through curve is t t e.g. about 0.76 or 76 percent for this example . The residual life of sample filter for the contamination level of break through curve is t t e.g. about 0.24 or 24 percent for this example . Note that when sample filter is first installed its break through curve will be substantially the same as break through curve for sample filter and the residual life will be 1.0 or 100 percent. For one embodiment the data corresponding to each break through curve and the residual life corresponding to that break through curve may be stored in controller .

Note that sets of break through curves may be obtained at different relative humidities where the effect of the relative humidity either shifts the break through curves of to the left or right. However the time ratios and thus the residual life typically remain substantially unaffected by the changes in relative humidity.

For one embodiment a simulant e.g. octane may be passed through sample filter for the contamination levels that respectively resulted in difference curves and of to produce break through curves for sample filter for the contamination levels that respectively resulted in difference curves and . A reference break through curve may also be obtained for sample filter by passing the simulant therethrough. A residual life may then be obtained for each of the break through curves as described above in conjunction with and thus for respective ones of the difference curves thereby correlating the residual life obtained from the each break through curves to respective ones of the difference curves. That is each difference curve will be have a residual life associated therewith thereby defining a set of predetermined calibration difference curves or difference data . Note that a set of calibrated curves may be obtained for different simulants chemical tracers relative humidities flow velocities through the sample filters different concentrations of simulants different concentrations of chemical tracers etc.

To obtain a residual life using residual life indicator during the actual operation thereof a difference curve similar to those of is obtained as described above in conjunction with . For example a chemical tracer is passed through filters and and the concentration data versus time is obtained at the outlets of filters and using detector and is stored in controller . Controller may then use the data to form concentration curves similar to those of . Controller may then subtract the concentration data at the outlet of sample filter from the concentration data at the outlet of sample filter to form an actual difference curve similar to those of . Controller may then compare the actual difference data or curve to the calibration difference curves stored therein. Upon finding a calibration difference curve that is substantially similar to the actual difference curve controller may indicate that the residual life of filter and thus of filter is the residual life associated with the calibration difference curve.

For another embodiment controller may compare the peak concentration difference of the actual difference curve to a certain concentration differences such as the peak concentration differences of the calibrated difference curves. When the peak concentration difference of the actual difference curve is greater than or equal to a certain concentration difference e.g. the peak concentration difference of a calibrated difference curve associated with a certain residual life e.g. a residual life of about 25 percent or less controller may indicate that sample filter and thus filter has no remaining residual life.
