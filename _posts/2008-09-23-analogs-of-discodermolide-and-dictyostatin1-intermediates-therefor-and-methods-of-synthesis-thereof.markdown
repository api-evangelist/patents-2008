The discovery and development of new chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer is currently of high importance. Some of the best currently available chemotherapeutic agents are natural products or natural product analogs. For example Taxol paclitaxel is a natural product that is currently being used to treat patients with breast and ovarian cancer among others. A number of analogs of Taxol including Taxotere docetaxel are also powerful anticancer agents.

Recently the natural product discodermolide and its analogs have shown great promise as anticancer agents. Discodermolide has been shown to have a mechanism of action similar to Taxol but it is active against Taxol resistant cell lines and it is more water soluble than Taxol. Accordingly it may have a different and or broader spectrum of action than Taxol and be easier to formulate and administer. Like Taxol discodermolide is difficult to synthesize. Some syntheses of discodermolide are described in the following papers Nerenberg J. B. Hung D. T. Somers P. K. Schreiber S. L. Total synthesis of the immunosuppressive agent discodermolide. 1993 115 12621 12622 Smith A. B. III Qiu Y. Jones D. R. Kobayashi K. Total Synthesis of Discodermolide. 1995 117 12011 12012 Marshall J.

Analogs of discodermolide have also been made and tested for activity. For example see the above references and Paterson I. Florence G. J. Gerlach K. Scott J. P. Sereinig N.

Unlike Taxol discodermolide is not readily available in large quantities from natural sources. Accordingly assuring a sufficient supply of discodermolide is problematic. Simplified analogs that retain high anti cancer activity but are easier to make are in urgent need.

Very recently an unusual macrolactone natural product dictyostatin 1 has been isolated from two different sponges and a partial structure has been assigned as shown below. See Pettit G. R. Cichacz Z. A. Isolation and structure of dictyostatin 1. In U.S. Pat. No. 5 430 053 1995 Pettit G. R. Cichacz Z. A. Gao F. Boyd M. R. Schmidt J. M. Isolation and structure of the cancer cell growth inhibitor dictyostatin 11994 1111 1112. The configurations at C16 and C19 have not yet been assigned in the natural product and the absolute configuration is not known. Dictyostatin shows extremely high potencies against and array of cancer cell lines.

Recently dictyostatin has also been shown to stabilize microtubules like discodermolide and Taxol. See Wright A. E. Cummins J. L. Pomponi S. A. Longley R. E. Isbrucker R. A. Dictyostatin compounds for stabilization of microtubules. In PCT Int. Appl. WO62239 2001. Accordingly dictyostatin 1 and its analogs show great promise as new anticancer agents. There is an urgent need for a synthetic route to make dictyostatin 1 and its analogs in order to fully assign the structure of dictyostatin 1 to produce analogs to study the structure activity relationship and to identify and produce the best possible drugs in this family.

The present invention along with the attributes and attendant advantages thereof will best be appreciated and understood in view of the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Synthesis of Simplified Analogs of Discodermolide The inventors of the present invention hypothesized that active analogs of discodermolide would result after removal of the C14 and C16 methyl groups and the C7 hydroxy group. These deletions greatly simplify the synthesis by allowing the two cis disubstituted alkenes of analogs 1 and 2 to be made by Wittig type reactions. A family of simple analogs 1 were shown to have moderate activity. However by incorporating a lactone in place of the simple ester side chains of 1 the inventors of the present invention have discovered anti cancer agents of increased activity that are still significantly simpler to make than discodermolide.

The syntheses of two representative isomeric aldehydes 9a and 9b for incorporation of the left part of these molecules are shown in . he synthesis of the left display bearing the configuration of discodermolide started with the commercially available methacrolein 3 . Reaction of 3 with the boron enolate of Evans oxazolidinone 4 gave the corresponding alcohol which was silylated to give compound 5 in 90 yield. Lactonization followed by the introduction of allyl group was performed by the previously reported method to give 6 in good yield. See Day B. W. Kangani C. O. Avor K. S. Convenient syntheses of 2R 3S 4R 3 tert butyldimethylsilanyloxy 2 4 dimethyl 5 oxopentanoic acid methoxymethyl amide from methacrolein. Preparation of C1 C7 and C17 C24 fragments of discodermolide. 2002 13 1161 1165. Lactone opening oxidation and allylation gave 7. Conversion to the methyl acetal was accomplished by DIBAL diisobutylaluminum hydride reduction to the corresponding lactol followed by treatment with camphorsulfonic acid CSA in methanol to give a desilylated intermediate which was protected with methoxymethyl chloride MOMCl to give a mixture of anomers 8 1 1 . These were separable by silica gel flash chromatography. The final left fragment 9a was obtained by hydroboration of the anomer 8 with BH DMS borane dimethysulfide followed by oxidation with SO pyridine.

The synthesis of the C4 epi lactone left display 9b started from 1 4 butanediol . Monoprotection with PMB bromide PMB is p methoxybenzyl was performed with NaH in DMF. After oxidation reaction of the crude aldehyde 10 with the boron enolate of Evans oxazolidinone 4 gave the corresponding syn alcohol which was silylated to give compound II in 90 yield. Lithium borohydride reduction followed by oxidation gave the aldehyde 12. A second syn aldol addition was performed with same Evans oxazolidinone 4 to give the corresponding alcohol which was protected with MOM chloride to give compound 13. Desilylation of 13 with HF gave the cyclized product 14 in high yield. Conversion to the methyl acetal was easily accomplished by DIBAL reduction to the corresponding lactol followed by treatment with PPTS pyridinium p toluene sulfonate in methanol to give 15 as a 2.5 1 mixture of anomers from which the major anomer a was isolated by silica gel flash chromatography. The final left fragment 9b was obtained by hydrogenolysis of the PMB protecting group followed by Dess Martin oxidation.

These synthetic routes are flexible and substantially any stereoisomer of the lactone 9 can be made with the appropriate chiral auxiliary and reaction conditions.

Center intermediate 21 was prepared as shown in . Oxazolidinone 18 was prepared from S 3 hydroxy 2 methylpropionic methyl ester 16 by the known procedure for the preparation of ent 18. See Clark D. L. Heathcock C. H. Studies on the alkylation of chiral enolates application toward the total synthesis of discodermolide. 1993 58 5878 5879. Reduction of 18 with lithium borohydride gave the diol which was protected by anisaldehyde dimethyl acetal 19 to give the acetal 20. Deprotection of the primary TBS group with tetrabutylammonium fluoride TBAF iodination and treatment with triphenylphosphine afforded the phosphonium salt 21 in 72 yield. Phosphonium salts 22 and 23 were also used for Wittig olefination but the results were unsatisfactory. Smith also encountered difficulties with related Wittig reagents in discodermolide synthesis. See Smith A. B. Beauchamp T. J. LaMarche M. J. Kaufman M. D. Qiu Y. P. et al. Evolution of a gram scale synthesis of discodermolide. 2000 122 8654 8664. These difficulties may result at least in part from the hygroscopic nature of the phosphonium salts. In contrast compound 21 is a white non hygroscopic solid and its Wittig reactions were reliable even though no special care was taken with its storage for example salt 21 was useful for reactions even after it was stored at room temperature for several months .

As shown in the construction of the right fragment 34 featured aldol reactions. Syn Aldol reaction of aldehyde 24 with 4 provided 25 which was reduced to a diol and protected with anisaldehyde dimethyl acetal 19 to give 26. Selective opening of the benzylidine ring of 26 with DIBAL gave a primary alcohol which was oxidized to aldehyde 27. The subsequent anti aldol condensation using Heathcock s aldol reaction with dimethylphenyl propionate 28 furnished compound 29 as the major product in 73 yield. See Heathcock C. H. Pirrung M. C. Montgomery S. H. Lampe J. Acyclic stereoselection 13 Aryl esters reagents for threo aldolization. 1981 37 4087 4095. The relative configuration of intermediate 29 was confirmed by C and H NMR analyses of the corresponding acetonide 34. Silylation of the newly formed hydroxyl group of 29 reduction of the aryl ester with DIBAL and Dess Martin oxidation of the resultant primary alcohol afforded aldehyde 30. The Z diene moiety was introduced by a two step procedure developed by Paterson and coworkers using a Nozaki Hiyama reaction. See Paterson I. Schlapbach A. Studies towards the total synthesis of the marine derived immunosuppresant discodermolide stereoselective synthesis of a C Csubunit. 1995 498 500. Addition of the aldehyde 30 and allyl bromide 31 to a suspension of CrClin THF produced an intermediate hydroxy silane not shown which upon treatment with NaH underwent syn elimination to generate the required Z diene 32. Selective deprotection of the primary TBS group iodination and then treatment with triphenylphosphine gave the phosphonium salt 33 in good yield.

The first Wittig reaction of 9a with 21 provided 35 see . DIBAL reductive cleavage of the acetal followed by Dess Martin oxidation gave aldehyde 37. Likewise aldehyde 38 was made from 9b via 36. The second Wittig olefination was accomplished with 38 as an example and phosphonium salt 33 . Tetrabutylammonium fluoride deprotection followed by carbamoylation using Ko ovsky s method See Ko ovsky P. Carbamates a method of synthesis and some synthetic applications. 1986 27 5521 5524 afforded the Ccarbamate containing compound 39. The lactone was built from the methyl acetal in the left fragment by using aqueous 60 acetic acid in THF followed by Dess Martin oxidation. Deprotected analog 40 containing a free C3 hydroxy group on the lactone was obtained by the removal of MOM group with 4N HCl followed by removal of the PMB protecting groups with DDQ oxidation. Two additional example compounds 41 and 42 were prepared from the intermediate 39 by using appropriate conditions. All three of these analogs exhibited significant activity as shown in and Table 1. Surprisingly the C3 MOM protected analogs 41 and 42 showed better microtubule hypernucleation activities than the analog 40 with a free C3 hydroxy group. As can be seen in discodermolide is superior to paclitaxel taxol in that it causes equivalent microtubule assembly at both lower concentrations and temperatures the increase in absorbance caused by discodermolide occurs at a time point earlier than that caused by paclitaxel . Additionally the polymer induced to form by discodermolide is more resistant to cold induced disassembly than is the paclitaxel induced polymer. Both analogs 41 and 42 showed these more rapid polymer inducing and cold resistant properties albeit at somewhat lower potencies for example higher concentrations of the analogs were necessary for these effects to be detected than discodermolide. MOM ether lactone 41 was the most potent among these analogs.

Table 1 shows microtubule stabilizing antiproliferative and paclitaxel displacing properties of 40 42. Again the lactone MOM ether 41 was more potent than the lactol 42 or free hydroxy 40 relatives. The cellular activity of 41 was good showing a submicromolar 50 growth inhibitory GI concentration. This compound also showed considerable affinity for the paclitaxel binding site on tubulin. A 2 fold molar excess of 41 displaced H paclitaxel from microtubules better than paclitaxel and at almost the same potency as discodermolide.

Macrocycle 43 is a representative example of a dictyostatin analog with an alkyl chain bridging the lactone carbonyl group and the C10 C11 alkene and with two Z double bonds in the macrocycle. It can also be considered as a macrocyclic analog of discodermolide. This can be synthesized convergently from three components 33 21 and 44 via sequential Wittig couplings and a macrocyclization . This design allows the synthesis of substantially any stereoisomer by employing the desired isomer of the relevant precursor 21 or 33.

Fragment 45 was synthesized from 1 10 decanediol not shown by mono TBS protection NaH TBSCl 42 followed by Dess Martin oxidation 80 . Fragment 21 was prepared as shown in . Fragment 33 was prepared as shown in .

The coupling of the three fragments is summarized in . Generation of the ylide from phosphonium salt 21 and NaHDMS followed by addition of aldehyde 44 gave the Wittig product in good yield 75 provided that the reaction was conducted at high concentration 1M in 21 . The formation of the Z alkene was confirmed by the 10 Hz coupling constant between the vinyl protons. Selective opening of the PMB acetal was accomplished by addition of 3 equiv of DIBAL to give a primary alcohol. This was oxidized to an aldehyde under Dess Martin conditions. Wittig conditions similar to those above were then deployed to prepare 45 from this aldehyde and phosphonium salt 33.

Selective deprotection of 45 was achieved using HF pyridine and the resulting primary alcohol was oxidized to acid 46. The other TBS group was then removed with TBAF. Using the Yamaguchi protocol the macrolactone ring was then constructed. PMB deprotection using DDQ provided target product 43 whose protons and carbons were assigned by COSY and HMQC NMR experiments. The location of the macrolactone ring was confirmed by HMBC NMR experiments.

Acyclic compounds 47 48 and 49 were readily made from appropriate synthetic intermediates 45 or 46 in reasonable yields .

These analogs were tested for antiproliferative activity in vitro against two human cancer cell lines Table 2 . Macrolactone 43 and non cyclized alcohol 47 and ester 48 exhibited similar 50 growth inhibitory concentrations in the 15 30 M range. Carboxylic acid 49 was inactive 50 M possibly due to poor cell membrane penetration. The modest activity of these compounds is encouraging given the simplicity and flexibility of their lower chain.

We therefore decided to introduce the more complex bottom part of dictyostatin 1 lacking only the C9 OH group. The synthesis of a lower fragment more closely related to dictyostatin is shown in . Synthesis of the needed aldehyde 51 started from the intermediate 25 which was reduced to an alcohol with LiBH followed by PMB acetal protection as in . Selective acetal opening produced alcohol 50 which was subjected to Dess Martin oxidation to give aldehyde 27 see . Wittig Horner reaction and removal of the TBS group with HF pyridine gave a primary alcohol which was oxidized to aldehyde 51.

Center part Wittig salt 21 was reacted with aldehyde 51 to give the z olefin . This was followed by selective PMP acetal opening with NaCNBH TMSCl to yield a primary alcohol. The aldehyde obtained after Dess Martin oxidation was again subjected to Wittig reaction with 33 to generate 52. Ester 52 was reduced to the alcohol with DIBAL followed by Dess Martin oxidation and application of the Still z variant of the Wittig reaction to afford E Z doubly unsaturated ester 53. Selective removal of the TBS groups was accomplished by exposure to 3N HCl MeOH in THF 1 1 . The resulting ester was hydrolyzed by using 1N KOH in refluxing in EtOH. Finally the Yamaguchi lactonization protocol followed by DDQ deprotection gave macrolactone 54 whose structure was confirmed by HMBC and other NMR experiments. No isomerization of either of the dienes or the isolated cis alkenes was detected.

Compound 54 proved to be quite potent in terms of antiproliferative activity against human carcinoma cells Table 2 showing a 50 growth inhibitory concentration against breast and ovarian cancer cells of about 1 M. Furthermore compound 54 displaced H paclitaxel stoichiometrically bound to microtubules at about rd the potency of discodermolide.

A second representative general strategy for the synthesis of stereoisomers and close analogs of dictyostatin is shown in . Again the molecule is dissected such that every stereocenter can be controlled and modified either by starting with an appropriate precursor or through an asymmetric reaction allowing access to both possible isomers.

Coupling of the bottom fragment with the center fragment and elaboration are shown in . Wittig reaction of 21 and 60 proceeded smoothly to form 61 which was hydrolyzed and reduced to give 62. After tritylation to 63 DIBAL reduction gave 64. Oxidation and Wittig Horner reaction produced 65 which was reduced to give 66 and hydrolyzed to acid 67. Activation of 67 as the mixed anhydride preceded conversion to the oxazolidinone 68.

Introduction of the C16 stereocenter and introduction of the top fragment are shown in . Evans asymmetric alkylation to 69 followed by removal of the chiral auxiliary by reduction gave 70. Separately reagent 71 was made from the Evans oxazolindinone by displacement with LiCHP O OMe . Dess Martin oxidation and Horner Emmons olefination with 71 then gave 72 which was reduced with NiCl NaBHto 73. Now reduction with sodium borohydride gave a 2.8 1 mixture of stereoisomers which could be separated and converted to the final products independently. Silylation to 75 followed by DIBAL reduction gave 76 which was converted to diene 77 as described above. Detriylation then gave 78.

Completion of the synthesis is shown in . Dess Martin oxidation and Still Gennari olefination gave 79 which was deprotected with DDQ to 80. Saponification then gave the hydroxy acid 81 ready for macrocyclization. Treatment of 81 under the Yamaguchi protocol gave 82 which was finally deprotected to give the target product 83 an isomer of dictyostatin 1 called dictyostatin 5.

Representative methods to make analogs of the terminal diene fragment are shown in . Alkene 84 was ozonized to give the aldehyde which was subjected to a Wittig reaction to give analogs like 85. Alternatively 84 can be converted to the Z vinyl iodide 86 which can in turn be coupled with organometallic reagents like phenyl zinc iodide to give 87. This combination of olefination and organometallic and related coupling methods allows access to a wide variety of groups in this position.

The versatility of the synthesis is illustrated by the preparations of representative additional fragments that can be used to make dictyostatin its isomers and its analogs. summarizes the synthesis of a fully elaborated bottom fragment 92. Acetal 88 readily prepared from D malic acid was silylated with t butyldiphenylsilyl chloride TBDPSCl . Reductive cleavage of the acetal with DIBAL followed by Swern oxidation provided aldehyde 89. Reaction of 89 with the indicated Z crotyl boronate according to Roush See Roush W. R. Hoong L. K. Palmer M. A. J. Straub J. A. Palkowitz A. D. Asymmetric synthesis using tartrate modified allyl boronates. 2. Single and double asymmetric reactions with alkoxy substituted aldehydes 1990 55 4117 4126 provided 90 in 63 isolated yield. PMB protection ozonolysis and Wittig Horner olefination then gave 91. This was converted to the E Z diene 92 by DIBAL reduction Dess Martin oxidation Still Gennari olefination and desilylation with HF pyridine.
