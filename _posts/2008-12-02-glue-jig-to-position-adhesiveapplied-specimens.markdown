title: Glue jig to position adhesive-applied specimens
abstract: A jig is provided for setting and gluing pairs of specimens along their joining faces to cure into a lap joint. The jig includes a platform with a setting surface flanked by first and second upright walls, first and second plates and fasteners. The platform positions the pairs of specimens for lap joint arrangement.

The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy and thus the invention herein may be manufactured used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention relates generally to a glue jig for setting specimens or coupons to be adhesively bonded. In particular the glue jig enables several specimens to be arranged for concurrent joint arranging and curing.

Specimens or coupons can be attached together for material response testing to measure strength and shear modulus of the bond. The lap joint represents one such configuration and this can be achieved for select materials by chemical adhesive or glue.

Conventional glue jigs yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular various exemplary embodiments provide expansion in number of joints to be produced concurrently. Improved repeatability and scalability in establishing such joints over an extended curing interval represents an objective for the embodiments described in this disclosure.

Various exemplary embodiments provide a jig for setting and gluing pairs of specimens along their joining faces to cure into a lap joint. The jig includes a platform with a setting surface flanked by first and second upright walls first and second plates and fasteners. The platform positions the pairs of specimens for lap joint arrangement. The setting surface has a plurality of orifices disposed along the pairs of specimens.

The orifices are disposed along a longitudinal non joining face a lateral non joining face or a corner of adjacent specimens. The first and second plates are fastened respectively adjacent said first and second upright walls opposite the setting surface with the fasteners to tighten the plates to the upright walls. The pins are inserted into corresponding orifices to retain the pair of specimens along their non joining faces from translation along the setting surface.

The plurality of pins includes retainer pins along said longitudinal non joining face alignment pins along said lateral non joining face and stop pins at said corners of adjacent pairs of specimens. The plates include threaded orifices through which to insert the fasteners.

In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and logical mechanical and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.

The glue jig includes an upper side plate and a lower side plate to constrain a jig box . Both plates are removable upon complete curing of the adhesive. A set of thumb nuts secures the plates to the box to inhibit lateral movement. The plates include holes passing therethrough with screw threads extending half way through the thickness from outward to inward. Tightening the nuts enables the plates to hold the box in compression. The box includes a setting platform on which the specimens are positioned for gluing together and bounded by upright walls. Some specimens can be disposed to abut either wall.

The box uses retaining pins for specimen disposition along their longitudinal axes as well as glue alignment pins for specimen disposition along their lateral axes. Stop pins restrict the specimens at their corners for example where specimens abut each other The pins are secured to the box by orifices drilled through its bottom face and are disposed upright therein. These orifices correspond to the same diameter as their respective pins.

The schematic view shows four specimens first second third and fourth . The initial alignment pins restrain the specimens from lateral translation whereas the glue alignment pins restrict longitudinal sliding. The specimens are disposed with one edge or wall facing the jig box. Adhesive regions identified by dash ovals correspond to the interfacing surfaces of the specimens to be glued together.

As shown upper and lower lap joints provide an example configuration although the box is not limited thereto. The third sample adjacent the upper plate adheres to the first sample . The fourth sample adheres to the second sample adjacent the lower plate .

The glue jig is designed for Tensile Lap Adhesive Specimen Preparation for reproducible production of tensile lap thick specimens to measure strength and shear modulus of non rigid adhesives. This preparation conforms to ASTM D3983 98 Standard Test Method for Measuring Strength and Shear Modulus of Non rigid Adhesives by the Thick Adherend Tensile Lap Specimen.

Exemplary embodiments of the glue jig were developed due to restraints imposed by 1 specimen specific preparation requirements and 2 available testing equipment. The glue jig for the configuration described can hold two pairs of specimens in place for corresponding pairs of lap joints during cure interval. However this depicted arrangement is not limiting being extendible to additional specimens and or alternate types of joints. Removable side plates and retaining pins facilitate use of the jig. The metal frame is readily oiled with spray to inhibit undesired sticking if any glue is spilled on parts not intended to form the glue joint.

Procedures for use can be generalized as follows First place the first and second specimens as metal test parts with dimensions 2 0.25 0.300 into the center of the box of the glue jig so that one end of each specimen rests against the stop pins .

Second for the upper half deposit appropriate amount of glue on the first specimen as well as the third specimen against the alignment pin . Third gently tighten the side plate thumb screws . This tightens the first specimen to the third specimen thereby leaving a glue line thickness of 0.060 by 0.750 length.

Fourth repeat this process for the lower half of the Glue Jig with the second and fourth specimens . After a suitable post cure period remove the pins from the glue jig box and gently remove the test specimens and trim the excess glue from the edges and ends with an appropriate knife.

The development of this glue jig provides several advantages over the glue jig in the ASTM standard. For a single lap joint two or more specimens can be cured in the same jig. The joints can be reproducible for preparing and comparing multiple sets of specimens. Removable retaining pins facilitate removal of test specimen without prying preventing damage to the glue joint . Metal parts to be adhered in this manner can tolerate heat loads during adhesive cure multiple times and are thus less vulnerable to warp or other distortion. This type of jig can be manufactured in any size to fit a wide variety of applications.

While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein many modifications substitutions changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments.
