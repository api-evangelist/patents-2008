title: Increasing lifespan by modulation of WWP-1 and UBC-18
abstract: Ubiquitin ligase wwp-1 and ubiquitin conjugating enzyme ubc-18 are identified in nematodes as mediators of dietary restriction induced longevity and therefore as targets for modulation of lifespan in animals. Methods of screening for compounds that modulate longevity by assaying wwp-1 ubiquitination pathway parameters are provided, as are related systems. In addition, methods of using wwp-1 and/or ubc-18 to modulate longevity or delay onset of age-related diseases are described.

This application is a non provisional utility patent application claiming priority to and benefit of the following prior provisional patent application U.S. Ser. No. 60 965 152 filed Aug. 17 2007 entitled INCREASING LIFESPAN BY MODULATION OF WWP 1 AND UBC 18 by Andrea C. Carrano et al. which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

This invention was made with government support under Grant Nos. CA54418 and CA82683 from the United States Public Health Service. The government may have certain rights to this invention.

The present invention relates to the field of longevity enhancement. More specifically the present invention includes methods for increasing lifespan e.g. by modulating wwp 1 and or ubc 18 expression or activity as well as screening methods for identifying compounds that modulate longevity.

Aging in mammals or other animals can have profound negative effects on the cognitive and motor functions of the subject. Genes that regulate the aging pathways and genes that could slow pause or decrease the effects of aging and or increase lifespan are of great interest because of their potential to increase longevity or enhance quality of life during the later part of the subject s lifespan.

Studies in model organisms have shown that the aging process is regulated by conserved mechanisms. For example lifespan extension has been achieved in multiple animal systems by inactivation of the insulin like receptor signal transduction pathway Kenyon 2001 A conserved regulatory system for aging Cell 105 165 8 . Reduction of mitochondrial function has also been shown to increase lifespan. For example mutations in the iron sulfur component of complex III isp 1 increase longevity by decreasing oxygen consumption Dillin et al. 2002 Science 298 2398 401 Feng et al. 2001 Dev Cell 1 633 644 and Lee et al. 2003 Nat. Genet. 33 40 48 .

In addition reduced food intake as a result of dietary restriction increases the lifespan of a wide variety of metazoans and delays the onset of multiple age related pathologies. This is a conserved phenomenon in a number of species e.g. yeast worms flies mice waterstriders guppies chickens labradors and rats. Dietary restriction elicits a genetically programmed response to nutrient availability that cannot be explained by a simple reduction in metabolism or slower growth of the organism.

However although considerable progress has been made in understanding aging there is still need for elucidation of the pathways that influence aging as well as for novel ways to increase longevity and decrease the effects of aging.

Among other benefits the present invention meets the above needs by providing the identity of a key pathway that mediates dietary restriction induced longevity the ubiquitin pathway by providing methods for screening for modulators of aging and longevity and by providing methods for regulating longevity. A complete understanding of the invention will be obtained upon review of the following.

Ubiquitin pathway components wwp 1 and ubc 18 are shown herein to mediate dietary restriction induced longevity. The connection between these genes and longevity is used to provide screening methods e.g. whole organism and cell based methods for identifying compounds that modulate longevity and delay onset of age related diseases and conditions. Related screening systems are also provided as are compounds identified as longevity modulators using the methods and or systems herein. In addition methods are presented for using these genes to modulate longevity in an animal and to delay onset of age related diseases.

One general class of embodiments provides methods of screening for a modulator of longevity in which a non human animal that exhibits artificially altered expression or activity of wwp 1 or a homolog thereof and or of ubc 18 or a homolog thereof is provided. A test compound is administered to the non human animal and a wwp 1 ubiquitination pathway parameter in the non human animal is assayed. A change in the wwp 1 ubiquitination pathway parameter indicates that the test compound modulates longevity.

In one class of embodiments the non human animal exhibits reduced expression or activity of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof and or reduced expression or activity of ubc 18 or the homolog thereof. In one embodiment the non human animal expresses a dominant negative form of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof or a dominant negative form of ubc 18 or the homolog thereof. In another class of embodiments the non human animal overexpresses wwp 1 or the homolog thereof and or ubc 18 or the homolog thereof. In one class of embodiments the cell expresses a fusion protein comprising GFP or a homolog thereof and either wwp 1 or a homolog thereof or ubc 18 or a homolog thereof changes in expression of wwp 1 or ubc 18 can thus be easily monitored by monitoring expression of the GFP moiety in the fusion protein.

Suitable wwp 1 ubiquitination pathway parameters that can be assayed include but are not limited to one or more of lifespan an activity or expression level of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof an activity or expression level of ubc 18 or the homolog thereof an activity or expression level of pha 4 or a homolog thereof post translational modification state of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof post translational modification state of a substrate of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof e.g. cep 1 pha 4 skn 1b or other substrate described herein or known in the art and level of autophagy. Compounds that increase longevity or delay onset of age related diseases can be identified for example as those that increase lifespan of the non human animal increase expression of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof ubc 18 or the homolog thereof or pha 4 or the homolog thereof increase activity of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof ubc 18 or the homolog thereof or pha 4 or the homolog thereof increase phosphorylation of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof increase ubiquitination of the substrate of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof or increase autophagy.

Non human animals that can be employed in the screens include but are not limited to nematodes e.g. flies e.g. and typical mammalian laboratory animals such as mice rabbits and rats. Typically the animals are adults. Administration of the test compound is optionally by feeding the compound to the animal. The animals are also optionally subjected to dietary restriction e.g. reduced caloric intake during the screen or the compounds can be tested without any dietary restrictions in place. Exemplary test compounds include e.g. a small molecule a polypeptide an antibody a nucleic acid an antisense molecule or a double stranded RNA.

A related general class of embodiments provides a system for screening for compounds that modulate longevity. The system includes an array of non human animals in containers a monitoring module and a correlation module. The non human animals exhibit artificially altered expression or activity of wwp 1 or a homolog thereof and or of ubc 18 or a homolog thereof. The monitoring module monitors a wwp 1 ubiquitination pathway parameter of the non human animals in the array following administration of a test compound to the animals. The correlation module correlates a change in the wwp 1 ubiquitination pathway parameter to longevity thereby identifying the compounds that modulate longevity.

As for the methods above suitable wwp 1 ubiquitination pathway parameters include but are not limited to one or more of lifespan an activity or expression level of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof an activity or expression level of ubc 18 or the homolog thereof an activity or expression level of pha 4 or a homolog thereof post translational modification state of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof post translational modification state of a substrate of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof and level of autophagy. Compounds that increase longevity or delay onset of age related diseases can be identified for example as those that increase lifespan of the non human animal increase expression of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof ubc 18 or the homolog thereof or pha 4 or the homolog thereof increase activity of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof ubc 18 or the homolog thereof or pha 4 or the homolog thereof increase phosphorylation of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof increase ubiquitination of the substrate of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof or increase autophagy.

Non human animals that can be employed include but are not limited to nematodes e.g. flies e.g. and typical mammalian laboratory animals such as mice rabbits and rats. Typically the animals are adults. Administration of the test compound is optionally by feeding the compound to the animal. The animals are also optionally subjected to dietary restriction.

Another general class of embodiments provides methods of screening for a compound that modulates longevity in which a cell that exhibits artificially altered expression or activity of wwp 1 or a homolog thereof and or of ubc 18 or a homolog thereof is contacted with a test agent. A wwp 1 ubiquitination pathway parameter in the cell is then assayed and a change in the wwp 1 ubiquitination pathway parameter relative to a control sample without the test agent identifies the compound that modulates longevity. Exemplary test compounds include e.g. a small molecule a polypeptide an antibody a nucleic acid an antisense molecule or a double stranded RNA.

Suitable wwp 1 ubiquitination pathway parameters that can be assayed include but are not limited to one or more of an activity or expression level of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof an activity or expression level of ubc 18 or the homolog thereof an activity or expression level of pha 4 or a homolog thereof post translational modification state of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof post translational modification state of a substrate of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof e.g. cep 1 pha 4 skn 1b or other substrate described herein or known in the art and level of autophagy. Compounds that increase longevity or delay onset of age related diseases can be identified for example as those that increase expression of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof ubc 18 or the homolog thereof or pha 4 or the homolog thereof increase activity of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof ubc 18 or the homolog thereof or pha 4 or the homolog thereof increase phosphorylation of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof increase ubiquitination of the substrate of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof or increase autophagy.

Yet another general class of embodiments provides methods of identifying a modulator of longevity. In the methods a non human animal is provided. A test compound is administered to the non human animal and expression or activity of wwp 1 or a homolog thereof expression or activity of ubc 18 or a homolog thereof and or post translational modification state of wwp 1 or a homolog thereof or a substrate thereof e.g. cep 1 pha 4 skn 1b or other substrate described herein or known in the art in the animal is monitored. An increase in expression or activity of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof an increase in expression or activity of ubc 18 or the homolog thereof increased phosphorylation of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof and or increased ubiquitination of the substrate indicates that the test compound modulates e.g. increases longevity.

The animals optionally express a reporter construct that facilitates measurement of expression or activity. For example the non human animal can express a fusion protein comprising GFP or a homolog thereof and either wwp 1 or a homolog thereof or ubc 18 or a homolog thereof. In such embodiments monitoring expression of wwp 1 or ubc 18 or the homolog thereof involves monitoring an optical signal from the GFP.

Non human animals that can be employed in the screens include but are not limited to nematodes e.g. flies e.g. and typical mammalian laboratory animals such as mice rabbits and rats. Typically the animals are adults. Administration of the test compound is optionally by feeding the compound to the animal. The animals are also optionally subjected to dietary restriction e.g. reduced caloric intake during the screen or the compounds can be tested without any dietary restrictions in place. Exemplary test compounds include e.g. a small molecule a polypeptide an antibody a nucleic acid an antisense molecule or a double stranded RNA.

A related general class of embodiments provides a system for screening for compounds that modulate longevity. In this class of embodiments the system includes an array of non human animals in containers a monitoring module and a correlation module. The monitoring module monitors expression or activity of wwp 1 or a homolog thereof expression or activity of ubc 18 or a homolog thereof and or post translational modification state of wwp 1 or a homolog thereof or a substrate thereof e.g. cep 1 pha 4 skn 1b or other substrate described herein or known in the art in the non human animals in the array following administration of a test compound. The correlation module then correlates an increase in expression or activity of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof an increase in expression or activity of ubc 18 or the homolog thereof increased phosphorylation of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof and or increased ubiquitination of the substrate to longevity thereby identifying the compound s that modulate longevity.

Another general class of embodiments also provides methods of identifying a modulator of longevity. In these methods a cell is provided and contacted with a test compound. Expression or activity of wwp 1 or a homolog thereof expression or activity of ubc 18 or a homolog thereof and or post translational modification state of wwp 1 or a homolog thereof or a substrate thereof e.g. cep 1 pha 4 skn 1b or other substrate described herein or known in the art in the cell is monitored. An increase in expression or activity of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof an increase in expression or activity of ubc 18 or the homolog thereof increased phosphorylation of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof and or increased ubiquitination of the substrate indicates that the test compound modulates e.g. increases longevity.

As for the embodiments above the cells optionally express a reporter construct that facilitates measurement of expression or activity. For example the cell can express a fusion protein comprising GFP or a homolog thereof and either wwp 1 or a homolog thereof or ubc 18 or a homolog thereof. In such embodiments monitoring expression of wwp 1 or ubc 18 or the homolog thereof involves monitoring an optical signal from the GFP. Exemplary test compounds include e.g. a small molecule a polypeptide an antibody a nucleic acid an antisense molecule or a double stranded RNA.

Yet another general class of embodiments provides methods for modulating e.g. increasing longevity of an animal. In the methods expression or activity of wwp 1 or a homolog thereof and or of ubc 18 or a homolog thereof in the animal is modulated. For example expression of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof activity of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof phosphorylation of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof or expression or activity of ubc 18 or the homolog thereof can be increased.

Modulation can be effected for example by administration to the animal of a longevity modulator that affects wwp 1 or the homolog thereof or ubc 18 or the homolog thereof. Exemplary modulators include compounds that increase expression of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof decrease expression or activity of a phosphatase that dephosphorylates wwp 1 or the homolog thereof or increase expression or activity of a kinase that phosphorylates wwp 1 or the homolog thereof.

The animal can be a human or it can be a non human animal. The animal is optionally also subjected to dietary restriction.

Yet another general class of embodiments provides methods of delaying onset of an age related disease such as diabetes a cardiovascular disease or a neurodegenerative disease in an animal. In these methods expression or activity of wwp 1 or a homolog thereof and or of ubc 18 or a homolog thereof in the animal is modulated e.g. increased or decreased . As for the embodiments above modulation can be effected e.g. by administration of a longevity modulator that affects wwp 1 or the homolog thereof or ubc 18 or the homolog thereof. The animal can be a human or it can be a non human animal. The animal is optionally also subjected to dietary restriction.

Unless defined otherwise all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the invention pertains. The following definitions supplement those in the art and are directed to the current application and are not to be imputed to any related or unrelated case e.g. to any commonly owned patent or application. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice for testing of the present invention the preferred materials and methods are described herein. Accordingly the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting.

As used in this specification and the appended claims the singular forms a an and the include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus for example reference to a modulator optionally includes a combination of modulators reference to a cell includes mixtures or populations of cells and the like.

 Longevity and or lifespan or life span is used herein to refer to the length of a subject s life e.g. the number of years months weeks days minutes etc. in the lifespan of an animal. The subjects of the invention are typically non human animals e.g. rodents nematodes or flies when screening methods are employed but are also optionally humans when treatment or modulation of longevity is claimed. As used herein an increase or modulation of longevity also optionally includes a delay in the onset of age related diseases and or conditions and or a delay and or stabilization of the aging process.

 Dietary restriction refers to restriction in caloric intake of an animal e.g. a subject being tested for longevity modulation. Typically an animal subjected to dietary restriction receives about 70 of its normal caloric intake e.g. while receiving all necessary nutrients and vitamins. In some embodiments an animal may receive only about 60 or about 50 of its normal caloric intake when subjected to dietary restriction. Dietary restriction as used herein can also refer to models that are commonly used to simulate dietary restriction such as mutant animals that are used as a genetic surrogate of dietary restriction for example nematodes that mimic dietary restriction with a reduced rate of pharyngeal pumping that is representative of reduced eating . Optionally in worms dietary restriction takes the form of bacterial dietary restriction which involves limiting the concentration of bacteria fed to worms in culture.

A modulator of a specified trait or phenotype is a compound that affects that trait or phenotype. For example a modulator of aging or longevity can slow aging or increase longevity in an animal to which the modulator is administered. Generally a modulator is a compound that modulates expression and or activity of a given gene protein polypeptide mRNA or the like e.g. to produce a phenotypic change such as increase in lifespan. The term modulate refers to a change in an expression level activity or property of the gene protein etc. For example modulation can cause an increase or a decrease in a protein activity e.g. catalytic activity or binding characteristic e.g. binding of a transcription factor to a nucleic acid . Modulation can e.g. cause an increase or decrease in expression of one or more genes e.g. a change in transcription level a change in stability of an mRNA that encodes a polypeptide a change in translation efficiency and or a change in protein stability. Change in apparent protein activity can arise from changes in its expression as additional examples a modulator can change activate or inhibit activity of the polypeptide itself for example by binding to the polypeptide and stabilizing a catalytically active conformation thereof by binding to and inhibiting the polypeptide or by affecting post translational modification of the polypeptide and thus changing its activity. In addition a modulator of the invention can result in a change in lifespan or a delay in the onset of an age related disease or condition. Exemplary modulators include but are not limited to wwp 1 and ubc 18 ligands antibodies agonists antagonists complexes thereof interfering RNAs etc. Modulators of the invention are identified e.g. from a group of test compounds or test agents that include but are not limited to polypeptides proteins antibodies nucleic acids antisense molecules DNAs RNAs double stranded RNAs small molecules hormones transcription factors and the like.

Aging is the accumulation of diverse adverse changes that typically increase the risk of disease or death or reduce quality of life. These changes can be attributed e.g. to development genetic defects the environment disease and the inborn aging process. The modulators or test agents of the present invention can inhibit aging e.g. in adult subjects thereby increasing lifespan or longevity. In addition the modulators of the present invention can also protect against one or more age related diseases in a subject. Delaying onset of these diseases or conditions e.g. delaying the time at which a subject begins to exhibit symptoms of the diseases can also increase lifespan.

A polypeptide is a polymer comprising two or more amino acid residues e.g. a peptide or a protein . The polymer can additionally comprise non amino acid elements such as labels quenchers blocking groups or the like and can optionally comprise modifications such as glycosylation or the like. The amino acid residues of the polypeptide can be natural or non natural and can be unsubstituted unmodified substituted or modified.

The term fusion protein indicates that the protein includes polypeptide components derived from more than one parental protein or polypeptide. Typically a fusion protein is expressed from a fusion gene in which a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide sequence from one protein is appended in frame with and optionally separated by a linker from a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide sequence from a different protein. The fusion gene can then be expressed by a cell as a single protein.

A post translational modification of a protein is a transformation generally an enzymatic transformation that occurs following translation of some or all of the protein s amino acid residues. Typically post translational modification involves attachment of a small chemical group or groups to a functional group of certain amino acid residues e.g. the epsilon amino group of lysine or the hydroxyl group of serine threonine or tyrosine or to the protein s terminal amino or carboxyl group. Examples include but are not limited to phosphorylation glycosylation acetylation lipidation e.g. prenylation farnesylation myristoylation attachment of a fatty acid or a GPI anchor ubiquitination sumoylation hydroxylation methylation and nucleotidylation e.g. ADP ribosylation .

 Ubiquitination also called ubiquitylation of a protein involves the post translational attachment of one or more ubiquitin chains to the protein. Ubiquitination can for example affect the protein s stability e.g. target the protein for proteasomal degradation protein protein interactions e.g. with ubiquitin binding domain proteins activity and or subcellular localization. Ubiquitination typically depends on a three component enzyme system E1 E2 and E3. The E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme forms a thioester bond between its active cysteine and a ubiquitin moiety the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme transfers this activated ubiquitin moiety to the target protein or onto a growing polyubiquitin chain and the E3 ubiquitin ligase facilitates this reaction. Different classes of E3 ligases facilitate the transfer through different mechanisms E3 ligases containing a characteristic HECT Homologous to E6 AP C Terminus domain serve as a catalytic intermediate in the transfer of ubiquitin chains from the E2 to the substrate. E3 ligases can e.g. modify the protein substrate by monoubiquitination and can singly or multiply monoubiquitinate the substrate or by sequential attachment of ubiquitin moieties to form polyubiquitin chains. In some instances ubiquitination e.g. monoubiquitination can involve E2 and not require E3. See e.g. Bernassola et al. 2008 The HECT family of E3 ubiquitin ligases Multiple players in cancer development Cancer Cell 14 10 21.

The term nucleic acid or polynucleotide encompasses any physical string of monomer units that can be corresponded to a string of nucleotides including a polymer of nucleotides e.g. a typical DNA or RNA polymer PNAs modified oligonucleotides e.g. oligonucleotides comprising nucleotides that are not typical to biological RNA or DNA such as 2 O methylated oligonucleotides and the like. A nucleic acid can be e.g. single stranded or double stranded. Unless otherwise indicated a particular nucleic acid sequence of this invention encompasses complementary sequences in addition to the sequence explicitly indicated. The terms DNA and RNA include but are not limited to all single stranded and double stranded nucleic acid sequences or polynucleotides such as cDNA mRNA antisense molecules interfering RNAs oligonucleotides and the like. In addition the nucleic acids of the invention include naturally occurring and non naturally occurring nucleotide analogs and backbone substitutes e.g. PNA that one of skill in the art would recognize as capable of substituting for naturally occurring nucleotides and backbones of nucleic acids.

The term antibody herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies polyclonal antibodies multispecific antibodies e.g. bispecific antibodies formed from at least two intact antibodies chimeric antibodies humanized antibodies and antibody fragments whether produced e.g. by the modification of whole antibodies or synthesized de novo using recombinant DNA methodologies so long as they exhibit a desired biological activity. An antibody is a protein comprising one or more polypeptides substantially or partially encoded by immunoglobulin genes or fragments of immunoglobulin genes. The recognized immunoglobulin genes include the kappa lambda alpha gamma delta epsilon and mu constant region genes as well as myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. An intact antibody is one comprising heavy and light variable domains as well as an Fc region. Antibody fragments comprise a portion of an intact antibody preferably comprising the antigen binding region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab Fab F ab and Fv fragments diabodies linear antibodies single chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. Antibody fragments are optionally produced using enzymatic digestion of intact antibodies or synthesized chemically or by recombinant DNA methods. The subunit structures and three dimensional configurations of different classes and fragments of immunoglobulins are well known and the term antibody as used herein includes all configurations fragments and classes. Methods of making and using antibodies are well known to those of skill in the art.

A wwp 1 polypeptide is a polypeptide that is the same as a splice variant of an isoform of or homologous to a naturally occurring wwp 1 polypeptide e.g. a wwp 1 or that is derived from such a polypeptide e.g. through cloning recombination mutation or the like . The polypeptide can be full length or a fragment of a full length protein. A wwp 1 fragment typically includes at least 10 contiguous amino acids corresponding to a native wwp 1 protein such as nematode wwp 1 and optionally includes catalytically active as well as catalytically inactive fragments. The fragment optionally includes at least about 25 at least about 50 at least about 75 at least about 100 at least about 250 at least about 500 or about 1000 or more contiguous amino acids corresponding to the native protein.

A ubc 18 polypeptide is a polypeptide that is the same as a splice variant of an isoform of or homologous to a naturally occurring ubc 18 polypeptide e.g. a ubc 18 or that is derived from such a polypeptide e.g. through cloning recombination mutation or the like . The polypeptide can be full length or a fragment of a full length protein. A ubc 18 fragment typically includes at least 10 contiguous amino acids corresponding to a native ubc 18 protein such as nematode ubc 18 and optionally includes active as well as inactive fragments. The fragment optionally includes at least about 25 at least about 50 at least about 75 at least about 100 at least about 250 at least about 500 or about 1000 or more contiguous amino acids corresponding to the native protein.

All polypeptides of the invention e.g. wwp 1 ubc 18 pha 4 sod proteins foxa proteins and the like can be naturally occurring or recombinant and are optionally unpurified purified or isolated and exist e.g. in vitro in vivo or in situ.

A wwp 1 gene or polynucleotide is a nucleic acid that encodes a wwp 1 polypeptide. Typically the gene includes regulatory sequences that direct expression of the gene in one or more cells of interest. Optionally the gene is a native gene that includes regulatory and coding sequences that naturally direct expression of a wwp 1 polypeptide e.g. in a nematode such as or other animal. It is understood that polynucleotides encoding all or varying portions of wwp 1 are included herein. Optionally wwp 1 polynucleotides encode a polypeptide with wwp 1 activity e.g. ubiquitin ligase activity. Such polynucleotides include naturally occurring synthetic and intentionally manipulated polynucleotides as well as splice variants. For example portions of the mRNA sequence may be altered due to alternate RNA splicing patterns or the use of alternate promoters for RNA transcription.

A ubc 18 gene or polynucleotide is a nucleic acid that encodes a ubc 18 polypeptide. Typically the gene includes regulatory sequences that direct expression of the gene in one or more cells of interest. Optionally the gene is a native gene that includes regulatory and coding sequences that naturally direct expression of a ubc 18 polypeptide e.g. in a nematode such as or other animal. It is understood that polynucleotides encoding all or varying portions of ubc 18 are included herein. Optionally ubc 18 polynucleotides encode a polypeptide with ubc 18 activity e.g. ubiquitin conjugating activity. Such polynucleotides include naturally occurring synthetic and intentionally manipulated polynucleotides as well as splice variants. For example portions of the mRNA sequence may be altered due to alternate RNA splicing patterns or the use of alternate promoters for RNA transcription.

Moreover polynucleotides of the invention e.g. wwp 1 polynucleotides ubc 18 polynucleotides or the like include polynucleotides having alterations in the nucleic acid sequence that still encode a polypeptide having the ability to modulate a wwp 1 ubiquitination pathway parameter such as longevity lifespan and response to dietary restriction.

As used herein the terms wwp 1 ubc 18 pha 4 and the like refer to either the gene the transcribed RNA or its translated polypeptide unless specifically stated otherwise. The term wwp 1 is also used herein to refer to a gene and its protein and any homologs or orthologs thereof therefore while the invention is described primarily with reference to wwp 1 any of its homologs e.g. or mammalian homologs e.g. mammalian WWP1 WWP2 and ITCH is also contemplated. Thus wwp 1 also include genes homologous to and genes whose protein products are homologous or substantially identical to the protein product of the wwp 1 gene e.g. as presented in Genbank accession no. NM171831 see also SEQ ID NOs 9 and 10 for amino acid and nucleotide sequences respectively examples of such orthologs include human wwp1 Genbank accession no. NM007013 human wwp2 Genbank accession no. NM025830 and human itch Genbank accession no. NM031483 . Similarly the term ubc 18 is also used herein to refer to a gene and its protein and any homologs or orthologs thereof therefore while the invention is described primarily with reference to ubc 18 any of its homologs e.g. or mammalian homologs e.g. mammalian UBCH7 is also contemplated. Thus ubc 18 also include genes homologous to and genes whose protein products are homologous or substantially identical to the protein product of the ubc 18 gene e.g. as presented in Genbank accession no. NM066140 see also SEQ ID NOs 11 and 12 for amino acid and nucleotide sequences respectively examples of such orthologs include human ubch7 Genbank accession no. AJ000519 . The same convention is used for all other genes and proteins discussed herein. For example pha 4 also include genes homologous to and genes whose protein products are homologous or substantially identical to the protein product of the pha 4 gene e.g. as presented in Genbank accession no. NM001047651 see also SEQ ID NOs 13 and 14 for amino acid and nucleotide sequences respectively .

The term gene is used broadly to refer to any nucleic acid associated with a biological function. Genes typically include coding sequences and or the regulatory sequences required for expression of coding sequences. The term gene applies to a specific genomic sequence as well as to a cDNA or an mRNA encoded by that genomic sequence. Genes also include non expressed nucleic acid segments that for example form recognition sequences for other proteins. Non expressed regulatory sequences include promoters and enhancers to which regulatory proteins such as transcription factors bind resulting in transcription of adjacent or nearby sequences. In some cases a gene is heritable. In some aspects genes comprise coding sequences e.g. an open reading frame or coding region necessary for the production of a polypeptide while in other aspects genes do not encode a polypeptide. Examples of genes that do not encode polypeptides include ribosomal RNA genes rRNA and transfer RNA tRNA genes. Genes of use in the present invention include but are not limited to wwp 1 wwp1 wwp2 itch ubc 18 ubch7 pha 4 daf 16 foxa sod and other genes involved in longevity and dietary restriction pathways.

 Expression of a gene or expression of a nucleic acid means transcription of DNA into RNA optionally including modification of the RNA e.g. splicing translation of RNA into a polypeptide possibly including subsequent modification e.g. posttranslational modification or both transcription and translation. Reduced expression e.g. of wwp 1 or ubc 18 refers to a situation in which a particular gene in a cell or animal is not translated at the same level as it would be in a wild type or unmodified organism whether because transcription translation or both are reduced. Reduced expression includes a condition in which expression of the gene does not occur at all e.g. a knock out gene as well as conditions in which expression levels are merely reduced as compared to the gene in a wild type organism or cell. Overexpression e.g. of wwp 1 or ubc 18 refers to a situation in which a particular gene in a cell or animal is translated at a higher level than it would be in a wild type or unmodified organism whether because transcription translation or both are increased. The expression level of a gene is the level at which the gene is expressed in a cell or organism and can include the level at which the gene is transcribed and or the level at which it is translated into a protein. Activity level is also used to refer to the activity of the protein e.g. an enzyme and its level of activity in a cell e.g. enzymatic or binding activity of a protein encoded by the gene at issue. A cell or animal expressing wwp 1 and or ubc 18 includes any sample comprising a functional wwp 1 and or ubc 18 gene its transcribed RNA s and or translated polypeptide s .

Expression or activity is artificially altered when it is altered by human intervention. For example a gene can be overexpressed or can be expressed at lower levels than in a wild type organism or cell as a result of human intervention or a naturally occurring gene can be replaced e.g. with a construct encoding a dominant negative protein or with a reporter gene encoding a fusion protein that is expressed at approximately wild type levels. As another example such a construct or reporter can be expressed in addition to the naturally occurring gene. Expression of a gene can be artificially altered for example using recombinant DNA techniques to alter e.g. its coding region s and or regulatory element s by insertion of a transposable element or by exposing it to a chemical ionizing radiation or the like and then performing in vitro or in vivo selection for a desired mutated form of the gene. Expression can be affected e.g. by artificially introduced point mutations insertions of one or more nucleotides or amino acids when referring to an encoded polypeptide transposon insertions and deletions of one or more nucleotides or amino acids or by use of RNA interference or similar techniques e.g. introduction or expression of a small interfering RNA short hairpin RNA an antisense nucleic acid etc. to eliminate or reduce expression of the gene. Activity e.g. specific activity of a protein can be similarly artificially altered e.g. by affecting its expression level by mutations e.g. point mutations deletions insertions fusions etc. that directly affect activity without affecting expression level or by controlling post translational modifications that affect activity e.g. increasing or decreasing phosphorylation level or the like .

The term recombinant indicates that the material e.g. a nucleic acid or a protein has been artificially or synthetically non naturally altered by human intervention. The alteration can be performed on the material within or removed from its natural environment or state. For example a recombinant nucleic acid is one that is made by recombining nucleic acids e.g. during cloning DNA shuffling or other procedures a recombinant polypeptide or recombinant protein is a polypeptide or protein which is produced by expression of a recombinant nucleic acid.

A wwp 1 ubiquitination pathway parameter refers to a measurable parameter that is mediated by wwp 1 and or ubc 18 such as longevity lifespan level of autophagy and or response to dietary restriction. In addition a wwp 1 ubiquitination pathway parameter is optionally an activity or expression level of wwp 1 e.g. activity of a wwp 1 polypeptide transcription of a wwp 1 gene into mRNA or translation level an activity or expression level of ubc 18 e.g. activity of a ubc 18 polypeptide transcription of a ubc 18 gene into mRNA or translation level or activity or expression of any gene or polypeptide that can be correlated to wwp 1 and or ubc 18. For example pha 4 functions downstream of wwp 1 and thus its expression or activity can be used as a wwp 1 ubiquitination pathway parameter. Similarly post translational modification state of various proteins can be used as wwp 1 ubiquitination pathway parameters for example phosphorylation state of wwp 1 which is correlated with its activity and ubiquitination state of wwp 1 substrates which is correlated with wwp 1 and ubc 18 activity .

The term age related disease is used herein to refer to diseases conditions and symptoms that are predominantly found or manifested in older animals e.g. in humans people over 50 or more preferably people over 65. For any animal age related diseases would manifest after maturation e.g. post development. The age at which maturity is reached is different depending on the animal and for each animal such time would be well known to those of skill in the art. Age related diseases include certain cancers cardiovascular disease atherosclerosis hypertension diabetes e.g. type 2 osteoporosis depression neurodegenerative disease Alzheimer s Parkinson s glaucoma certain immune system defects kidney failure liver steatosis and other conditions well known to those of skill in the art.

The term animal refers to an invertebrate or vertebrate animal. In some aspects e.g. when describing treatment and diagnostic procedures animals include humans while other aspects e.g. most screening procedures relate only to non human animals. Exemplary non human animals include but are not limited to insects e.g. including nematodes e.g. mammals non human primates rodents e.g. mice rats and hamsters stock and domesticated animals e.g. pigs cows sheep horses cats and dogs and birds. In certain embodiments animals amenable to transformation techniques are particularly useful. As used herein the term animal refers to either a whole animal an animal organ an animal cell or a group of animal cells such as an animal tissue for example depending upon the context.

An autophagy pathway parameter refers to a measurable parameter mediated by a member of the pathway that regulates autophagy particularly autophagy that is induced or stimulated by dietary restriction and that is involved in lifespan extension e.g. wwp 1 ubc 18 rab 10 TOR atg 1 vps 34 bec 1 and or pha 4. Level of autophagy is an autophagy pathway parameter of particular interest herein. In addition an autophagy pathway parameter is optionally an activity or expression level or a post translational modification state of wwp 1 ubc 18 rab 10 TOR atg 1 vps 34 bec 1 pha 4 or another member of the autophagy pathway comprising these factors.

Dietary restriction is known to increase lifespan in a variety of animals including mice flies worms and others. Among other aspects genes that mediate this process are described herein and screening methods for identifying modulators of such genes are presented. By identifying modulators of the genes or their products that mediate this process methods of modulating longevity and compounds with which to do so are also provided.

Embodiments of the invention are based in part upon the identification of the HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase WWP 1 and the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UBC 18 as mediators of dietary restriction induced longevity in . Characterizing the role of wwp 1 and ubc 18 in dietary restriction and their relationship to other genes in the dietary restriction pathway provides aspects of the present invention including without limitation novel methods of identifying modulators of longevity e.g. by identifying test compounds that modulate the wwp 1 ubc 18 ubiquitination pathway to increase longevity.

In brief data presented herein show that wwp 1 and ubc 18 mediate dietary restriction induced longevity. Loss of wwp 1 or ubc 18 blocks the response to dietary restriction and overexpression of wwp 1 extends lifespan. In addition to being required for dietary restriction induced longevity wwp 1 and ubc 18 are also shown to be specific to dietary restriction induced longevity in that neither wwp 1 nor ubc 18 is required for the insulin IGF 1 or mitochondrial electron transport longevity pathways. Further loss of wwp 1 or ubc 18 is shown to block dietary restriction induced autophagy which is involved in lifespan extension. These and additional findings are described in greater detail in the Examples section below.

The studies described herein focused on the roles of wwp 1 and ubc 18 in lifespan control in and the results provide the first evidence that ubiquitination plays a positive role in lifespan determination. Targeting components of the ubiquitin pathway can thus lead to the development of new therapeutic agents. Because of the wide ranging roles of the pathway in many cellular pathways it may be difficult to limit the negative effects of agents that target the general ubiquitination machinery. However an increase in the specificity of therapeutic intervention by targeting individual ubiquitin ligases such as wwp 1 can boost the effectiveness of treatment and eliminate nonspecific side effects.

Therefore wwp 1 and ubc 18 are useful targets for screening for modulators of longevity as are other members of the pathway such as pha 4 demonstrated to be downstream of wwp 1 and ubc 18 and substrates of wwp 1 whose ubiquitination regulates dietary restriction induced longevity. In one aspect the invention provides screening methods and systems to identify compounds that alter wwp 1 ubiquitination pathway parameters such as lifespan activity or expression level of wwp 1 activity or expression level of ubc 18 activity or expression level of pha 4 post translational modification state of a substrate of wwp 1 post translational modification state of wwp 1 itself catalytic activity of the mammalian homolog ITCH is enhanced by phosphorylation see Gallagher et al. 2006 Activation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch through a phosphorylation induce conformational change Proc Nat Acad Sci 103 1717 1722 autophagy or other parameters correlated with lifespan. Such compounds are then optionally used to increase longevity e.g. to treat a patient suffering from premature aging or to extend normal lifespan.

Before describing the present invention in detail it is to be understood that the invention herein is not necessarily limited to use with wwp 1 ubc 18 or other dietary restriction induced longevity autophagy and ubiquitin pathway factors but also includes homologs or orthologs thereof. As just a few examples use of the mammalian ligases WWP1 WWP2 and ITCH with which wwp 1 is highly conserved is contemplated as is use of mammalian UBCH7 which shows similarity to ubc 18.

Dietary restriction reduces the incidence of age related diseases such as cancer cardiovascular disease and diabetes in mammals and has been found to improve functional outcome in models of Alzheimer s Parkinson s and Huntington s disease. A detailed understanding of the pathways that mediate the benefits of DR can thus also lead to novel therapies for age related diseases as described herein.

In one aspect methods of identifying compounds that modulate longevity and or delay onset of age related diseases or conditions e.g. by modulating an activity or expression level of a wwp 1 or ubc 18 gene or polypeptide or other gene or protein involved in the dietary restriction pathway are provided. Generally in the methods a cell or non human animal is contacted with or administered a test compound also called a test agent herein and a parameter related to the wwp 1 ubc 18 ubiquitin pathway is assayed. Suitable parameters include but are not limited to expression or activity of wwp 1 or a homolog thereof expression or activity of ubc 18 or a homolog thereof expression or activity of a downstream factor for example pha 4 sod 1 sod 2 sod 4 sod 5 or a homolog of any thereof such as a mammalian foxa post translational modification state of wwp 1 or a homolog thereof post translational modification state of a wwp 1 or ubc 18 substrate lifespan level of authophagy time of onset of an age related disease or condition or binding of the test compound to one of the above genes or polypeptides or complexes thereof. By assaying changes in these parameters compounds or combinations of compounds that modify e.g. increase longevity are identified. Compounds identified by these methods are also a feature of the invention as are systems for conveniently screening test compounds to identify modulators of longevity.

Test compounds or agents for use in the methods provided include but are not limited to polypeptides proteins antibodies nucleic acids antisense molecules small molecules e.g. a compound with a molecular weight less than 1000 daltons hormones transcription factors interfering RNAs e.g. double stranded RNAs siRNAs etc. ions carbohydrates organic or inorganic compounds protein fragments nucleic acid fragments antibody fragments and the like and are optionally selected from natural or synthetic molecules. A test compound is optionally an antagonist of a dietary restriction pathway polypeptide or gene an agonist of such a polypeptide or gene a ligand that specifically binds to a polypeptide or gene of the invention an antibody that specifically binds to a polypeptide or gene in the pathway or the like. For example a test compound or modulator of the invention is optionally a ligand or other compound that alters e.g. increases expression of wwp 1 and or ubc 18 or alters e.g. increases activity of wwp 1 and or ubc 18. Exemplary compounds that increase activity of wwp 1 include but are not limited to compounds that bind wwp 1 and stabilize its catalytically active conformation compounds that prevent or decrease binding of an inhibitor to wwp 1 compounds that activate a kinase that phosphorylates and thus activates wwp 1 e.g. jnk and compounds that inhibit a phosphatase that dephosphorylates and thus inactivates wwp 1.

Libraries of test compounds to be screened for potential modulators are available. These libraries are optionally random or targeted. Targeted libraries include those designed using any form of a rational design technique that selects scaffolds or building blocks to generate combinatorial libraries. These techniques include a number of methods for the design and combinatorial synthesis of target focused libraries including morphing with bioisosteric transformations analysis of target specific privileged structures and the like. In general where information regarding structure of wwp 1 ubc 18 ubiquitin pathway genes or gene products is available e.g. wwp 1 ubc 18 a kinase or phosphatase that acts on wwp 1 etc. likely binding partners can be designed e.g. using flexible docking approaches or the like. Similarly random libraries exist for a variety of basic chemical scaffolds. In either case many thousands of scaffolds and building blocks for chemical libraries are available including those with polypeptide nucleic acid carbohydrate and other backbones. Commercially available libraries and library design services include those offered by Chemical Diversity San Diego Calif. Affymetrix Santa Clara Calif. Sigma St. Louis Mo. ChemBridge Research Laboratories San Diego Calif. TimTec Newark Del. Nuevolution A S Copenhagen Denmark and many others see also the section entitled Test Compound Libraries hereinbelow.

In a screen for modulators optionally a panel of different test compounds or potential modulators i.e. two or more are administered to different animals e.g. isogenic or near isogenic animals or contacted with different cell populations the effect of each compound on the phenotype is monitored and one or more modulators having the desired effect are identified.

In general test compounds that enhance activity or expression of wwp 1 and or ubc 18 are desirable e.g. to modulate lifespan. Identification of compounds that increase longevity or delay onset of age related diseases is optionally achieved by utilizing the genes and or polypeptides of the invention including active fragments thereof in cell free assays cell based assays and or whole organism assays e.g. in nematodes or other model organisms. A variety of formats are applicable including measurement of lifespan expression or activity e.g. using any of the parameters described above as will be described in greater detail below.

In one aspect cell free assays are employed to identify compounds that modulate longevity or onset of age related diseases. In one embodiment cell free assays for identifying such compounds comprise a mixture containing a wwp 1 and or ubc 18 polypeptide or gene or homologs or orthologs thereof and a test compound or a library of test compounds. In the cell free assay binding of the test compounds to the wwp 1 and or ubc 18 polypeptides or genes is measured e.g. to prescreen a library of compounds. Any compounds that specifically bind to wwp 1 and or ubc 18 are then optionally tested in further cell free assays a cell based assay or a whole organism assay e.g. for an effect on lifespan gene expression or protein activity. Detection of the formation of complexes is achieved by conventional methods well known to those of skill in the art.

For example in one embodiment a library of test compounds is synthesized on a solid substrate e.g. a solid surface plastic pins or some other surface. The test compounds are reacted with a polypeptide and or gene and washed to elute unbound polypeptide. Bound polypeptide and or gene is are then detected by methods well known in the art. A reciprocal assay can also be used e.g. in which the polypeptides and or genes of interest e.g. wwp 1 and or ubc 18 are applied directly onto plates and binding of a test compound to the polypeptides or genes is detected. An antibody or other ligand binding to a polypeptide and or gene of interest is optionally detected in either format. For example a ligand that binds to a wwp 1 and or ubc 18 gene or polypeptide can be identified in this manner.

Interaction between molecules is also optionally assessed using real time BIA Biomolecular Interaction Analysis e.g. using devices from Pharmacia Biosensor AB which detect surface plasmon resonance an optical phenomenon . Detection depends on changes in the mass concentration of macromolecules at the biospecific interface and does not require specific labeling of the molecules. In one useful embodiment a library of test compounds is immobilized on a sensor surface e.g. a wall of a micro flow cell. A solution containing a wwp 1 and or ubc 18 polypeptide or gene is then continuously circulated over the sensor surface. An alteration in the resonance angle as indicated on a signal recording indicates the occurrence of an interaction. This general technique is described in more detail in the by Pharmacia.

Optionally a wwp 1 and or ubc 18 polypeptide or gene is immobilized to facilitate separation of complexes formed between the polypeptide or gene of interest and a test compound from uncomplexed forms of the polypeptide or gene. This also facilitates automation of the assay. Complexation of wwp 1 and or ubc 18 can be achieved in any type of vessel e.g. microtiter plates microfluidic chambers or channels micro centrifuge tubes and test tubes. In one embodiment a wwp 1 and or ubc 18 polypeptide is fused to another protein e.g. glutathione S transferase to form a fusion protein which is adsorbed onto a matrix e.g. glutathione SEPHAROSE beads Sigma Chemical. St. Louis Mo. which is then combined with a radiolabeled test compound or test compound library and incubated under conditions sufficient to form test compound polypeptide complexes. Subsequently the beads are washed to remove unbound label and the matrix is immobilized and the radiolabel is determined. Similar methods for immobilizing proteins on matrices use biotin and streptavidin. For example a protein can be biotinylated using biotin NHS N hydroxy succinimide using well known techniques and immobilized in the well of streptavidin coated plates. The immobilized wwp 1 and or ubc 18 is then used to test for binding of test compounds.

Cell free assays for wwp 1 and or ubc 18 activity are described in the Examples section below. In one embodiment a test compound optionally but not necessarily pre screened for binding to wwp 1 and or ubc 18 as described above is added to such a cell free assay and its effect on wwp 1 and or ubc 18 activity is monitored. Activators test compounds that increase ubiquitination of one or more substrates by wwp 1 and ubc 18 in the cell free assay or inhibitors test compounds that decrease ubiquitination of one or more substrates by wwp 1 and ubc 18 in the cell free assay can thus be identified.

It will be evident that similar considerations apply to other cell free assays. For example test compounds can be screened for binding to a kinase or phosphatase that acts on wwp 1. As another example test compounds can be screened in cell free assays including the test compound the kinase or phosphatase and wwp 1 and optionally including ubc 18 and or a wwp 1 substrate. Whether the test compound activates or inhibits the kinase or phosphatase can be monitored e.g. by assessing phosphorylation state of wwp 1 or by assaying wwp 1 activity by assaying ubiquitination state of the substrate.

Test compounds that are identified in cell free assays are then optionally screened further for modulation of lifespan or other wwp 1 ubiquitination pathway parameters e.g. in cell based or whole organism methods as described below.

In one aspect of the invention cell based assays are used for identifying compounds that modulate longevity or onset of age related disease e.g. compounds that bind to activate and or modulate wwp 1 ubc 18 and or other factors that mediate dietary restriction induced longevity. In certain exemplary embodiments expression of wwp 1 or ubc 18 has been altered in the cells employed while in other exemplary embodiments the cells exhibit wild type expression of wwp 1 and ubc 18.

Accordingly one general class of embodiments provides methods of screening for a compound that modulates longevity in which a cell e.g. a population of cells that exhibits artificially altered expression or activity of wwp 1 or a homolog thereof and or of ubc 18 or a homolog thereof is contacted with a test agent. A wwp 1 ubiquitination pathway parameter in the cell is then assayed and a change in the wwp 1 ubiquitination pathway parameter relative to a control sample e.g. a control cell without the test agent identifies the compound that modulates longevity.

As noted above expression and activity can be altered using any of a wide variety of techniques known in the art e.g. through recombinant DNA techniques mutagenesis or the like.

In one class of embodiments the cell exhibits reduced expression or activity of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof and or reduced expression or activity of ubc 18 or the homolog thereof. For example expression or activity can be reduced by at least 50 at least 75 or at least 90 or can be undetectable. As just a few examples expression and or activity can be reduced using RNA interference or antisense techniques to decrease expression or through mutations e.g. point mutations insertions or deletions that decrease expression at an mRNA or protein level or that render the protein less active or inactive. In one embodiment the cell expresses a dominant negative form of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof e.g. wwp 1 having a point mutation at the catalytic cysteine see the Examples section below or a dominant negative form of ubc 18 or the homolog thereof e.g. ubc 18 having a point mutation at the catalytic cysteine . Such cells exhibiting reduced expression or activity of wwp 1 or ubc 18 can be useful for example in screens for compounds that increase expression or activity of wwp 1 ubc 18 or a component downstream thereof.

In another class of embodiments the cell overexpresses wwp 1 or the homolog thereof and or ubc 18 or the homolog thereof. For example a transcript and or translated product can be present in the cell at an amount that is at least 2 at least 5 at least 10 at least 50 or even at least 100 normal for that cell type including expression in a cell not normally expressing the gene . In a related class of embodiments the cell expresses a constitutively active form of wwp 1 or ubc 18 for example wwp 1 with a mutation disrupting an inhibitory interaction between its WW and HECT domains.

In some embodiments the artificial alteration in expression provides a convenient way to assay the wwp 1 ubiquitination pathway parameter. For example the cell can express a recombinant reporter construct whose expression is easily monitored. In one such embodiment the cell expresses a fusion protein comprising GFP green fluorescent protein or a homolog thereof e.g. YFP CFP RFP etc. and either wwp 1 or a homolog thereof or ubc 18 or a homolog thereof typically under control of an endogenous wwp 1 or ubc 18 or homologous promoter see e.g. the Examples section below. Changes in expression of wwp 1 or ubc 18 can thus be easily monitored by monitoring expression of the GFP moiety in the fusion protein. It will be evident that essentially any similar reporter can be substituted for GFP e.g. another fluorescent moiety a reporter enzyme an epitope tag etc. The reporter construct can replace the corresponding native gene in the cell or can be in addition to the native gene.

Suitable wwp 1 ubiquitination pathway parameters that can be assayed include but are not limited to one or more of an activity or expression level of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof an activity or expression level of ubc 18 or the homolog thereof an activity or expression level of pha 4 or a homolog thereof e.g. mammalian foxa1 foxa2 or foxa3 or another downstream factor e.g. a sod such as sod 1 sod 2 sod 4 or sod 5 post translational modification state of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof post translational modification state of a substrate of wwp 1 or ubc 18 or the homolog thereof and level of autophagy. Other parameters that can optionally be assayed include e.g. expression or activity level or post translational modification state of autophagy pathway members such as rab 10 TOR atg 1 vps 34 or bec 1 or a homolog thereof. Compounds that increase longevity or delay onset of age related diseases can be identified for example as those that increase expression of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof ubc 18 or the homolog thereof or pha 4 or the homolog thereof increase activity of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof ubc 18 or the homolog thereof or pha 4 or the homolog thereof increase phosphorylation of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof or increase ubiquitination of the substrate of wwp 1 or ubc 18 or the homolog thereof e.g. by at least 2 at least 5 at least 10 at least 50 or even at least 100 normal for that cell type. Similarly compounds of interest can increase autophagy e.g. by at least 2 at least 5 at least 10 at least 50 or even at least 100 decrease expression or activity of rab 10 or TOR or the homolog thereof or increase expression or activity of atg 1 vps 34 or bec 1 or the homolog thereof.

Another general class of embodiments also provides methods of identifying a modulator of longevity. In these methods a cell is provided typically a cell or population of cells expressing or capable of expressing wwp 1 ubc 18 and or other genes in the dietary restriction pathway and contacted with a test compound. Expression or activity of wwp 1 or a homolog thereof expression or activity of ubc 18 or a homolog thereof and or post translational modification state of wwp 1 or a homolog thereof or a substrate thereof in the cell is monitored. A change e.g. an increase in expression or activity of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof a change e.g. an increase in expression or activity of ubc 18 or the homolog thereof altered e.g. increased phosphorylation of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof and or altered e.g. increased ubiquitination of the substrate e.g. relative to an untreated cell indicates that the test compound modulates e.g. increases longevity. Similarly other parameters related to the wwp 1 ubc 18 ubiquitin pathway or the autophagy pathway as described herein can be monitored.

As for the embodiments above the cells optionally express a reporter construct that facilitates measurement of expression or activity. For example the cell can express a fusion protein comprising GFP or a homolog thereof and either wwp 1 or a homolog thereof or ubc 18 or a homolog thereof. In such embodiments monitoring expression of wwp 1 or ubc 18 or the homolog thereof involves monitoring an optical signal from the GFP e.g. using a fluorescence microscope a fluorimeter a plate reader etc. whether manually or in an automated system .

Yet another general class of embodiments provides methods of screening for a compound that modulates longevity and or autophagy e.g. dietary restriction induced autophagy . In the methods a cell e.g. a population of cells preferably that exhibits artificially altered expression or activity of wwp 1 or a homolog thereof and or of ubc 18 or a homolog thereof is contacted with a test agent. An autophagy pathway parameter in the cell is then assayed and a change in the autophagy pathway parameter relative to a control sample e.g. a control cell without the test agent identifies the compound that modulates longevity and or autophagy. Compounds of particular interest include those that increase autophagy or lifespan decrease expression or activity of rab 10 or TOR including homologs thereof or increase expression or activity of atg 1 vps 34 bec 1 or pha 4 or a homolog thereof . Essentially all of the features for the embodiments above apply to these methods as well as relevant.

Cells that are useful for any of the screening methods of the invention include for example human or other mammalian cells yeast cells bacterial cells insect cells avian cells amphibian cells oocytes nematode cells and essentially any other cells that express wwp 1 ubc 18 homologs thereto and or other genes of interest whether that expression is natural to the cell or the result of recombinant introduction of a wwp 1 ubc 18 or other gene of interest into the cell. Thus the cells are optionally those associated with expression of wwp 1 ubc 18 and or other genes of interest in vivo such as neuronal cells or heart brain liver or kidney cells or are derived from such cells through culture or are recombinant cells typically selected for ease of culture and manipulation expressing heterologous wwp 1 ubc 18 and or other genes of interest. The cells optionally exhibit artificially altered expression of one two or more of wwp 1 ubc 18 and other genes that mediate dietary restriction induced longevity and or optionally exhibit artificially altered expression of or comprise mutations e.g. loss of function mutations in one or more genes in the insulin IGF 1 and or mitochondrial electron transport longevity pathways and or autophagy pathway. Cells are optionally isolated e.g. not part of an animal or tissue and or cultured cells.

Expression of wwp 1 ubc 18 or any other ubiquitin or dietary restriction pathway gene of interest can be detected using techniques established in the art. References sufficient to guide one of skill through these methods are readily available including Ausubel Sambrook and Berger all infra . For example expression level can be measured by measuring transcribed mRNA e.g. via northern analysis microarray analysis or quantitative e.g. real time reverse transcription PCR.

As another example the level of expression is optionally measured by measuring the amount of translated protein. Protein expression levels can be measured e.g. using immunoassays such as western blotting dot blotting ELISA immunoPCR and the like or with proteomic detection methods which detect many proteins simultaneously multidimensional gel electrophoresis mass spectrometry based methods or surface plasmon resonance techniques.

Expression levels can also be detected using reporter constructs such as the GFP fusion proteins described above. Similarly promoter regions of wwp 1 ubc 18 or other gene s of interest e.g. generally sequences in the region of the start site of transcription e.g. within 5 kb of the start site e.g. 1 kb or less e.g. within 500 bp or 250 bp or 100 bp of the start site can be coupled to reporter constructs CAT beta galactosidase luciferase or any other available reporter and can be similarly tested for expression modulation by the test compound.

Post translational modification state of proteins e.g. wwp 1 or a substrate thereof can be detected using techniques like those described above for detection of protein expression. For example a particular post translationally modified form of a protein or the unmodified form can be detected by an immunoassay e.g. western blotting ELISA or immunoPCR using an antibody specific for that form. Phosphorylation of a protein can be detected for example using antibodies specific to phosphoserine phosphothreonine and or phosphotyrosine or an antibody specific for a given phosphorylated form of the protein. As another example phosphorylation can be detected by incorporation of a radioactively labeled phosphate group. Ubiquitination can be detected for example in an assay incorporating tagged ubiquitin as described in greater detail in the Examples section below.

Substrates of wwp 1 can be identified by techniques known in the art. For example an in vitro ubiquitination reaction can be performed e.g. using extract as described in the Examples section below. Ubiquitinated proteins can then be identified for example by mass spectroscopic techniques two dimensional electrophoresis and microsequencing etc. Such substrates can themselves be involved in regulation of dietary restriction induced longevity. Substrates can also be identified by genetic pathway analysis and confirmed in an in vitro assay. Exemplary substrates of interest in the context of the present invention include but are not limited to cep 1 p53 pha 4 foxa skn 1b NF E2 LKLF KLF5 Runx2 LMP2A OCT 4 endophilin Notch Occludin HEF1 Smad7 JunB c Jun p73 p63 CXCR4 Hrs Nrf1 and Nrf2.

A large number of assays for detecting activity of various enzymes and other proteins have been described in the art. Activity of wwp 1 and or ubc 18 or homologs thereof is optionally detected in an in vitro ubiquitination assay as described in the Examples section below. The substrate for such an activity assay can be e.g. a native substrate or an exogenously supplied substrate. Activity is optionally normalized e.g. to amount of cell extract total protein concentration or amount of total protein or concentration or amount of the enzyme of interest. Activity of a transcription factor can be assayed e.g. by monitoring transcription of a marker or reporter gene having a binding site for the transcription factor in its promoter. In some instances subcellular localization can be determined and correlated with activity e.g. nuclear localization for a transcription factor that shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus .

Level of autophagy can be determined by techniques known in the art. In one exemplary technique a reporter construct that indicates the presence of autophagocytic vesicles is employed. For example a GFP tagged LGG 1 protein or homolog thereof can be visualized as described in Hansen et al. 2008 A role for autophagy in the extension of lifespan by dietary restriction in PLoS Genetics 4 2 e24 and references therein. LGG 1 is incorporated into pre autophagosomal and autophagosomal membranes. The GFP LGG 1 reporter is localized to puncta in cells with increased numbers of autophagic vesicles and the appearance of such puncta is employed as an indicator of autophagy e.g. in . As other examples autophagic vesicles can be imaged directly by electron microscopy e.g. TEM or a marker such as LC3 II can be assayed by immunoblotting immunoprecipitation or immunofluorescence see e.g. Tanida et al. 2008 LC3 and autophagy Methods Mol Bio 445 77 88 .

It will be evident that detection of expression activity post translational modification state or autophagy in the cell includes techniques that involve lysis of the cell and measurement e.g. in a cell lysate or extract as well as techniques that measure expression activity etc. directly in the cell without requiring extraction or lysis.

In any of the assays herein control compounds are optionally administered and the activity of the control compounds compared to those of the test compounds to verify that changes in activity resulting from application of the test compound are not artifacts. For example control compounds can include various dyes buffers adjuvants carriers or the like that the test compounds are typically administered with but lack a putative test compound.

Any of the assays herein are optionally performed in a high throughput fashion e.g. using automated fluid handling and or detection systems in a serial or parallel fashion.

Test compounds identified in cell based assays as modulators of a wwp 1 ubiquitination pathway parameter are then optionally further assayed e.g. for lifespan modulation in a whole organism assay as described below.

In another aspect the present invention provides screening assays in whole organisms. In a whole organism screening assay as in the cell based systems described above modulators for longevity or age related disease are identified. The methods typically include providing an organism for screening administering a test compound to the organism and assaying for a change in a relevant parameter due to the presence of the test compound. In certain exemplary embodiments expression of wwp 1 or ubc 18 has been altered in the animals employed while in other exemplary embodiments the animals exhibit wild type expression of wwp 1 and ubc 18.

One general class of embodiments provides methods of screening for a modulator of longevity in which a non human animal that exhibits artificially altered expression or activity of wwp 1 or a homolog thereof and or of ubc 18 or a homolog thereof is provided. A test compound is administered to the non human animal and a wwp 1 ubiquitination pathway parameter in the non human animal is assayed. A change in the wwp 1 ubiquitination pathway parameter indicates the test compound modulates longevity. Typically the change is observed e.g. relative to a control animal not receiving the test compound e.g. an isogenic or near isogenic animal of similar age or relative to the animal prior to administration of the compound.

As for the cell based screening embodiments above expression and activity can be altered using any of a wide variety of techniques known in the art e.g. through recombinant DNA techniques mutagenesis or the like.

In one class of embodiments the non human animal exhibits reduced expression or activity of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof and or reduced expression or activity of ubc 18 or the homolog thereof. For example expression or activity can be reduced by at least 50 at least 75 or at least 90 or can be undetectable. As just a few examples expression and or activity can be reduced using RNA interference or antisense techniques to decrease expression or through mutations e.g. point mutations insertions or deletions that decrease expression at an mRNA or protein level or that render the protein less active or inactive. In one embodiment the non human animal expresses a dominant negative form of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof or a dominant negative form of ubc 18 or the homolog thereof. Such animals exhibiting reduced expression or activity of wwp 1 or ubc 18 can be useful for example in screens for compounds that increase expression or activity of wwp 1 ubc 18 or a component downstream thereof.

In another class of embodiments the non human animal overexpresses wwp 1 or the homolog thereof and or ubc 18 or the homolog thereof. For example a transcript and or translated product can be present in the animal or selected cells thereof at an amount that is at least 2 at least 5 at least 10 at least 50 or even at least 100 normal for that animal or cell type including expression in an animal or cell not normally expressing the gene . In a related class of embodiments the animal expresses a constitutively active form of wwp 1 or ubc 18 for example wwp 1 with a mutation disrupting an inhibitory interaction between its WW and HECT domains.

In some embodiments the artificial alteration in expression provides a convenient way to assay the wwp 1 ubiquitination pathway parameter. For example the non human animal can express a recombinant reporter construct whose expression is easily monitored as described above. In one such embodiment the cell expresses a fusion protein comprising GFP or a homolog thereof and either wwp 1 or a homolog thereof or ubc 18 or a homolog thereof typically under control of an endogenous wwp 1 or ubc 18 or homologous promoter see e.g. the Examples section below. Changes in expression of wwp 1 or ubc 18 can thus be easily monitored by monitoring expression of the GFP moiety in the fusion protein. It will be evident that essentially any similar reporter can be substituted for GFP e.g. another fluorescent moiety a reporter enzyme an epitope tag etc. The reporter construct can replace the corresponding native gene or can be in addition to the native gene.

Suitable wwp 1 ubiquitination pathway parameters that can be assayed include but are not limited to one or more of lifespan e.g. mean or median lifespan an activity or expression level of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof an activity or expression level of ubc 18 or the homolog thereof an activity or expression level of pha 4 or a homolog thereof e.g. mammalian foxa1 foxa2 or foxa3 or another downstream factor e.g. a sod such as sod 1 sod 2 sod 4 or sod 5 post translational modification state of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof post translational modification state of a substrate of wwp 1 or ubc 18 or the homolog thereof and level of autophagy. Other parameters that can optionally be assayed include e.g. expression or activity level or post translational modification state of autophagy pathway members such as rab 10 TOR atg 1 vps 34 or bec 1 or a homolog thereof. Compounds that increase longevity or delay onset of age related diseases can be identified for example as those that increase lifespan of the non human animal increase expression of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof ubc 18 or the homolog thereof or pha 4 or the homolog thereof increase activity of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof ubc 18 or the homolog thereof or pha 4 or the homolog thereof increase phosphorylation of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof or increase ubiquitination of the substrate of wwp 1 or ubc 18 or the homolog thereof e.g. by at least 2 at least 5 at least 10 at least 50 or even at least 100 . Similarly compounds of interest can increase autophagy e.g. by at least 2 at least 5 at least 10 at least 50 or even at least 100 decrease expression or activity of rab 10 or TOR or the homolog thereof or increase expression or activity of atg 1 vps 34 or bec 1 or the homolog thereof.

Another general class of embodiments also provides methods of identifying a modulator of longevity. In these methods a non human animal is provided. A test compound is administered to the non human animal and expression or activity of wwp 1 or a homolog thereof expression or activity of ubc 18 or a homolog thereof and or post translational modification state of wwp 1 or a homolog thereof or a substrate thereof in the animal is monitored. A change e.g. an increase in expression or activity of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof a change e.g. an increase in expression or activity of ubc 18 or the homolog thereof altered e.g. increased phosphorylation of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof and or altered e.g. increased ubiquitination of the substrate indicates that the test compound modulates e.g. increases longevity. Typically the change is observed e.g. relative to a control animal not receiving the test compound e.g. an isogenic or near isogenic animal of similar age or relative to the animal prior to administration of the compound. Similarly other parameters related to the wwp 1 ubc 18 ubiquitin pathway or the autophagy pathway as described herein can be monitored.

As for the embodiments above the animals optionally express a reporter construct that facilitates measurement of expression or activity. For example the non human animal can express a fusion protein comprising GFP or a homolog thereof and either wwp 1 or a homolog thereof or ubc 18 or a homolog thereof. In such embodiments monitoring expression of wwp 1 or ubc 18 or the homolog thereof involves monitoring an optical signal from the GFP e.g. using a fluorescence microscope a fluorimeter a plate reader etc. whether manually or in an automated system in the animal or in explants cells or extracts therefrom .

Yet another general class of embodiments provides methods of screening for a modulator of longevity and or autophagy e.g. dietary restriction induced autophagy . In the methods a non human animal preferably that exhibits artificially altered expression or activity of wwp 1 or a homolog thereof and or of ubc 18 or a homolog thereof is provided. A test compound is administered to the non human animal and an autophagy pathway parameter in the non human animal is assayed. A change in the autophagy pathway parameter indicates the test compound modulates longevity and or autophagy. Typically the change is observed e.g. relative to a control animal not receiving the test compound e.g. an isogenic or near isogenic animal of similar age or relative to the animal prior to administration of the compound. Compounds of particular interest include those that increase autophagy decrease expression or activity of rab 10 or TOR including homologs thereof or increase expression or activity of atg 1 vps 34 bec 1 or pha 4 or a homolog of any thereof . Essentially all of the features for the embodiments above apply to these methods as well as relevant.

Suitable non human animals for use in the screens include vertebrates and invertebrates mammals and other animals. Preferred organisms for screening for longevity modulators are nematodes e.g. and flies e.g. as well as typical mammalian laboratory animals such as mice rabbits and rats. The organisms are optionally wild type organisms or transgenic animals as described herein. Typically the organisms express wwp 1 or a homolog or ortholog thereof ubc 18 or a homolog or ortholog thereof and or other gene s in the dietary restriction pathway. The animals optionally exhibit artificially altered expression of one two or more of wwp 1 ubc 18 and other genes that mediate dietary restriction induced longevity and or optionally exhibit artificially altered expression of or comprise mutations e.g. loss of function mutations in one or more genes in the insulin IGF 1 and or mitochondrial electron transport longevity pathways and or autophagy pathway.

Typically the animals are adult e.g. mature post development animals. For example screening can be performed in adult adult adult rodents etc. In one aspect the roundworm is used to assay for longevity modulators. is a simple soil nematode species that has been extensively described at the cellular and molecular level and is a model organism for biological studies. can develop through a normal life cycle that involves four larval stages and a final molt into an adult hermaphrodite. The dauer pathway is an alternative life cycle stage common to many nematode species which is normally triggered by environmental stresses such as starvation temperature extremes or overcrowding. Genetically the dauer pathway has been most intensively studied in . However in the present invention the dauer pathway is typically avoided and adult nematodes are used to avoid any interference between development pathways and longevity pathways.

As noted the organisms are administered a test compound e.g. a library of test compounds is administered to an array of organisms. Administration of the test compound is optionally by injection or by feeding the compound to the animal or any other mode of administration that is optionally used for pharmaceuticals. The animals are also optionally subjected to dietary restriction e.g. reduced caloric intake during the screen or the compounds can be tested without any dietary restrictions in place. It will be evident that the methods are frequently employed on populations of animals e.g. populations of isogenic or near isogenic animals for example the test compound can be administered to a population of animals and comparison made to a control population not receiving the compound.

The organisms are optionally observed to determine lifespan e.g. a mean or median lifespan. Lifespan assays have been well described in the art. See e.g. Apfeld J. Kenyon C. 1998 Cell 95 199 210 . In organisms that exhibit a modified lifespan an agent is identified based on its ability to either extend or shorten the lifespan.

Techniques for assaying expression activity post translational modification state and autophagy have been described above. Again it will be evident that detection of expression activity modification state or autophagy in the animal includes techniques that involve removal of tissue cells bodily fluid or the like from the animal and measurement e.g. in a cell or tissue lysate or extract as well as techniques that measure expression activity etc. directly in the animal without requiring extraction of a sample from the animal.

In any of the assays herein control compounds are optionally administered and the activity of the control compounds compared to those of the test compounds to verify that changes in activity resulting from application of the test compound are not artifacts. For example control compounds can include various dyes buffers adjuvants carriers or the like that the test compounds are typically administered with but lack a putative test compound.

Any of the assays herein are optionally performed in a high throughput fashion e.g. using automated fluid handling and or detection systems in a serial or parallel fashion.

After identification of a modulator additional assays are optionally conducted using the compound identified to further characterize the nature of the modulator s action with respect to longevity. For example further studies of lifespan can be conducted and a phenotype such as egg laying can be measured to determine whether the longevity occurs by delaying maturity. Compounds identified using the screening methods herein are then optionally used as the active ingredient in pharmaceuticals that extend lifespan e.g. to treat premature aging extend normal lifespan or delay onset of age related diseases.

High throughput methods of screening e.g. drug screening are particularly useful in identifying longevity modulators e.g. modulators that affect wwp 1 or ubc 18 polypeptide activity or gene expression. Generally in these methods a sample e.g. a cell free assay mixture a cell or a non human animal such as those described above is contacted with or administered a test compound typically one or more of a panel or library of compounds is contacted or administered to each of a plurality of samples. Modulation of a relevant parameter e.g. expression activity post translational modification binding autophagy or lifespan of the organism by the test compounds is detected thereby identifying one or more compound as a modulator or potential modulator. The assay methods of the present invention can be useful in performing high throughput e.g. greater than 1 000 compounds day and even ultra high throughput e.g. greater than 10 000 compounds day screening of chemical libraries e.g. searching for modulators of longevity. These experiments may be carried out in parallel by a providing a large number of samples e.g. reaction mixtures cell suspensions or organisms in separate receptacles typically in a multiwell or similar format e.g. 96 well 324 well or 1536 well plates. Different test compounds library members are added to separate wells and the effect of the compound on the sample is ascertained e.g. via lifespan determination detection of expression activity post translational modification autophagy or binding as described above. These parallel assays are generally carried out using specialized equipment to enable simultaneous processing of large numbers of samples i.e. fluid handling by robotic pipettor systems and detection in multiplexed systems.

Automated systems of the invention can facilitate the screening methods described above both in vitro and in vivo screening methods . That is systems that facilitate cell free cell based or whole organism based screening for modulators of longevity or onset of age related diseases are a feature of the invention. Similarly systems designed to monitor physiological responses of animals including non human transgenic laboratory animals are also a feature of the invention. System features herein are generally applicable to the methods herein and vice versa.

Systems e.g. high throughput automated systems to identify modulators of longevity or age related disease typically include an array of samples e.g. any in vitro assay mixture cell or animal described herein. For example the system can include an array of non human animals cells or in vitro assay mixtures in containers e.g. multiwell plates tubes etc. . A source of a plurality of test compounds is also typically included in such a system. A monitoring module e.g. including a detector monitors a relevant parameter in the samples e.g. after contact with a test compound and detects any changes in the parameter and a correlation module e.g. a computer correlates any changes that occur with longevity modulation and the particular compound that initiated such change.

For example one class of embodiments provides a system for screening for compounds that modulate longevity in which an array of non human animals in containers e.g. vials tubes boxes cages etc. as appropriate for the type of animal is provided. The non human animals exhibit artificially altered expression or activity of wwp 1 or a homolog thereof and or of ubc 18 or a homolog thereof. The system also includes a monitoring module and a correlation module. After the animals are exposed to e.g. injected or fed one or more test compounds the monitoring module is used to monitor a wwp 1 ubiquitination pathway parameter of the non human animals in the array e.g. used to determine lifespan or to detect an activity or expression level of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof ubc 18 or the homolog thereof or pha 4 or a homolog thereof post translational modification state of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof or a substrate thereof or level of autophagy . The correlation module is then used to correlate a change in the wwp 1 ubiquitination pathway parameter e.g. relative to an untreated animal to longevity thereby identifying any test compounds that modulate longevity.

Another exemplary class of embodiments also provides a system for screening for compounds that modulate longevity. In this class of embodiments the system includes an array of non human animals in containers a monitoring module and a correlation module. The monitoring module monitors expression or activity of wwp 1 or a homolog thereof expression or activity of ubc 18 or a homolog thereof and or post translational modification state of wwp 1 or a homolog thereof or a substrate thereof in the non human animals in the array following administration of a test compound. The correlation module then correlates a change e.g. an increase in expression or activity of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof a change e.g. an increase in expression or activity of ubc 18 or the homolog thereof altered e.g. increased phosphorylation of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof and or altered e.g. increased ubiquitination of the substrate e.g. relative to an untreated animal to longevity thereby identifying the compounds that modulate longevity. Similarly other parameters related to the wwp 1 ubc 18 ubiquitin pathway or the autophagy pathway as described herein can be monitored.

The non human animals can be essentially any of those described herein as appropriate for example wild type animals animals exhibiting reduced expression or activity of wwp 1 or a homolog thereof and or reduced expression or activity of ubc 18 or a homolog thereof animals that overexpress wwp 1 or a homolog thereof and or ubc 18 or a homolog thereof or animals expressing recombinant reporter constructs. Similarly the non human animals can be nematodes e.g. flies e.g. rodents etc. Typically the animals are adults. The animals whose phenotype is to be analyzed are optionally part of the system or they can be considered separate from it.

Arrays of the invention can be standard gridded arrays that have a logical spatial relationship among members of the array e.g. in multiwell plates or vials of in a rack. The array can also be a logical array in which the members of the array are linked by a look up table that tracks array members such as individual wells or vials. In the latter series of embodiments standard tracking software can be used to track well or vial positions and different logical arrays e.g. sets of wells or vials can be treated with one or more different modulators. In the case where the arrays are arranged in a standard spatial arrangement the entire array or selected members can be treated with one or more modulators and the effects observed.

Essentially any available compound library can be screened e.g. in a high throughput format in the systems herein. A number of suitable test compounds and libraries thereof have been noted above. Additional libraries exist many of which are commercially available e.g. from Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. Actimol Newark Del. providing e.g. the Actiprobe 10 and Actiprobe 25 libraries of 10 000 and 25 000 compounds respectively BioMol Philadelphia Pa. providing a variety of libraries including natural compound libraries and the SCREEN WELL Ion Channel ligand library as well as several other application specific libraries Enamine Kiev Ukranie which produces custom libraries of billions of compounds from thousands of different building blocks TimTec Newark Delaware which produces general screening stock compound libraries containing 100 000 compounds as well as template based libraries with common heterocyclic lattices libraries for targeted mechanism based selections including kinase modulators GPCR ligands channel modulators etc. privileged structure libraries that include compounds containing chemical motifs that are more frequently associated with higher biological activity than other structures diversity libraries that include compounds pre selected from available stocks of compounds with maximum chemical diversity plant extract libraries natural products and natural product derived libraries etc AnalytiCon Discovery Germany including NatDiverse natural product analogue screening compounds and MEGAbolite natural product screening compounds Chembridge San Diego Calif. including a wide array of targeted or general and custom or stock libraries ChemDiv San Diego Calif. providing a variety of compound diversity libraries including CombiLab and the International Diversity Collection Comgenix Hungary including ACTIVERSE libraries MicroSource Gaylordsville Conn. including natural libraries agro libraries the NINDS custom library the genesis plus library and others Polyphor Switzerland including privileged core structures as well as novel scaffolds Prestwick Chemical Washington D.C. including the Prestwick chemical collection and others that are pre screened for biotolerance Tripos St. Louis Mo. including large lead screening libraries and many others. Academic institutions such as the Zelinsky Institute of Organic Chemistry Russia also provide libraries of considerable structural diversity that can be screened in the methods of the invention e.g. to find longevity modulators.

The format of the library will vary depending on the system to be used. In one typical embodiment libraries of test compounds and or sample materials are arrayed in microwell plates e.g. 96 384 or more well plates which can be accessed by standard fluid handling robotics e.g. using a pipettor or other fluid handler with a standard ORCA robot Optimized Robot for Chemical Analysis available from Beckman Coulter Fullerton Calif. . Standard commercially available workstations such as the Caliper Life Sciences Hopkinton Mass. Sciclone ALH 3000 workstation and RAPIDPLATE 96 384 workstation provide precise 96 and 384 well fluid transfers in a small highly scalable format. Plate management systems such as the Caliper Life Sciences TWISTER II Advanced Capability Microplate Handler for End Users OEM s and Integrators provide plate handling storage and management capabilities for fluid handling while the PRESTO AutoStack provides fast reliable access to consumables presenting trays of tips reagents microplates or deep wells to an automated device e.g. the ALH 3000 without robotic arm intervention.

Microfluidic systems for handling and analyzing microscale fluid samples e.g. in cell based and non cell based approaches that can be used for analysis of test compounds on biological samples in the present invention are also available e.g. the Caliper Life Sciences various LABCHIP technologies e.g. LABCHIP 90 and 3000 and Agilent Technologies Palo Alto Calif. 2100 and 5100 devices. Similarly interface devices between microfluidic and standard plate handling technologies are also commercially available. For example the Caliper Technologies LABCHIP 3000 uses sipper chips as a chip to world interface that allows automated sampling from microtiter plates. To meet the needs of high throughput environments the LABCHIP 3000 employs four or even twelve sippers on a single chip so that samples can be processed in parallel up to twelve at a time. Solid phase libraries of materials can also be conveniently accessed using sipper or pipetting technology e.g. solid phase libraries can be gridded on a surface and dried for later rehydration with a sipper or pipette and accessed through the sipper or pipette. These sources are optionally used with whole organism cell based and or cell free screening systems. For example a library of test compounds in a microtiter plate can be accessed via a sipper or pipettor device into an array of containers or microchannels containing cells or organisms for screening as described above.

Although the devices and systems specifically illustrated herein are generally described in terms of the performance of a few or one particular operation it will be readily appreciated from this disclosure that these systems permit easy integration of additional operations. For example the systems described will optionally include structures reagents and systems for performing virtually any number of operations both upstream and downstream from the operations specifically described herein. Such upstream operations include sample handling and preparation operations e.g. cell separation extraction purification culture amplification cellular activation labeling reactions dilution aliquotting and the like. Similarly downstream operations may include similar operations including e.g. separation of sample components labeling of components assays and detection operations movement of components into contact with cells or organisms or the like.

Upstream and downstream assay and detection operations include without limitation fluorescence assays activity assays receptor ligand assays immunoassays nucleic acid amplification binding assays lifespan determination and the like. Any of these elements can be incorporated into the systems herein.

In general in the present invention materials such as cells and organisms are optionally monitored and or detected so that lifespan or expression activity or post translational modification can be determined. Depending on the measurement made decisions can be made regarding subsequent operations e.g. whether to further assay a particular modulator in detail to determine the extent of lifespan modulation such as whether diet restriction is necessary for the modulator to work and whether the modulator also delays onset of age related diseases.

The systems described herein generally include fluid handling devices as described above in conjunction with additional instrumentation for controlling fluid transport flow rate and direction within the devices detection instrumentation for detecting or sensing results of the operations performed by the system processors e.g. computers for instructing the controlling instrumentation in accordance with preprogrammed instructions receiving data from the detection instrumentation and for analyzing storing and interpreting the data and providing the data and interpretations in a readily accessible reporting format.

A variety of controlling instrumentation is optionally utilized in conjunction with the fluid handling elements described above for controlling the transport and direction of fluids and or materials samples reaction mixtures cells test compounds etc. within the systems of the present invention. Controllers typically include appropriate software to direct fluid and material transport in response to user instructions. For example software that directs the amount of nutrition food to be fed to an array of nematodes can be included in a system of the present invention to allow a user to alter the dietary restriction profile for an array of nematodes being screened. Software that allows a user to direct a particular RNAi molecule to be administered to a cell or organism allows a user to selectively knock out a gene such as wwp 1 and or ubc 18 when screening for longevity modulators.

Typically the controller systems are appropriately configured to receive or interface with a fluid handling or other system element as described herein. For example the controller and or detector optionally includes a stage upon which a sample is mounted to facilitate appropriate interfacing between the controller and or detector and the rest of the system. Typically the stage includes an appropriate mounting alignment structural elements such as a nesting well alignment pins and or holes asymmetric edge structures e.g. to facilitate proper alignment of slides microwell plates or microfluidic chips and the like.

Within the systems of the invention detectors can take any of a variety of forms. The various fluid handling stations noted above often come with integrated detectors e.g. optical or fluorescent detectors. However other detectors such as one that measures lifespan are also optionally used.

System signal detectors are typically disposed adjacent to a site of reaction or mixing between a cell sample or organism and a test compound. This site can be a test tube microwell plate microfluidic device or the like. The site is within sensory communication of the detector. The phrase within sensory communication generally refers to the relative location of the detector that is positioned relative to the site so as to be able to receive a particular relevant signal from that container. In the case of optical detectors e.g. fluorescence FRET or fluorescence polarization detectors sensory communication typically means that the detector is disposed sufficiently proximal to the container that optical e.g. fluorescent signals are transmitted to the detector for adequate detection of those signals. Typically this employs a lens optical train or other detection element e.g. a CCD that is focused upon a relevant portion of the container to efficiently gather and record these optical signals.

Exemplary detectors include but are not limited to photo multiplier tubes a spectrophotometer a fluorimeter a CCD array a scanning detector a microscope or the like. Cells dyes or other components which emit a detectable signal can be flowed past or moved into contact with the detector or alternatively the detector can move relative to an array of samples or the detector can simultaneously monitor a number of spatial positions corresponding to samples e.g. as in a CCD array . For example a microscope is optionally moved relative to an array of nematodes in containers e.g. to determine whether the organism in a particular container is alive at any given time point.

The system typically includes a signal detector located proximal to the site of mixing reaction. The signal detector detects the detectable signal e.g. for a selected length of time. For example the detector can include a spectrophotometer or other optical detection element. Commonly the signal detector is operably coupled to a computer which deconvolves the detectable signal to provide an indication of a relevant parameter such as lifespan protein activity gene expression etc. Changes in the relevant parameter s are monitored in response to a test compound e.g. putative modulator e.g. as compared to a control that does not include the test compound.

The system typically includes e.g. in the correlation module e.g. in a processor or computer system instructions that correlate a relevant parameter with a predicted longevity phenotype e.g. instructions that correlate gene expression protein activity protein post translational modification level or lifespan with increased or decreased longevity. The system instructions can compare detected information as to the parameter with a database that includes correlations between values of the parameter and the relevant phenotypes. This database can be multidimensional thereby including higher order relationships between combinations of parameters or other information and the relevant phenotypes. These relationships can be stored in any number of look up tables e.g. taking the form of spreadsheets e.g. EXCEL spreadsheets or databases such as an ACCESS SQL ORACLE PARADOX or similar database. The system can include provisions for inputting animal specific information regarding parameter information e.g. through an automated or user interface and for comparing that information to the look up tables.

The correlation module can include software that tracks and analyzes data relationships. For example Partek Incorporated St. Peters Missouri www dot partek dot com provides software for pattern recognition e.g. Partek Pro 2000 Pattern Recognition Software which can be applied to e.g. principle component analysis genetic algorithms for multivariate data analysis interactive visualization variable selection and neural and statistical modeling. Relationships can be analyzed e.g. by principal components analysis mapped scatterplots and biplots multi dimensional scaling mapped scatterplots Star plots etc. The software of the system can be heuristic in nature e.g. by including neural networks or statistical methods to detect and analyze data relationships. For example neural net approaches can be coupled to genetic algorithm type programming for heuristic development of a modulator trait data space model. For example NNUGA Neural Network Using Genetic Algorithms is an available program e.g. on the world wide web at cs dot bgu dot ac dot il omri NNUGA which couples neural networks and genetic algorithms. An introduction to neural networks can be found e.g. in Kevin Gurney 1999 UCL Press 1 Gunpowder Square London EC4A 3DE UK. and on the world wide web at shef dot ac dot uk psychology gurney notes index dot html. Additional useful neural network references include e.g. Christopher M. Bishop 1995 Oxford Univ Press ISBN 0198538642 Brian D. Ripley N. L. Hjort Contributor 1995 Cambridge University Press Short ISBN 0521460867. The correlation module can include any available statistical tool for detecting correlating predicting or analyzing modulator data including multidimensional data as noted above.

For example the system instructions can include software that accepts information associated with any detected parameter information e.g. an indication that a subject with the relevant parameter value has a particular phenotype. This software can be heuristic in nature using such inputted associations to detect correlations or to improve the accuracy of the look up tables and or interpretation of the look up tables by the system. A variety of such approaches including principle component analysis neural networks genetic algorithms Markov modeling and other statistical analysis are known in the art and can be incorporated into the system software.

Also in screening systems of the invention either or both of the controller system and or the detection system are optionally coupled to an appropriately programmed processor or computer which functions to instruct the operation of these instruments in accordance with preprogrammed or user input instructions receive data and information from these instruments and interpret manipulate and report this information to the user. As such the computer is typically appropriately coupled to one or both of these instruments e.g. including an analog to digital or digital to analog converter as needed .

The computer typically includes appropriate software for receiving user instructions either in the form of user input into a set parameter fields or in the form of preprogrammed instructions e.g. preprogrammed for a variety of different specific operations. For example a user may input the amount of nutrients a nematode is to receive or the wwp 1 ubiquitination pathway parameter that is to be measured. The software then converts these instructions to appropriate language for instructing e.g. the operation of the fluid direction and transport controller to carry out further desired operations. The computer then receives the data from the one or more sensors detectors included within the system and interprets the data either provides it in a user understood format or uses that data to initiate further controller instructions in accordance with the programming e.g. such as in monitoring and control of flow rates temperatures further assays and the like. For example the computer correlates which test compounds were capable of binding to wwp 1 or ubc 18 a kinase a phosphatase etc. in a cell free assay and then selects and initiates instruction that those compounds be used in cell based assays that measure expression or activity levels or whole organism assays that measure lifespan.

Optionally system components for interfacing with a user are provided. For example the systems can include a user viewable display for viewing an output of computer implemented system instructions user input devices e.g. keyboards or pointing devices such as a mouse for inputting user commands and activating the system etc. Typically the system of interest includes a computer wherein the various computer implemented system instructions are embodied in computer software e.g. stored on computer readable media.

In addition to statistical software standard desktop applications such as word processing software e.g. MICROSOFT WORD or COREL WORDPERFECT and database software e.g. spreadsheet software such as MICROSOFT EXCEL COREL QUATTRO PRO or database programs such as MICROSOFT ACCESS or SEQUEL ORACLE PARADOX can be adapted to the present invention by inputting a character string corresponding to a modulator a behavior or other trait herein or to an association between a modulator or parameter or other trait and a phenotype. Suitable software can also easily be constructed by one of skill using a standard programming language such as Visualbasic Fortran Basic Java or the like.

As noted systems can include a computer with an appropriate database and a behavior or correlation of the invention. Data sets entered into the software system comprising any of the wwp 1 ubiquitination pathway parameters or parameter phenotype correlations herein can be a feature of the invention. The computer can be e.g. a PC Intel x86 or Pentium chip compatible DOS OS2 WINDOWS WINDOWS NT WINDOWS95 WINDOWS98 WINDOWS2000 WINDOWSME WINDOWS VISTA or LINUX based machine a MACINTOSH Power PC or a UNIX based e.g. SUN work station or LINUX based machine or other commercially common computer which is known to one of skill.

Biosensors of the invention are devices or systems that comprise the polypeptides or nucleic acids of the invention e.g. a wwp 1 or ubc 18 polypeptide or nucleic acid coupled to a readout that measures or displays one or more activity of the polypeptide or nucleic acid. Thus any of the above described assay components can be configured as a biosensor by operably coupling the appropriate assay components to a readout. The readout can be optical e.g. to detect cell markers ion sensitive dyes cell potential or cell survival electrical e.g. coupled to a FET a BIAcore or any of a variety of others spectrographic or the like and can optionally include a user viewable display e.g. a CRT or optical viewing station . The biosensor can be coupled to robotics or other automation e.g. microfluidic systems that direct contact of the test compounds to the proteins of the invention e.g. for automated high throughput analysis of test compound activity. A large variety of automated systems that can be adapted to use with the biosensors of the invention are commercially available. For example automated systems have been made to assess a variety of biological phenomena including e.g. expression levels of genes in response to selected stimuli Service 1998 Microchips Arrays Put DNA on the Spot 282 396 399 . Laboratory systems can also perform e.g. repetitive fluid handling operations e.g. pipetting for transferring material to or from reagent storage systems that comprise arrays such as microtiter trays or other chip trays which are used as basic container elements for a variety of automated laboratory methods. Similarly the systems manipulate e.g. microtiter trays and control a variety of environmental conditions such as temperature exposure to light or air and the like. Many such automated systems are commercially available. Examples of automated systems are available from Caliper Technologies including the former Zymark Corporation Hopkinton Mass. which utilize various Zymate systems that typically include e.g. robotics and fluid handling modules. Similarly the common ORCA robot which is used in a variety of laboratory systems e.g. for microtiter tray manipulation is also commercially available e.g. from Beckman Coulter Inc. Fullerton Calif. . A number of automated approaches to high throughput activity screening are provided by the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Foundation La Jolla Calif. See GNF.org on the world wide web. Microfluidic screening applications are also commercially available from Caliper Technologies Corp. For example e.g. LABMICROFLUIDIC DEVICE high throughput screening system HTS by Caliper Technologies Mountain View Calif. or the HP Agilent technologies Bioanalyzer using LABCHIP technology by Caliper Technologies Corp. can be adapted for use in the present invention.

In an alternate embodiment conformational changes are detected by coupling the polypeptides or complexes of the invention to an electrical readout e.g. to a chemically coupled field effect transistor a CHEM FET or other appropriate system for detecting changes in conductance or other electrical properties brought about by a conformational shift by the protein of the invention e.g. by binding of a test compound to a polypeptide or gene of the invention.

Compounds identified as described above or any other compounds that modulate longevity e.g. through the dietary restriction pathway based on wwp 1 and ubc 18 are another feature of the invention. The compounds of the invention are typically administered to a subject or patient e.g. to increase longevity to treat premature aging delay the onset of age related diseases such as some cancers or enhance quality of life during the later part of a subject s lifespan e.g. by preventing or alleviating symptoms of aging such as cognitive and motor deficits. The subject is optionally treated once with a compound that acts over an extended period of time or given daily weekly or monthly doses or the like for a shorter acting compound. In addition a subject can be subjected to dietary restriction while on a pharmaceutical dosing regimen to extend longevity or the compound used can act in the absence of any dietary restrictions.

In one aspect the invention provides methods for modulating e.g. increasing longevity of an animal. In the methods expression or activity of wwp 1 or a homolog thereof and or of ubc 18 or a homolog thereof in the animal is modulated e.g. increased e.g. relative to a control or untreated animal. For example expression of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof activity of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof phosphorylation of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof or expression or activity of ubc 18 or the homolog thereof can be increased.

Modulation can be effected for example by administration of a longevity modulator that affects wwp 1 or the homolog thereof or ubc 18 or the homolog thereof by overexpression or inhibition of expression of wwp 1 and or ubc 18 or similar techniques. Exemplary modulators have been described herein and include for example compounds that increase expression of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof compounds that increase activity of wwp 1 or the homolog thereof e.g. by decreasing expression or activity of a phosphatase that dephosphorylates wwp 1 or the homolog thereof or by increasing expression or activity of a kinase that phosphorylates wwp 1 or the homolog thereof and compounds that increase expression or activity of ubc 18 or the homolog thereof. Modulation can be e.g. relative to the animal before such treatment or relative to a control untreated animal.

The animal can be a human or it can be a non human animal. The animal is optionally also subjected to dietary restriction.

A related aspect provides methods of delaying onset of an age related disease such as cancer diabetes a cardiovascular disease or a neurodegenerative disease in an animal. In these methods expression or activity of wwp 1 or a homolog thereof and or of ubc 18 or a homolog thereof in the animal is modulated e.g. increased or decreased e.g. relative to a control or untreated animal. As for the embodiments above modulation can be effected e.g. by administration of a longevity modulator that affects wwp 1 or the homolog thereof or ubc 18 or the homolog thereof. The animal can be a human or it can be a non human animal. The animal is optionally also subjected to dietary restriction.

Given that human wwp1 is a potential oncogene shown to be amplified in breast and prostate cancers Chen et al. 2007 The amplified WWP1 gene is a potential molecular target in breast cancer Int J. Cancer. 121 1 80 87 and Chen et al. 2007 Ubiquitin E3 ligase WWP1 as an oncogenic factor in human prostate cancer Oncogene 26 16 2386 94 and that wwp1 and itch negatively regulate tumor suppressor p53 and its paralog p73 Laine and Ronai 2007 Regulation of p53 localization and transcription by the HECT domain E3 ligase WWP1 Oncogene 26 10 1477 83 in embodiments in which human wwp1 is activated or overexpressed such activation or overexpression is preferably accomplished in adults in differentiated or post mitotic cells and the subject is closely monitored for undesirable side effects. For embodiments in which downregulation of wwp1 is desired e.g. such cancers inhibitors of wwp1 expression or activity identified as described herein are useful therapeutics.

Various aspects of the invention involve administration of a modulator to a human patient or non human animal. In embodiments in which a modulator is administered particularly to a human for example to treat an age related disease or disorder or increase longevity compositions for administration typically comprise a therapeutically effective amount of the modulator i.e. an amount that is effective for preventing ameliorating delaying onset of or treating a disease or disorder preventing or ameliorating physiological effects of aging extending lifespan or the like and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Such a carrier or excipient includes but is not limited to saline buffered saline dextrose water glycerol ethanol and or combinations thereof. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are determined in part by the particular composition being administered as well as by the particular method used to administer the composition. Accordingly there is a wide variety of suitable formulations of pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention.

Therapeutic compositions comprising one or more modulators of the invention are optionally tested in one or more appropriate in vitro and or in vivo animal model of disease to confirm efficacy tissue metabolism and to estimate dosages according to methods well known in the art. In particular dosages can initially be determined by activity stability or other suitable measures of the formulation.

Compositions can be administered by a number of routes including but not limited to oral intravenous intraperitoneal intramuscular transdermal subcutaneous topical sublingual or rectal administration. Such administration routes and appropriate formulations are generally known to those of skill in the art.

The compositions alone or in combination with other suitable components can also be made into aerosol formulations i.e. they can be nebulized to be administered via inhalation. Aerosol formulations can be placed into pressurized acceptable propellants such as dichlorodifluoromethane propane nitrogen and the like. Formulations suitable for parenteral administration such as for example by intraarticular in the joints intravenous intramuscular intradermal intraperitoneal and subcutaneous routes include aqueous and non aqueous isotonic sterile injection solutions which can contain antioxidants buffers bacteriostats and solutes that render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient and aqueous and non aqueous sterile suspensions that can include suspending agents solubilizers thickening agents stabilizers and preservatives. The formulations can be presented in unit dose or multi dose sealed containers such as ampules and vials.

For longevity extension or prevention or treatment of disease the appropriate dosage of a modulator e.g. identified by the methods provided herein will depend on the type of disease to be treated e.g. premature aging or extension of lifespan in a mature adult the severity and course of the disease whether the modulator is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes previous therapy the patient s clinical history and the discretion of the attending physician. The compound or combination of compounds is suitably administered to the patient in one dose or more typically over a series of treatments.

The dose administered to a patient in the context of the present invention is sufficient to effect a beneficial e.g. prophylactic and or therapeutic response in the patient over time. The dose is determined e.g. by the efficacy of the particular compound or other formulation and the condition of the patient as well as the body weight or surface area of the patient to be treated. The size of the dose is also determined by the existence nature and extent of any adverse side effects that accompany the administration of a particular formulation in a particular patient. In determining the effective amount of the modulator or formulation to be administered in the treatment of disease or extension of lifespan the physician evaluates such factors as circulating plasma levels of the modulator formulation toxicities and progression of any relevant disease.

For administration formulations of the present invention are optionally administered at a rate determined by the LD 50 of the relevant formulation and or observation of any side effects of the modulators of the invention at various concentrations e.g. as applied to the mass or topical delivery area and overall health of the patient. As will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art the appropriate doses of compounds of the invention e.g. polypeptides antisense RNAi molecules antibodies drugs etc. will be generally around those already employed in clinical therapies wherein similar moieties are administered alone or in combination with other therapeutics. The physician administering treatment will be able to determine the appropriate dose for the individual subject. The progress of the therapy of the invention is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays the efficacy of a therapeutic method of the invention over time can be identified by an absence of symptoms or clinical signs e.g. by delayed onset of age related conditions and by lifespan extension e.g. beyond an average age for a particular population.

If a patient undergoing treatment develops fevers chills or muscle aches he she receives the appropriate dose of aspirin ibuprofen acetaminophen or other pain fever controlling drug. Patients who experience reactions to the compositions such as fever muscle aches and chills are premedicated 30 minutes prior to the future infusions with either aspirin acetaminophen or e.g. diphenhydramine. Meperidine is used for more severe chills and muscle aches that do not quickly respond to antipyretics and antihistamines. Treatment is slowed or discontinued depending upon the severity of the reaction.

Another aspect of the invention is gene therapy to extend longevity e.g. in human or veterinary subjects. In these applications the nucleic acids of the invention are optionally cloned into appropriate gene therapy vectors and or are simply delivered as naked or liposome conjugated nucleic acids which are then delivered optionally in combination with appropriate carriers or delivery agents. Proteins can also be delivered directly but delivery of the nucleic acid is typically preferred in applications where stable expression is desired.

Vectors for administration typically comprise wwp 1 and or ubc 18 genes under the control of a promoter that is expressed in a cell of interest. These can include native wwp 1 and or ubc 18 promoters and or upstream regulatory elements or other cell specific promoters known to those of skill in the art. Compositions for administration typically comprise a therapeutically effective amount of the gene therapy vector or other relevant nucleic acid and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient and are formulated to suit the mode of administration. Administration is by any of the routes normally used for introducing a molecule into ultimate contact with cells of interest. Practitioners can select an administration route of interest based on the cell target. Suitable methods of administering such nucleic acids are available and known to those of skill in the art.

The dose administered to a patient in the context of the present invention is sufficient to effect a beneficial therapeutic response in the patient over time e.g. extension of lifespan or a halt or delay in the progression of age related diseases. The dose is determined by the efficacy of the particular vector or other formulation the activity stability or serum half life of the polypeptide which is expressed and the condition of the patient as well as the body weight or surface area of the patient to be treated. The size of the dose is also determined by the existence nature and extent of any adverse side effects that accompany the administration of a particular vector formulation or the like in a particular patient. In determining the effective amount of the vector or formulation to be administered in the treatment of disease a physician evaluates local expression in the tissue or cell of interest or circulating plasma levels formulation toxicities progression of the relevant disease and or where relevant the production of antibodies to proteins encoded by the polynucleotides. The dose administered is typically in the range equivalent to dosages of currently used therapeutic proteins adjusted for the altered activity or serum half life of the relevant composition. The vectors of this invention can supplement treatment conditions by any known conventional therapy e.g. diet restriction.

In other embodiments the invention provides a kit useful for the methods and modulators described herein. Such kits optionally comprise one or more containers labels and instructions as well as components for assaying and identifying potential modulators of the dietary restriction pathway. For example a kit optionally contains an array of nematodes in containers along with a module for assaying lifespan of the nematodes when exposed to various test compounds.

In many embodiments the kits comprise instructions typically written instructions relating to the use of the kit to identify longevity modulators. In some embodiments the kits comprise a URL address or phone number or the like for users to contact for instructions or further instructions.

In practicing the present invention many conventional techniques in molecular biology microbiology and recombinant DNA technology are optionally used. These techniques are well known and are explained in for example Berger and Kimmel 152 Academic Press Inc. San Diego Calif. Sambrook et al. 3rd Ed.

Other useful references e.g. for cell isolation and culture include Freshney 1994 third edition Wiley Liss New York and the references cited therein and Atlas and Parks Eds. 1993 CRC Press Boca Raton Fla.

Methods of making nucleic acids e.g. by in vitro amplification purification from cells or chemical synthesis methods for manipulating nucleic acids e.g. site directed mutagenesis by restriction enzyme digestion ligation etc. and various vectors promoters cell lines and the like useful in manipulating and making nucleic acids and polypeptides are described in the above references. For example common vectors include e.g. plasmids cosmids viruses YACs etc. and typically have one or more origins of replication one or more sites into which recombinant DNA can be conveniently inserted and one or more selectable markers for selecting cells containing vectors from those without. Expression vectors comprising elements that provide for or facilitate transcription of nucleic acids which are cloned into the vectors are also widely available such elements include e.g. transcription and translation terminators transcription and translation initiation sequences and promoters and or enhancers useful for regulation of the expression of the particular target nucleic acid. A plethora of kits are commercially available for the preparation purification and cloning of plasmids or other relevant nucleic acids from cells e.g. STRATACLEAN from Stratagene and QIAPREP from Qiagen. Any isolated and or purified nucleic acid can be further manipulated to produce other nucleic acids used to transfect cells incorporated into related vectors to infect organisms or the like.

Expression e.g. transcription and or translation of wwp 1 ubc 18 or other genes of interest can be altered using any of a variety of techniques known in the art as noted above. For example gene expression can be inhibited in cells or organisms using an antisense nucleic acid or an interfering RNA RNAi e.g. to decrease or knock out expression of wwp 1 and or ubc 18 see e.g. the Examples section herein. Similarly genes can be overexpressed or heterologously expressed in transgenic organisms or cells. Other methods for reducing or eliminating expression or activity e.g. by inducing artificial mutations e.g. point deletion or insertion mutations in a gene and screening for individuals with the desired loss of expression or activity or the like are also well known in the art. See e.g. the references herein.

Inhibition of expression in cells organisms or particular cell types can be used for further studying the in vitro or in vivo role of these genes as a mechanism for treating a condition caused by overexpression of a wwp 1 or ubc 18 gene or for treating a dominant effect caused by a particular allele of such a gene. In a particularly useful aspect expression of wwp 1 and or ubc 18 is optionally altered e.g. reduced silenced or increased or altered by expression of a reporter construct in cells or organisms used for screening for longevity modulators in the present invention.

Use of antisense nucleic acids is well known in the art. An antisense nucleic acid has a region of complementarity to a target nucleic acid e.g. a target gene mRNA or cDNA. Typically a nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence in a complementary antisense orientation with respect to a coding sense sequence of an endogenous gene is introduced into a cell. The antisense nucleic acid can be RNA DNA a PNA or any other appropriate molecule. Antisense oligomers are typically at least about 15 to at least about 50 nucleotides. A duplex forms between the antisense sequence and its complementary sense sequence resulting in inactivation of the gene. The antisense nucleic acid can inhibit gene expression by forming a duplex with an RNA transcribed from the gene by forming a triplex with duplex DNA etc. An antisense nucleic acid can be produced e.g. for any gene whose coding sequence is known or can be determined by a number of well established techniques e.g. chemical synthesis of an antisense RNA or oligonucleotide optionally including modified nucleotides and or linkages that increase resistance to degradation or improve cellular uptake or in vitro transcription . Antisense nucleic acids and their use are described e.g. in U.S. Pat. No. 6 242 258 to Haselton and Alexander Jun. 5 2001 entitled Methods for the selective regulation of DNA and RNA transcription and translation by photoactivation U.S. Pat.

Eckstein Ed. 1991 IRL Press.

Gene expression can also be inhibited by RNA silencing or interference. RNA silencing refers to any mechanism through which the presence of a single stranded or typically a double stranded RNA in a cell or organism results in inhibition of expression of a target gene comprising a sequence identical or nearly identical to that of the RNA including but not limited to RNA interference repression of translation of a target mRNA transcribed from the target gene without alteration of the mRNA s stability and transcriptional silencing e.g. histone acetylation and heterochromatin formation leading to inhibition of transcription of the target mRNA .

The term RNA interference RNAi sometimes called RNA mediated interference post transcriptional gene silencing or quelling refers to a phenomenon in which the presence of RNA typically double stranded RNA in a cell or organism results in inhibition of expression of a gene comprising a sequence identical or nearly identical to that of the double stranded RNA. The double stranded RNA responsible for inducing RNAi is called an interfering RNA . Expression of the gene is inhibited by the mechanism of RNAi as described below in which the presence of the interfering RNA results in degradation of mRNA transcribed from the gene and thus in decreased levels of the mRNA and any encoded protein.

The mechanism of RNAi has been and is being extensively investigated in a number of eukaryotic organisms and cell types. See for example the following reviews McManus and Sharp 2002 Gene silencing in mammals by small interfering RNAs Nature Reviews Genetics 3 737 747 Hutvagner and Zamore 2002 RNAi Nature abhors a double strand Curr Opin Genet Dev 200 225 232 Hannon 2002 RNA interference Nature 418 244 251 Agami 2002 RNAi and related mechanisms and their potential use for therapy Curr Opin Chem Biol 6 829 834 Tuschl and Borkhardt 2002 Small interfering RNAs A revolutionary tool for the analysis of gene function and gene therapy Molecular Interventions 2 158 167 Nishikura 2001 A short primer on RNAi RNA directed RNA polymerase acts as a key catalyst Cell 107 415 418 and Zamore 2001 RNA interference Listening to the sound of silence Nature Structural Biology 8 746 750. RNAi is also described in the patent literature see e.g. CA 2359180 by Kreutzer and Limmer entitled Method and medicament for inhibiting the expression of a given gene WO 01 68836 by Beach et al. entitled Methods and compositions for RNA interference WO 01 70949 by Graham et al. entitled Genetic silencing and WO 01 75164 by Tuschl et al. entitled RNA sequence specific mediators of RNA interference .

In brief double stranded RNA introduced into a cell e.g. into the cytoplasm is processed for example by an RNAse III like enzyme called Dicer into shorter double stranded fragments called small interfering RNAs siRNAs also called short interfering RNAs . The length and nature of the siRNAs produced is dependent on the species of the cell although typically siRNAs are 21 25 nucleotides long e.g. an siRNA may have a 19 base pair duplex portion with two nucleotide 3 overhangs at each end . Similar siRNAs can be produced in vitro e.g. by chemical synthesis or in vitro transcription and introduced into the cell to induce RNAi. The siRNA becomes associated with an RNA induced silencing complex RISC . Separation of the sense and antisense strands of the siRNA and interaction of the siRNA antisense strand with its target mRNA through complementary base pairing interactions optionally occurs. Finally the mRNA is cleaved and degraded.

Expression of a target gene in a cell can thus be specifically inhibited by introducing an appropriately chosen double stranded RNA into the cell. Guidelines for design of suitable interfering RNAs are known to those of skill in the art. For example interfering RNAs are typically designed against exon sequences rather than introns or untranslated regions. Characteristics of high efficiency interfering RNAs may vary by cell type. For example although siRNAs may require 3 overhangs and 5 phosphates for most efficient induction of RNAi in cells in mammalian cells blunt ended siRNAs and or RNAs lacking 5 phosphates can induce RNAi as effectively as siRNAs with 3 overhangs and or 5 phosphates see e.g. Czauderna et al. 2003 Structural variations and stabilizing modifications of synthetic siRNAs in mammalian cells Nucl Acids Res 31 2705 2716 . As another example since double stranded RNAs greater than 30 80 base pairs long activate the antiviral interferon response in mammalian cells and result in non specific silencing interfering RNAs for use in mammalian cells are typically less than 30 base pairs for example Caplen et al. 2001 Specific inhibition of gene expression by small double stranded RNAs in invertebrate and vertebrate systems Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98 9742 9747 Elbashir et al. 2001 Duplexes of 21 nucleotide RNAs mediate RNA interference in cultured mammalian cells Nature 411 494 498 and Elbashir et al. 2002 Analysis of gene function in somatic mammalian cells using small interfering RNAs Methods 26 199 213 describe the use of 21 nucleotide siRNAs to specifically inhibit gene expression in mammalian cell lines and Kim et al. 2005 Synthetic dsRNA Dicer substrates enhance RNAi potency and efficacy Nature Biotechnology 23 222 226 describes use of 25 30 nucleotide duplexes . The sense and antisense strands of a siRNA are typically but not necessarily completely complementary to each other over the double stranded region of the siRNA excluding any overhangs . The antisense strand is typically completely complementary to the target mRNA over the same region although some nucleotide substitutions can be tolerated e.g. a one or two nucleotide mismatch between the antisense strand and the mRNA can still result in RNAi although at reduced efficiency . The ends of the double stranded region are typically more tolerant to substitution than the middle for example as little as 15 bp base pairs of complementarity between the antisense strand and the target mRNA in the context of a 21 mer with a 19 bp double stranded region has been shown to result in a functional siRNA see e.g. Czaudema et al. 2003 Structural variations and stabilizing modifications of synthetic siRNAs in mammalian cells Nucl Acids Res 31 2705 2716 . Any overhangs can but need not be complementary to the target mRNA for example TT two 2 deoxythymidines overhangs are frequently used to reduce synthesis costs.

Although double stranded RNAs e.g. double stranded siRNAs were initially thought to be required to initiate RNAi several recent reports indicate that the antisense strand of such siRNAs is sufficient to initiate RNAi. Single stranded antisense siRNAs can initiate RNAi through the same pathway as double stranded siRNAs as evidenced for example by the appearance of specific mRNA endonucleolytic cleavage fragments . As for double stranded interfering RNAs characteristics of high efficiency single stranded siRNAs may vary by cell type e.g. a 5 phosphate may be required on the antisense strand for efficient induction of RNAi in some cell types while a free 5 hydroxyl is sufficient in other cell types capable of phosphorylating the hydroxyl . See e.g. Martinez et al. 2002 Single stranded antisense siRNAs guide target RNA cleavage in RNAi Cell 110 563 574 Amarzguioui et al. 2003 Tolerance for mutations and chemical modifications in a siRNA Nucl. Acids Res. 31 589 595 Holen et al. 2003 Similar behavior of single strand and double strand siRNAs suggests that they act through a common RNAi pathway Nucl. Acids Res. 31 2401 2407 and Schwarz et al. 2002 Mol. Cell. 10 537 548.

Due to currently unexplained differences in efficiency between siRNAs corresponding to different regions of a given target mRNA several siRNAs are typically designed and tested against the target mRNA to determine which siRNA is most effective. Interfering RNAs can also be produced as small hairpin RNAs shRNAs also called short hairpin RNAs which are processed in the cell into siRNA like molecules that initiate RNAi see e.g. Siolas et al. 2005 Synthetic shRNAs as potent RNAi triggers Nature Biotechnology 23 227 231 . Such hairpins can be encoded by genes introduced into the cell or organism optionally under the control of inducible or other desired promoters.

Further details on RNAi and induction thereof are available in the art see e.g. references herein.

See e.g. the Examples section below for an example of RNAi in as well as for references describing useful libraries of RNAi constructs.

The presence of RNA particularly double stranded RNA in a cell can result in inhibition of expression of a gene comprising a sequence identical or nearly identical to that of the RNA through mechanisms other than RNAi. For example double stranded RNAs that are partially complementary to a target mRNA can repress translation of the mRNA without affecting its stability. As another example double stranded RNAs can induce histone methylation and heterochromatin formation leading to transcriptional silencing of a gene comprising a sequence identical or nearly identical to that of the RNA see e.g. Schramke and Allshire 2003 Hairpin RNAs and retrotransposon LTRs effect RNAi and chromatin based gene silencing Science 301 1069 1074 Kawasaki and Taira 2004 Induction of DNA methylation and gene silencing by short interfering RNAs in human cells Nature 431 211 217 and Morris et al. 2004 Small interfering RNA induced transcriptional gene silencing in human cells Science 305 1289 1292 .

Short RNAs called microRNAs miRNAs have been identified in a variety of species. Typically these endogenous RNAs are each transcribed as a long RNA and then processed to a pre miRNA of approximately 60 75 nucleotides that forms an imperfect hairpin stem loop structure. The pre miRNA is typically then cleaved e.g. by Dicer to form the mature miRNA. Mature miRNAs are typically approximately 21 25 nucleotides in length but can vary e.g. from about 14 to about 25 or more nucleotides. Some though not all miRNAs have been shown to inhibit translation of mRNAs bearing partially complementary sequences. Such miRNAs contain one or more internal mismatches to the corresponding mRNA that are predicted to result in a bulge in the center of the duplex formed by the binding of the miRNA antisense strand to the mRNA. The miRNA typically forms approximately 14 17 Watson Crick base pairs with the mRNA additional wobble base pairs can also be formed. In addition short synthetic double stranded RNAs e.g. similar to siRNAs containing central mismatches to the corresponding mRNA have been shown to repress translation but not initiate degradation of the mRNA. See for example Zeng et al. 2003 MicroRNAs and small interfering RNAs can inhibit mRNA expression by similar mechanisms Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100 9779 9784 Doench et al. 2003 siRNAs can function as miRNAs Genes Dev. 17 438 442 Bartel and Bartel 2003 MicroRNAs At the root of plant development Plant Physiology 132 709 717 Schwarz and Zamore 2002 Why do miRNAs live in the miRNP Genes Dev. 16 1025 1031 Tang et al. 2003 A biochemical framework for RNA silencing in plants Genes Dev. 17 49 63 Meister et al. 2004 Sequence specific inhibition of microRNA and siRNA induced RNA silencing RNA 10 544 550 Nelson et al. 2003 The microRNA world Small is mighty Trends Biochem.

The cellular machinery involved in translational repression of mRNAs by partially complementary RNAs e.g. certain miRNAs appears to partially overlap that involved in RNAi although as noted translation of the mRNAs not their stability is affected and the mRNAs are typically not degraded.

The location and or size of the bulge s formed when the antisense strand of the RNA binds the mRNA can affect the ability of the RNA to repress translation of the mRNA. Similarly location and or size of any bulges within the RNA itself can also affect efficiency of translational repression. See e.g. the references above. Typically translational repression is most effective when the antisense strand of the RNA is complementary to the 3 untranslated region 3 UTR of the mRNA. Multiple repeats e.g. tandem repeats of the sequence complementary to the antisense strand of the RNA can also provide more effective translational repression for example some mRNAs that are translationally repressed by endogenous miRNAs contain 7 8 repeats of the miRNA binding sequence at their 3 UTRs. It is worth noting that translational repression appears to be more dependent on concentration of the RNA than RNA interference does translational repression is thought to involve binding of a single mRNA by each repressing RNA while RNAi is thought to involve cleavage of multiple copies of the mRNA by a single siRNA RISC complex.

Guidance for design of a suitable RNA to repress translation of a given target mRNA can be found in the literature e.g. the references above and Doench and Sharp 2004 Specificity of microRNA target selection in translational repression Genes Dev. 18 504 511 Rehmsmeier et al. 2004 Fast and effective prediction of microRNA target duplexes RNA 10 1507 1517 Robins et al. 2005 Incorporating structure to predict microRNA targets Proc Natl Acad Sci 102 4006 4009 and Mattick and Makunin 2005 Small regulatory RNAs in mammals Hum. Mol. Genet. 14 R121 R132 among many others and herein. However due to differences in efficiency of translational repression between RNAs of different structure e.g. bulge size sequence and or location and RNAs corresponding to different regions of the target mRNA several RNAs are optionally designed and tested against the target mRNA to determine which is most effective at repressing translation of the target mRNA.

Transgenic animals related to or of use in the methods and systems of the invention are also featured. Accordingly one general class of embodiments provides a transgenic non human animal comprising a knock out or knock down mutation in wwp 1 and or ubc 18 overexpressing wwp 1 and or ubc 18 or a recombinant reporter construct e.g. a wwp 1 or ubc 18 GFP fusion protein or promoter reporter construct in the genome of the animal. The recombinant gene is optionally under control of an endogenous promoter a heterologous promoter and or an inducible promoter e.g. a heat shock promoter and is optionally from the same and or a different species. Exemplary non human animals have been described above.

Methods of making transgenic animals that have knock out or knock down mutations and or that express heterologous genes are well known in the art. In general such a transgenic animal is typically one that has had appropriate genes or partial or recombinant genes e.g. comprising coding sequences coupled to a promoter introduced into one or more of its cells artificially. For example a DNA can be integrated randomly e.g. by injecting it into the pronucleus of a fertilized ovum such that the DNA can integrate anywhere in the genome without need for homology between the injected DNA and the host genome. P element mediated transduction in provides one such classical and well understood system. As another example targeted insertion can be accomplished e.g. by introducing the heterologous DNA e.g. into embryonic stem ES cells and selecting for cells in which the heterologous DNA has undergone homologous recombination with homologous sequences of the cellular genome. This is common particularly in non human mammalian transgenic systems e.g. in making transgenic rodents such as transgenic mice.

As noted one common use of targeted insertion of DNA is to make knock out mice. These are useful in the present invention in a variety of contexts e.g. as targets for modulator studies. Similarly transgenic animals that comprise deletions of natural wwp 1 ubc 18 or other dietary restriction pathway genes can also include targeted insertion of corresponding human genes. This provides an improved model system that is more highly correlated with the human pathway.

In these approaches typically homologous recombination is used to insert a selectable gene e.g. an antibiotic resistance gene or another positive selectable marker driven by a constitutive promoter into an essential exon of the gene that one wishes to disrupt e.g. the first coding exon . To accomplish this the selectable marker is flanked by large stretches of DNA that match the genomic sequences surrounding the desired insertion point typically there are several kilobases of homology between the heterologous and genomic DNA . Once this construct is electroporated into ES cells the cells own machinery performs the homologous recombination. To make it possible to select against ES cells that incorporate DNA by non homologous recombination e.g. random insertion it is common for targeting constructs to include a negatively selectable gene outside the region intended to undergo recombination typically the gene is cloned adjacent to the shorter of the two regions of genomic homology . Because DNA lying outside the regions of genomic homology is lost during homologous recombination cells undergoing homologous recombination cannot be selected against whereas cells undergoing random integration of DNA often can. A commonly used gene for negative selection is the herpes virus thymidine kinase gene which confers sensitivity to the drug gancyclovir.

Following positive selection and negative selection if desired ES cell clones are screened for incorporation of the construct into the correct genomic locus. Typically one designs a targeting construct so that a band normally seen on a Southern blot or following PCR amplification becomes replaced by a band of a predicted size when homologous recombination occurs. Since ES cells are diploid only one allele is usually altered by the recombination event so when appropriate targeting has occurred one usually sees bands representing both wild type and targeted alleles.

The embryonic stem ES cells that are used for targeted insertion are derived from the inner cell masses of blastocysts early mouse embryos . These cells are pluripotent meaning they can develop into any type of tissue.

Once positive ES clones have been grown up and frozen the production of transgenic animals can begin. Donor females are mated blastocysts are harvested and several ES cells are injected into each blastocyst. Blastocysts are then implanted into a uterine horn of each recipient. By choosing an appropriate donor strain the detection of chimeric offspring i.e. those in which some fraction of tissue is derived from the transgenic ES cells can be as simple as observing hair and or eye color. If the transgenic ES cells do not contribute to the germline sperm or eggs the transgene cannot be passed on to offspring. It will be evident that analogous techniques can be used to introduce essentially any heterologous gene of interest instead of or in addition to knocking out an endogenous gene in the mouse.

Methods for making transgenic insects particularly have also been described. For example use of P elements to make transgenic flies is well known in the art. P elements can be used e.g. to knock out or knock down expression of an endogenous gene and or to introduce a heterologous gene. Typically the gene of interest is placed between P element ends usually within a plasmid and injected into pre blastoderm embryos in the presence of transposase. The P element then transposes from the plasmid to a random chromosomal site carrying the gene with it. The P element typically also carries a second gene for convenient identification of transformants. A visible marker such as an eye color gene is generally preferred although other markers can be employed e.g. a selectable marker such as neomycin resistance. The transposase can be provided for example by binding a purified transposase protein to the element prior to injection by coinjecting a transposase encoding helper plasmid or most typically by injecting directly into embryos that have an endogenous transposase. The transposase bearing chromosome can be marked with a dominant mutation such that stable transformants lacking the transposase gene can be selected among the progeny.

A variety of P element vectors are available in the art including vectors to facilitate expression of the gene of interest in particular tissues at particular times in development or upon induction by elevated temperature for example. Additional vectors can readily be constructed or modified as needed. Available vectors include those encoding the FLP site specific recombinase and bearing its target site FRT which can be used to generate somatic mosaics by site specific recombination. P element mediated transformation can also be employed to achieve gene replacement by making use of P induced double strand breaks. In addition a P element can be mobilized such that insertion occurs at a large number of random sites. Progeny bearing such insertions are then screened to identify lines in which the element is inserted within a desired gene e.g. to reduce or eliminate expression of the gene.

Similar techniques enable construction of transgenic animals of other species. Additional details are available in the art. See e.g. Ashbumer et al. 2004 2Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Greenspan 2004 2Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Sullivan et al. eds 2000 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Roberts ed 1998 Oxford University Press USA Schepers 2005 Wiley VCH Nagy et al. eds 2002 3Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Tymms and Kola eds 2001 Methods in Molecular Biology Humana Press Hofker and van Deursen eds 2002 Methods in Molecular Biology Humana Press Hope ed 2002 Practical Approach Series Oxford University Press USA and Strange ed 2006 Methods in Molecular Biology Humana Press. See also the Examples section herein.

As with the murine system described above human genes in the relevant pathway e.g. wwp 1 ubc 18 or other genes in the dietary restriction pathway can be introduced into or or any other model organism to more accurately screen for modulators of the human genes and to study human gene function.

Transgenic animals are a useful tool for studying gene function and testing modulators or potential modulators. For example a variety of transgenic animals useful in the screening systems and methods of the present invention have been described in detail above. As an additional example human or other selected homolog genes can be introduced in place of the endogenous wwp 1 ubc 18 and or other related genes of a laboratory animal making it possible to study function of the human or other polypeptide or complex in the easily manipulated and studied laboratory animal. It will be appreciated that there is not always precise correspondence between protein structure or function of different animals making the ability to study the human or other gene of interest particularly useful when developing clinical candidate modulators. Although similar genetic manipulations can be performed in tissue culture the interaction of wwp 1 ubc 18 and other genes in the pathway in the context of an intact organism can provide a more complete and physiologically relevant picture of function than could be achieved in non cell based assays or simple cell based screening assays. Accordingly transgenic animals are particularly useful when analyzing modulators identified in high throughput in vitro e.g. cell free and or cell based systems. As another advantage in higher organisms with at least two wwp 1 homolog genes such as humans compounds that selectively induce or inhibit the activity or expression of one wwp 1 protein and not another may be identified in assays using pairs of such transgenic animals or similarly pairs of transgenic cell lines in cell based assays each only expressing one wwp 1 homolog gene and comparing the effect of the compound on each organism or cell line .

Of particular interest in the present invention are nucleic acids that encode a protein component of the pathway that mediates dietary restriction induced longevity e.g. wwp 1 and ubc 18 genes that regulate the pathway and polypeptides that are components of or that regulate the pathway. As noted above such genes nucleic acids and proteins of interest include those from as well as homologs and orthologs thereof. Sequences substantially identical to the nucleotide or amino acid sequences thereof are also of interest in the present invention.

The terms identical or percent identity in the context of two or more nucleic acid or polypeptide sequences refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same or have a specified percentage of amino acid residues or nucleotides that are the same when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence as measured using one of the sequence comparison algorithms described below or other algorithms available to persons of skill or by visual inspection.

The phrase substantially identical in the context of two nucleic acids or polypeptides e.g. DNAs encoding a dietary restriction pathway component or domain thereof or the amino acid sequence of a dietary restriction pathway component or domain thereof refers to two or more sequences or subsequences that have at least about 60 about 80 about 90 about 95 about 98 or about 99 or more nucleotide or amino acid residue identity when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence as measured using a sequence comparison algorithm or by visual inspection. Such substantially identical sequences are typically considered to be homologous without reference to actual ancestry. Preferably the substantial identity exists over a region of the sequences that is at least about 50 residues in length more preferably over a region of at least about 100 residues and most preferably the sequences are substantially identical over at least about 150 residues at least about 250 residues or over the full length of the two sequences to be compared.

Proteins and or protein sequences are homologous when they are derived naturally or artificially from a common ancestral protein or protein sequence. Similarly nucleic acids and or nucleic acid sequences are homologous when they are derived naturally or artificially from a common ancestral nucleic acid or nucleic acid sequence. Homology is generally inferred from sequence similarity between two or more nucleic acids or proteins or sequences thereof . The precise percentage of similarity between sequences that is useful in establishing homology varies with the nucleic acid and protein at issue but as little as 25 sequence similarity e.g. identity over 50 100 150 or more residues nucleotides or amino acids is routinely used to establish homology e.g. over the full length of the two sequences to be compared . Higher levels of sequence similarity e.g. identity e.g. 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 or 99 or more can also be used to establish homology. Methods for determining sequence similarity percentages e.g. BLASTP and BLASTN using default parameters are described herein and are generally available. Genes or proteins that are homologous are referred to as homologs. Optionally homologous proteins demonstrate comparable activities e.g. ubiquitin ligase activity ubiquitin conjugating activity or similar . Orthologs are genes in different species that evolved from a common ancestral gene by speciation. Normally orthologs retain the same or similar function in the course of evolution. As used herein orthologs are included in the term homologs .

For sequence comparison and homology determination typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm test and reference sequences are input into a computer subsequence coordinates are designated if necessary and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identity for the test sequence s relative to the reference sequence based on the designated program parameters. A typical reference sequence of the invention is optionally a nucleic acid or amino acid sequence corresponding to wwp 1 or ubc 18.

Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted e.g. by the local homology algorithm of Smith Waterman Adv. Appl. Math. 2 482 1981 by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman Wunsch J. Mol. Biol. 48 443 1970 by the search for similarity method of Pearson Lipman Proc. Nat l. Acad. Sci. USA 85 2444 1988 by computerized implementations of these algorithms GAP BESTFIT FASTA and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package Genetics Computer Group 575 Science Dr. Madison Wis. or by visual inspection see generally Ausubel .

One example of an algorithm that is suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity is the BLAST algorithm which is described in Altschul et al. J. Mol. Biol. 215 403 410 1990 . Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information. This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs HSPs by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence which either match or satisfy some positive valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighborhood word score threshold Altschul et al. supra . These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are then extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using for nucleotide sequences the parameters M reward score for a pair of matching residues always 0 and N penalty score for mismatching residues always

In addition to calculating percent sequence identity the BLAST algorithm also performs a statistical analysis of the similarity between two sequences see e.g. Karlin Altschul Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 5873 5787 1993 . One measure of similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability P N which provides an indication of the probability by which a match between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences would occur by chance. For example a nucleic acid is considered similar to a reference sequence if the smallest sum probability in a comparison of the test nucleic acid to the reference nucleic acid is less than about 0.1 more preferably less than about 0.01 and most preferably less than about 0.001. The above described techniques are useful in identifying homologous sequences for use in the methods described herein.

Antibodies to wwp 1 and or ubc 18 polypeptides or complexes thereof substrates of wwp 1 etc. can be generated using methods that are well known. The antibodies can be utilized for detecting and or purifying polypeptides or complexes of interest. Antibodies can optionally discriminate the polypeptides from homologs discriminate post translationally modified forms from unmodified forms or other post translationally modified forms and or can be used in biosensor applications. Antibodies can also be used to block or enhance function of the polypeptides and complexes in vivo in situ or in vitro. Thus antibodies to wwp 1 and or ubc 18 and or a complex thereof can be used as therapeutic reagents. As used herein the term antibody includes but is not limited to polyclonal antibodies monoclonal antibodies humanized or chimeric antibodies and biologically functional antibody fragments which are those fragments sufficient for binding of the antibody fragment to the protein.

For the production of antibodies to a polypeptide encoded by a sequence of interest e.g. wwp 1 or ubc 18 or a conservative variant or fragment thereof various host animals may be immunized by injection with the polypeptide or a portion thereof. Such host animals may include but are not limited to rabbits mice and rats and the like. Various adjuvants may be used to enhance the immunological response depending on the host species including but not limited to Freund s complete and incomplete mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide surface active substances such as lysolecithin pluronic polyols polyanions peptides oil emulsions keyhole limpet hemocyanin dinitrophenol and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG Bacille Calmette Guerin and

Polyclonal antibodies are heterogeneous populations of antibody molecules derived from the sera of animals immunized with an antigen such as target gene product or an antigenic functional derivative thereof. For the production of polyclonal antibodies host animals such as those described above may be immunized by injection with the encoded protein or a portion thereof supplemented with adjuvants as also described above.

Monoclonal antibodies mAbs which are homogeneous populations of antibodies to a particular antigen may be obtained by any technique that provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture. These include but are not limited to the hybridoma technique of Kohler and Milstein 256 495 497 1975 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 376 110 the human B cell hybridoma technique Kosbor et al. 4 72 1983 Cole et al. 80 2026 2030 1983 and the EBV hybridoma technique Cole et al. Alan R. Liss Inc. pp. 77 96 1985 . Such antibodies may be of any immunoglobulin class including IgG IgM IgE IgA IgD and any subclass thereof. The hybridoma producing the mAb of this invention may be cultivated in vitro or in vivo. Production of high titers of mAbs in vivo makes this the presently preferred method of production.

In addition techniques developed for the production of chimeric antibodies Morrison et al. 81 6851 6855 1984 Neuberger et al. 312 604 608 1984 Takeda et al. 314 452 454 1985 by splicing the genes from a mouse antibody molecule of appropriate antigen specificity together with genes from a human antibody molecule of appropriate biological activity can be used. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from different animal species such as those having a variable or hypervariable region derived from a murine mAb and a human immunoglobulin constant region.

Alternatively techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies U.S. Pat. No. 4 946 778 Bird 242 423 426 1988 Huston et al. 85 5879 5883 1988 and Ward et al. 334 544 546 1989 can be adapted to produce differentially expressed gene single chain antibodies. Single chain antibodies are formed by linking the heavy and light chain fragments of the Fv region via an amino acid bridge resulting in a single chain polypeptide.

Antibody fragments which recognize specific epitopes may be generated by known techniques. For example such fragments include but are not limited to the F ab fragments which can be produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody molecule and the Fab fragments which can be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F ab fragments. Alternatively Fab expression libraries may be constructed Huse et al. Science 246 1275 1281 1989 to allow rapid and easy identification of monoclonal Fab fragments with the desired specificity.

In addition antibodies e.g. for detection of protein expression or detection of post translational modification levels can typically be custom ordered from any of a variety of sources such as PeptidoGenic pkim dot ccnet dot corn HTI Bio products Inc. www dot htibio dot corn BMA Biomedicals Ltd U.K. Bio. Synthesis Inc. Research Genetics Huntsville Ala. and many others.

Protocols for detecting and measuring expression of the described polypeptides herein using the above mentioned antibodies are well known in the art. Such methods include but are not limited to dot blotting western blotting competitive and noncompetitive protein binding assays enzyme linked immunosorbant assays ELISA immunohistochemistry fluorescence activated cell sorting FACS and others commonly used and widely described in scientific and patent literature and many employed commercially.

One method which can be employed for ease of detection is the sandwich ELISA of which a number of variations exist all of which are intended to be encompassed by the present invention. For example in a typical forward assay unlabeled antibody is immobilized on a solid substrate and the sample to be tested is brought into contact with the bound molecule and incubated for a period of time sufficient to allow formation of an antibody antigen binary complex. At this point a second antibody labeled with a reporter molecule capable of inducing a detectable signal is then added and incubated allowing time sufficient for the formation of a ternary complex of antibody antigen labeled antibody. Any unreacted material is washed away and the presence of the antigen e.g. a wwp 1 or ubc 18 polypeptide a ubiquitinated wwp 1 substrate etc. is determined by observation of a signal or optionally quantitated by comparing with a control sample containing known amounts of antigen. Variations on the forward assay include the simultaneous assay in which both sample and antibody are added simultaneously to the bound antibody or a reverse assay in which the labeled antibody and sample to be tested are first combined incubated and added to the unlabeled surface bound antibody. These techniques are well known to those skilled in the art and the possibility of minor variations will be readily apparent. As used herein sandwich assay is intended to encompass all variations on the basic two site technique. For the immunoassays of the present invention the only limiting factor is that the labeled antibody be an antibody that is specific for the protein expressed by the gene of interest the particular post translationally modified form of interest or the like.

The most commonly used reporter molecules in this type of assay are enzymes and fluorophore or radionuclide containing molecules. In the case of an enzyme immunoassay an enzyme is conjugated to the second antibody usually by means of glutaraldehyde or periodate. As will be readily recognized however a wide variety of different ligation techniques exist which are well known to the skilled artisan. Commonly used enzymes include horseradish peroxidase glucose oxidase beta galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase among others. The substrates to be used with the specific enzymes are generally chosen for the production upon hydrolysis by the corresponding enzyme of a detectable color change. For example p nitrophenyl phosphate is suitable for use with alkaline phosphatase conjugates for peroxidase conjugates 1 2 phenylenediamine or toluidine are commonly used. It is also possible to employ fluorogenic substrates which yield a fluorescent product or chemiluminescent substrates rather than the chromogenic substrates noted above. A solution containing the appropriate substrate is then added to the tertiary complex. The substrate reacts with the enzyme linked to the second antibody giving a qualitative visual signal which may be further quantitated usually spectrophotometrically to give an evaluation of the amount of antigen present in a sample.

Alternately fluorescent compounds such as fluorescein and rhodamine can be chemically coupled to antibodies without altering their binding capacity. When activated by illumination with light of a particular wavelength the fluorochrome labeled antibody absorbs the light energy inducing a state of excitability in the molecule followed by emission of the light at a characteristic longer wavelength. The emission appears as a characteristic color visually detectable with a light microscope. Immunofluorescence and EIA techniques are both very well established in the art and are particularly preferred for the present method. However other reporter molecules such as radioisotopes chemiluminescent or bioluminescent molecules may also be employed. It will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan how to vary the procedure to suit the required use.

Antibodies specific for wwp 1 and or ubc 18 are useful in modulating e.g. increasing lifespan as well as in targeting cells that express wwp 1 and or ubc 18. In human therapeutic applications of such antibodies e.g. where an increase in longevity is desired including any of those applications noted herein antibodies will normally be humanized before use. Thus antibodies to wwp 1 and or ubc 18 can be generated by any available method as noted above and subsequently humanized appropriately for use in vivo in humans. Many methods of humanizing antibodies are currently available including those described in Howard and Kaser ISBN 0849335280 2006 . In typical approaches humanized Abs are created by combining at the genetic level the complementarity determining regions of a murine or other mammalian mAb with the framework sequences of a human Ab variable domain. This leads to a functional Ab with reduced immunogenic side effects in human therapy. Such techniques are generally described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 932 448 5 693 762 5 693 761 5 585 089 5 530 101 5 569 825 5 625 126 5 633 425 5 789 650 5 661 016 and 5 770 429. Methods of making superhumanized antibodies with still further reduced immunogenicity in humans are described in Tan et al. 2002 Superhumanized Antibodies Reduction of Immunogenic Potential by Complementarity Determining Region Grafting with Human Germline Sequences Application to an Anti CD28 The Journal of Immunology 169 1119 1125. Any available humanization method can be applied to making humanized antibodies of the present invention.

It is understood that the examples and embodiments described herein are for illustrative purposes only and that various modifications or changes in light thereof will be suggested to persons skilled in the art and are to be included within the spirit and purview of this application and scope of the appended claims. Accordingly the following examples are offered to illustrate but not to limit the claimed invention.

When diet is restricted Dietary Restriction or DR lifespan is extended in diverse species suggesting that there is a conserved mechanism for nutrient regulation of aging. How DR life extension occurs has not previously been clear. We present results herein that uncover a role for the HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase WWP 1 as a lifespan regulator in . We find that overexpression of wwp 1 in worms can extend their lifespan by 20 . Our studies identify wwp 1 as an essential regulator of DR induced longevity. Reduction of WWP 1 levels by dsRNA double stranded RNA treatment completely suppressed the extended longevity of eat 2 mutant animals. In addition the lifespan of wwp 1 mutant animals grown under true DR conditions was not extended. Overexpression of a mutant form of WWP 1 lacking catalytic activity as a result of mutation of the conserved catalytic cysteine in the HECT domain suppressed eat 2 mutant increased lifespan indicating that ubiquitin ligase activity is essential for longevity. Additionally we show the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UBC 18 is also essential for DR induced longevity. Our results show that WWP 1 and UBC 18 function together to ubiquitinate substrates that regulate DR induced longevity.

Protein ubiquitination is required for diverse biological processes and is carried out by a defined enzymatic cascade which consists of the actions of an E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme and E3 ubiquitin ligase reviewed in The E3s determine specificity of substrate recognition via protein protein interactions. HECT homologous to E6AP C terminus E3 ligases promote the ubiquitination of proteins that are essential in a variety of cellular events see e.g. . HECT domains are structurally similar to E2s and possess an active site cysteine residue that transfers the activated ubiquitin from the E2 to itself and then to a lysine on its target protein. A family of WW domain HECT ligases consisting of the mammalian WWP1 WWP2 and Itch were initially identified in a search for novel proteins containing WW domains which are modular protein interaction domains that can recognize short proline motifs in their partners. WWP ligases generally contain an N terminal C2 domain which is a phospholipid membrane interaction motif in addition to their four WW domains. To identify cellular pathways in which WWP E3 ligases are involved we have taken advantage of as a model organism which is not only genetically tractable but also has only a single wwp ortholog wwp 1 Y65B4BR.4 . Disruption of wwp 1 using RNA interference RNAi yields an embryonic lethal phenotype. This lethality occurs late in embryogenesis and is characterized by abnormal embryogenesis despite normal cell proliferation early in embryogenesis. The embryonic lethal phenotype of wwp 1 RNAi indicates an essential developmental function but we were interested in elucidating additional functions wwp 1 may have in the adult worm.

Approximately 15 of genes are encoded in operons. Operons contain co transcribed genes that make a polycistronic pre mRNA that are subsequently separated into single gene mRNA by trans splicing reviewed in . wwp 1 has been predicted to be organized in an operon downstream of two uncharacterized genes y65b4br. 5 and y65b4br.8. wwp 1 contains a putative SL2 site an internal trans splice site found in polycistronic pre mRNAs upstream of its coding region. To determine if dsRNA against wwp 1 specifically interferes with its expression and not with the other genes in the putative operon we performed RT PCR using specific primers for each gene. Worms fed wwp 1 dsRNA had significant loss of wwp 1 mRNA expression but not y65b4br.5 or y65b4br. 8 mRNA expression even after dsRNA treatment over multiple generations Panel B . We find that mutant allele wwp 1 ok1102 has a partially penetrant embryonic lethal phenotype. To confirm the results obtained using wwp 1 dsRNA we have performed parallel experiments with wwp 1 null worms ok1102 that survive to adulthood Panel A .

To elucidate the tissue distribution to which WWP 1 localizes in we generated a gfp tagged wwp 1 cDNA construct under the control of the endogenous wwp 1 promoter which expresses an N terminal GFP WWP 1 fusion protein and created stable transgenic lines see materials and methods . We observed GFP fluorescence in the cytoplasm of several neurons localized in the head and tail and the ventral nerve chord Panels A F . The GFP signal was reduced upon treatment with wwp 1 dsRNA Panels A D confirming that WWP 1 was specifically expressed and that our wwp 1 RNAi construct targeted wwp 1. The cell type specific expression of GFP indicates that wwp 1 can be transcriptionally regulated by a promoter immediately upstream of its coding region. Recently wwp 1 was identified in a RNAi screen for genes required for synapse structure and function. This along with our localization results suggests that WWP 1 functions in neurons in

Prompted by studies in and showing that the nervous system can control longevity 10 14 and since wwp 1 plays an essential role in stress resistance in independent of the early developmental function of wwp 1 we found that loss of wwp 1 decreased stress resistance both heat and oxidative during adulthood Panels A B we went on to determine if wwp 1 plays a role in longevity in . Loss of wwp 1 function by RNAi or wwp 1 mutant animals had no affect on lifespan at 20 C. see Panels A B and Table 3 . However we did observe shortened lifespan at 25 C. Panels A B and Table 3 . To investigate if increased expression of wwp 1 extended longevity in worms we compared the lifespan of our transgenic lines that overexpress WWP 1 GFP WWP 1 to a control line that expresses GFP under the same endogenous promoter. Our two independent wwp 1 overexpressing lines had lifespans extended by 20 compared with the control Panel A and Table 1 implying that wwp 1 is a positive regulator of lifespan.

When diet is restricted Dietary Restriction or DR lifespan is extended in diverse species suggesting that there is a conserved mechanism for nutrient regulation of aging. DR can be reproduced genetically by using eat 2 mutant worms. eat 2 mutations cause neuronal and muscular defects that impair pumping of the pharynx which results in increased longevity presumably by enforcing a DR regimen. We fed eat 2 ad1116 mutant animals bacteria expressing wwp 1 dsRNA or empty vector as a control. Reduced levels of WWP 1 completely suppressed the extended longevity of eat 2 mutant animals Panel B . Suppression of DR extended lifespan by WWP 1 depletion is not likely due to an increased food intake since we did not see a difference in pharyngeal pumping rates with loss or knockdown of wwp 1 N2 treated with vector RNAi 205.2 15.2 pumps per min s.d. N2 treated with wwp 1 RNAi 201.5 11.1 pumps per min wwp 1 ok1102 treated with vector RNAi 202.2 21.1 eat 2 ad1116 treated with vector RNAi 50.3 11.9 eat 2 ad1116 treated with wwp 1 RNAi 53.3 10.1 .

The first report of DR induced longevity in involved dilution of in buffer. A decrease of concentration reduced fertility and increased lifespan. Because reduced wwp 1 gene activity suppressed the extended lifespan of eat 2 mutant animals back to wild type levels we tested whether wwp 1 mutant animals can suppress the extended longevity of true dietary restriction. N2 animals showed a bell shaped like curve for life expectancy in response to varying bacterial concentrations Panel D and Table 2 . N2 animals grown under optimal DR conditions had a lifespan of more than double that of animals fed ad libitum AL Panels C D . In contrast the lifespan of wwp 1 ok1102 mutant worms did not change dramatically when cultured in identical bacterial concentrations Panels C D .

Similar results were observed using a different dietary restriction protocol in which the are grown on solid plates Panels A B . Since different methods of DR may potentially activate distinct signaling pathways or activate them to varying degrees e.g. because they restrict food intake by different methods we also present data using solid plate DR as an additional method to look at DR induced longevity. This method was first developed and verified in Anne Brunet s laboratory. Adult worms are transferred every 2 days to freshly seeded plates with restrictive amounts of bacteria 5 10to 5 10bacteria ml starting at day 5 of adulthood. This method differs from bacterial dilution DR in that animals are not in liquid reducing osmotic stress and that it does not use antibiotics which may extend lifespan by reducing food related toxicity . We found that like under bacterial dilution DR the lifespan of wwp 1 ok1102 mutant animals did not change in response to varying bacterial concentrations under the solid plate DR protocol Panels A B and Table 5 .

Since the lifespan of wwp 1 ok1102 animals grown in DR conditions whether bacterial dilution DR or solid plate DR was not extended and did not change in response to varying bacterial concentrations we conclude that wwp 1 is essential in the increased longevity response to DR.

Recently the Foxa transcription factor pha 4 has been shown to mediate DR induced longevity in . Using our wwp 1 overexpressing lines we found that loss of pha 4 expression by RNAi suppressed the increased longevity of these worms Panel E . This was not seen when these worms were fed bacteria expressing dsRNA against daf 16 the forkhead transcription factor involved in insulin IGF1 signaling Panel F .

To determine whether wwp 1 was acting specifically to affect DR longevity we examined the effect of loss of wwp 1 function on other pathways that influence longevity. Reduction of mitochondrial function by RNAi or mutation increases lifespan. Mutations in the iron sulfur component of complex III isp 1 increase longevity by decreasing oxygen consumption. We tested whether wwp 1 was required for the increased longevity of isp 1 qm150 mutants. RNAi of wwp 1 did not suppress the extended lifespan of these animals Panel G . In addition loss of wwp 1 did not fully suppress the extended lifespan of clk 1 qm30 mutant animals or N2 animals fed bacteria expressing cyc 1 dsRNA Panels A and B respectively .

Partial loss of function mutations in the insulin IGF 1 receptor homolog DAF 2 double lifespan. This is dependent on the forkhead family transcription factor DAF 16. While RNAi knockdown of daf 16 completely suppressed the long lifespan of the daf 2 e1368 mutant animals we saw no difference in lifespan in these animals fed wwp 1 dsRNA or vector control Panel H . Similar results were seen using daf 2 e1370 mutants Panel A . RNAi knockdown of daf 16 had no significant effect on the increased longevity we see with our WWP 1 overexpressing worms Panel F . Our results indicate that wwp 1 is not essential for longevity in this pathway.

Ubiquitination by HECT ubiquitin ligases require the intermolecular transfer of ubiquitin from an associated E2 to the E3 ligase prior to transfer to the target. These transfers are dependent on the formation of a thioester bond between ubiquitin and a conserved cysteine residue that is localized close to the C terminus of the HECT domain. HECT proteins with a point mutation of this site are catalytically inactive and act as dominant negative mutants in vivo. We established an in vitro ubiquitination assay for WWP 1 ligase activity using embryo extract as a source of substrates. We found that in the presence of extract WWP 1 had very robust ligase activity which was abolished with a point mutation to the catalytic cysteine C762A Panel A . To determine if the ubiquitin ligase activity of WWP 1 is essential for the extended longevity seen when animals are dietarily restricted we compared the longevity of eat 2 ad1116 transgenic animals that overexpress a GFP WWP 1 C762A fusion protein under the control of the wwp 1 promoter to a control line that express GFP under the same promoter. We found that two independent transgenic lines overexpressing the dominant negative wwp 1 had significantly shorter lifespans comparable to WT animals Panel B . This indicates that ubiquitin ligase activity of WWP 1 is essential for DR induced longevity.

UBC 18 is a putative E2 that has been shown to regulate pharyngeal development. ubc 18 shows greatest similarity to UbCH7 in humans and is also similar to E2 proteins Ubc5p and Ubc4p. Recently a two hybrid screen using UBC 18 as a bait molecule identified three ubiquitin ligases that interacted with UBC 18 including WWP 1 and a ring finger E3 ligase ARI 1 and F56D2.2. Inactivation of wwp 1 by dsRNA treatment failed to produce a pharynx unattached phenotype in pha 1 e2123 animals like ubc 18 and ari 1 dsRNA indicating that WWP 1 functions with UBC 18 to ubiquitinate targets not involved in pharyngeal development. Similar to WWP 1 UBC 18 is expressed in head and tail neurons Panels A H .

We have been able to show that UBC 18 is indeed a functional E2 and is capable of forming a thiol ester bond with ubiquitin Panel A . We went on to investigate if ubc 18 was essential for DR induced longevity like wwp 1. Like wwp 1 ubc 18 loss did not affect N2 lifespan Panel C . We found that worms fed ubc 18 dsRNA completely suppressed the increased longevity of eat 2 mutants Panel B . This decreased lifespan is not likely due to impaired pharynx function since we initiated RNAi at the L1 stage when the pharynx is completely developed. RNAi initiated at D1 adults gave similar results Panel B . Suppression of DR extended lifespan by ubc 18 depletion is not likely to be due to an increased food intake since we did not see a difference in pharyngeal pumping rates with loss of ubc 18 N2 treated with ubc 18 RNAi 200.6 13.2 s.d. eat 2 ad1116 treated with ubc 18 RNAi 49.1 8.3 . ubc 18 was acting specifically to affect DR longevity since RNAi of ubc 18 initiated at L1 stage had no effect on reduction of mitochondrial function Panel C and daf 2 longevity Panel D and Panel B . These results indicate WWP 1 and UBC 18 act in similar pathways.

Incidentally we note that ubc 18 ku354 mutant animals had slightly shorter lifespans than N2 animals and that overexpression of ubc 18 did not extend lifespan Panels A B probably due to ubc 18 s role in pharyngeal development. We have generated transgenic animals that express ubc 18 GFP fusion protein under the control of the endogenous ubc 18 promoter. We found that overexpression of this fusion protein does not extend lifespan Panel A . It was possible that we did not see extension because the GFP tag interfered with UBC 18 function and in fact we were not able to see E2 activity of our recombinant UBC 18 unless we removed its GST tag . However we do not see lifespan extension in animals that express untagged ubc 18 under the control of its endogenous promoter Panel B . Because ubc 18 also plays a role in early development in the worm and we know that ubc 18 ku354 mutant animals have shorter lifespans most likely due to general sickness it is possible that the developmental effects of ubc 18 expression negate any subtle extension that may otherwise have been observed.

Given that UBC 18 is a functional E2 and essential for DR longevity we went on to see if wwp 1 and ubc 18 function together to regulate DR induced longevity. To confirm the association between WWP 1 and UBC 18 a GST pull down assay was performed. UBC 18 Myc fusion protein from transiently transfected NIH3T3 cell extract could be pulled down by GST fused WWP 1 Panel A . UBC 18 was also essential for WWP 1 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro Panel B . We saw a great reduction in WWP 1 induced ubiquitination when using embryo extract from ubc 18 ku354 mutant worms. However ligase activity was restored with the addition of recombinant UBC 18. Using a purified system we show that WWP 1 exhibited ubiquitin ligase activity in an E1 and UBC 18 dependent manner. In addition epistasis analysis of wwp 1 and ubc 18 showed that knockdown of both genes by double RNAi in eat 2 ad116 animals did not shorten lifespan any further than RNAi of a single gene Panel C . Finally we show that knockdown of ubc 18 can suppress the extended lifespan we see with our wwp 1 overexpressing animals Panel D .

In summary the UBC 18 WWP 1 complex functions to specify the longevity response of diet restricted animals. Loss of either wwp 1 or ubc 18 specifically suppressed the extended longevity of DR animals while not affecting mitochondrial or Insulin IGF 1 perturbed animals. Because E2s often function with multiple E3s it is surprising to find that ubc 18 was essential but also specific for the response to DR. The other E3s found to interact with UBC 18 may be dedicated instead to the developmental function of UBC 18 as is the case for ARI 1. In fact RNAi depletion of these ligases had no effect on the extended lifespan of eat 2 mutant animals and Table 4 .

Several targets have been identified for the mammalian orthologs of wwp 1. Mammalian WWP1 has been shown to associate in vitro with the transcription factor NF E2 and to polyubiquitinate and target the transcription factors LKLF KLF5 and Runx2 for degradation. Most recently WWP1 has been reported to negatively regulate p53 by sequestering the protein in the cytoplasm. WWP2 interacts with EBV latent membrane protein 2A LMP2A and also ubiquitinates the OCT 4 transcription factor. Itch has been shown to associate with endophilin and to ubiquitinate Notch Occludin HEF1 Smad7 JunB c Jun p73 p63 and LMP2A. Itch can also mediate ubiquitination of the G protein coupled receptor CXCR4 at the plasma membrane and of the ubiquitin binding protein Hrs on endosomes.

Many of the mammalian targets described are transcription factors suggesting that WWP 1 targets one or more of the transcription factors recently found to be essential for diet restricted longevity in the worm pha 4 and skn 1b. In addition the genetic epistasis analysis of UBC 18 WWP 1 suggests PHA 4 as a target for ubiquitination and SKN 1 is the worm ortholog of NF E2 related transcription factors Nrf1 and Nrf2. However because ubc 18 wwp 1 pha 4 and skn 1b all appear to positively regulate longevity in response to DR in one model without limitation to any particular mechanism the UBC 18 WWP 1 complex mono ubiquitinates these transcription factors resulting in their activation rather than mediating poly ubiquitination and degradation of these targets. However neither PHA 4 nor SKN 1b have PPxY motifs which recruit WW containing E3 ligases and have been shown to be essential for the binding of NF E2 to the WW domains of mammalian WWP1. Since both SKN 1b and PHA 4 are constitutively nuclear and we find that WWP 1 is located in the cytoplasm even under conditions of stress and restricted diet in another model without limitation to any particular mechanism WWP 1 targets transcription factors that undergo nucleo cytoplasmic shuttling. Examples of transcription factors that undergo such shuttling include but are not limited to p53 cep 1 cJun and daf 16. Furthermore in one model again without limitation to any particular mechanism WWP 1 and the protein deacetylase Sir 2 act upon the same target optionally the same lysine residue within the target to help mediate the longevity response to diet restriction. Because both Sir2 and WWP 1 have been implicated in the response to diet restriction in this model their mode of action is a combined two step mechanism in which SIR2 deacetylates critical lysine residues followed by ubiquitination by WWP 1.

Other substrates of interest include but are not limited to cep 1 p53 see e.g. Genbank accession no. NM001026307 for cep 1 . Recent results identify p53 as a substrate for WWP1 where WWP1 mediated ubiquitination of p53 promotes its nuclear export and accumulation in the cytoplasm resulting in decreased p53 transcriptional activity. In addition expression of a dominant negative p53 in neurons can extend lifespan in these results indicate that p53 is involved in DR longevity because expression of the dominant negative p53 in neurons can not further extend the lifespan of DR long lived animals suggesting that a decrease in p53 activity may mediate a component of the DR lifespan extending pathway in flies. Furthermore loss of cep 1 can extend lifespan in

Autophagy is an important eukaryotic response to cellular stress nutrient limitation. In this process portions of the cytoplasm and cytoplasmic organelles are degraded allowing cellular macromolecules to be catabolized and recycled. Large double membrane vesicles autophagosomes are generated and along with their contents degraded in lysosomes. The process of autophagy allows an animal to recycle macromolecules during times of starvation and stress to deploy scarce resources in a more beneficial fashion.

How autophagy is regulated has been studied extensively in yeast. Autophagy in yeast is controlled by ATG autophagy regulated genes most of which are highly conserved and have functional homologs in higher organisms. Briefly TOR Target Of Rapamycin inhibits the protein kinase ATG1 which would otherwise mediate an early activation step in the autophagic process. In response to ATG1 activity the VPS34 Beclin1 complex stimulates the formation of autophagosomes.

Autophagy undergoes a steady loss of function with age. Inefficient autophagy results in buildup of damaged cellular components and may lead to disease. Restricted food supply speeds up autophagy thus dietary restriction may offset the natural age related decline of autophagy. Recently it has been shown in that dietary restriction produces an autophagic response and that inhibiting genes required for autophagy prevents DR from extending lifespan Hansen et al. 2008 A role for autophagy in the extension of lifespan by dietary restriction in PLoS Genetics e24 .

As in yeast autophagy pathway genes in include TOR ATG6 beclin1 bec 1 vps 30 and vps 34. The foxa transcription factor pha 4 is also involved in dietary restriction induced autophagy in Hansen et al. 2008 supra as is rab 10.

The small GTPase rab 10 has previously been shown to be involved in the longevity response to dietary restriction in Hansen et al. 2005 New genes tied to endocrine metabolic and dietary regulation of lifespan from a genomic RNAi screen PLoS Genetics e17 . Similar to TOR inhibition rab 10 inhibition extends the lifespan of animals fed ad libitum but does not further extend the lifespan of animals subjected to dietary restriction Hansen et al. 2005 supra . Recently it has been shown that rab 10 inhibition triggers autophagy Hansen et al. 2008 supra . We show that loss of wwp 1 and ubc 18 significantly shortened the extended lifespan of animals fed bacteria expressing rab 10 dsRNA Panels A B and Panels A B for wwp 1 and ubc 18 respectively . Our results suggest that both wwp 1 and ubc 18 are essential for the extended longevity of animals with loss of expression of rab 10 by RNAi.

rab 10 mRNA levels fall with DR and RNAi to rab 10 increases lifespan. Since loss of wwp 1 suppresses the lifespan extension otherwise seen with knockdown of rab 10 in one model without limitation wwp 1 is downstream of this event. In another model again without limitation rab 10 and wwp 1 act in parallel autophagy pathways regulating longevity.

The results presented in this example indicate that wwp 1 and ubc 18 are part of the mechanism by which dietary restriction stimulates autophagy and regulates longevity. The results provide further support for the relevance of wwp 1 and ubc 18 and the ubiquitin pathway in identification of novel modulators of longevity and further suggest autophagy pathway parameters as useful parameters to monitor in screens for such modulators.
