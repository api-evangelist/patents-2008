The disclosure of Japanese Patent Application No. 2007 278967 filed on Oct. 26 2007 including specification drawings and claims is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates to a developer apparatus which comprises a toner carrier roller which carries toner on a surface thereof an image forming apparatus and a developing method of developing an electrostatic latent image with toner using this roller.

Techniques for developing an electrostatic latent image with toner include an apparatus which causes a surface of a toner carrier roller to carry toner the toner carrier roller being shaped approximately like a cylinder. For the purpose of improving the characteristics of toner carried on the surface of such a toner carrier roller the applicant of the present application has earlier disclosed a structure of a toner carrier roller having a cylindrical shape that the surface of the roller includes convex sections which are regularly arranged and a concave section which surrounds the convex sections JP A 2007 127800 . Since the concavo convex patterns in the surface are regulated and uniform such a structure is advantageous in that it permits easy control of the thickness of a toner layer which is carried on the surface of the roller the charge level and the like.

However in the case where a toner carrier roller having the structure above is used owing to the evenness of the convexoconcave scattering of toner from the surface of the toner carrier roller fog and the like will be a problem unless a toner layer thickness on the toner carrier roller is strictly controlled. According to research by the inventors of the invention one of the primary causes of these phenomena appears to be that when old toner whose characteristics have degraded in accordance with use is present together with new toner having excellent characteristics the old toner tends to be carried particularly in a far layer from the surface of the toner carrier roller. In a toner layer far from the surface of the toner carrier roller adhesion of toner to the toner carrier roller is weak. Hence it is considered that leakage and scattering of toner and fog are easy to occur.

An advantage of some aspects of the invention is to provide technology for reducing leakage and scattering of toner from a toner carrier roller fog and the like in a developer apparatus an image forming apparatus and a developing method which use a toner carrier roller whose surface is provided with convexoconcave.

According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a developer apparatus comprising a container which houses toner a toner carrier roller which is provided on a surface thereof with a plurality of convex sections which are regularly arranged and a concave section which surrounds the convex sections is shaped approximately like a cylinder and rotates while carrying a toner layer of charged toner supplied from the container on the surface thereof and a restriction member which abuts on the toner layer on the surface of the toner carrier roller to restrict a thickness of the toner layer and restricts the toner layer carried by the convex sections within the surface of the toner carrier roller to one layer or less.

According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided an image forming apparatus comprising an image carrier which carries an electrostatic latent image and a developer which develops the electrostatic latent image carried by the image carrier with toner and includes a toner carrier roller which is provided on a surface thereof with a plurality of convex sections which are regularly arranged and a concave section which surrounds the convex sections is shaped approximately like a cylinder and carries a toner layer of charged toner on the surface thereof wherein the toner layer carried by the convex sections within the surface of the toner carrier roller is comprised of one layer or less.

According to a third aspect of the invention there is provided a developing method comprising arranging an approximately cylindrical toner carrier roller which carries a toner layer of charged toner on a surface thereof opposed to an image carrier which carries an electrostatic latent image the toner carrier roller being provided on the surface thereof with a plurality of convex sections which are regularly arranged and a concave section which surrounds the convex sections developing the electrostatic latent image carried by the image carrier with toner and restricting the toner layer carried by the convex sections within the surface of the toner carrier roller to one layer or less.

The findings of the inventors of the invention based on various experiments although will be described in detail later will now be described briefly. Of toner carried by the surface of a toner carrier roller new toner having excellent characteristics hereinafter referred to as new toner gathers near the surface of the toner carrier roller whereas toner whose characteristics have degraded with long use hereinafter referred to as old toner is contained in concentrated amounts in toner which is on top of the new toner and which is carried as it is separated from the surface of the toner carrier roller. In other words a toner layer made mainly of new toner is formed first on the surface of the toner carrier roller and another toner layer containing a big amount of old toner is formed on the surface of the previous toner layer. Such old toner owing to its reduced contact with the toner carrier roller is not charged sufficiently and hence may leak scatter or cause fog.

Noting this according to the invention a toner layer carried by convex sections in a surface of a toner carrier roller is restricted to one layer or less using a restriction member. This will ensure that toner carried on the surface of the toner carrier roller has favorable characteristics. Hence it is possible to suppress scattering of toner fog and the like.

The above and further objects and novel features of the invention will more fully appear from the following detailed description when the same is read in connection with the accompanying drawing. It is to be expressly understood however that the drawing is for purpose of illustration only and is not intended as a definition of the limits of the invention.

In the engine part EG a photosensitive member is disposed so that the photosensitive member can freely rotate in an arrow direction D shown in . Around the photosensitive member a charger unit a rotary developer unit and a cleaner are disposed in the rotation direction D. A predetermined charging bias is applied upon the charger unit whereby an outer circumferential surface of the photosensitive member is charged uniformly to a predetermined surface potential. The cleaner removes toner which remains adhering to the surface of the photosensitive member after primary transfer and collects the toner into a waste toner tank which is disposed inside the cleaner . The photosensitive member the charger unit and the cleaner integrated as one form a photosensitive member cartridge . The photosensitive member cartridge can be freely attached to and detached from an apparatus main body as one integrated unit.

An exposure unit emits a light beam L toward the outer circumferential surface of the photosensitive member charged by the charger unit . This exposure unit exposes the photosensitive member by the light beam L in accordance with the image signal given from the external apparatus to form an electrostatic latent image corresponding to the image signal.

The developer unit develops thus formed electrostatic latent image with toner. Specifically the developer unit includes a support frame which is provided rotatable about a rotation shaft orthogonal to a plane of and a yellow developer Y a cyan developer C a magenta developer M and a black developer K which are freely attachable to and detachable from the support frame and house toner of the respective colors. An engine controller controls the developer unit . The developer unit is driven into rotation based on a control instruction from the engine controller . When the developers Y C M and K are selectively positioned at a predetermined developing position which abuts on the photosensitive member or is faced with the photosensitive member over a predetermined gap the developing roller which is disposed in this developer and carries a toner of a selected color is positioned facing the photosensitive member and the developing roller supplies the toner onto the surface of the photosensitive member at the facing position. As a result the electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive member is visualized with the toner of the selected color.

The space inside the housing is divided by a partition wall into a first chamber and a second chamber . The feed roller and the developing roller are both provided in the second chamber . With a rotation of these rollers toner within the second chamber flows and is fed to the surface of the developing roller while getting agitated. Meanwhile toner stored inside the first chamber would not be moved by the rotation since it is isolated from the feed roller and the developing roller . This toner is mixed with toner stored in the second chamber and is agitated by the rotation of the developer unit while holding the developer.

As described above in this developer the inside of the housing is separated into the two chambers and the side walls of the housing and the partition wall surround the feed roller and the developing roller and accordingly the second chamber of relatively small volume is provided. Therefore even when a remaining toner amount is small toner is supplied efficiently to near the developing roller . Further supply of toner from the first chamber to the second chamber and agitation of the whole toner are performed by the rotation of the developer unit . Hence an auger less structure is realized that an agitator member auger for agitating toner is not provided inside the developer.

Further in the developer K a restriction blade is disposed which restricts the thickness of the toner layer formed on the surface of the developing roller into the predetermined thickness. The restriction blade includes a plate like member made of elastic material such as stainless steel phosphor bronze or the like and an elastic member which is attached to a front edge of the plate like member and is made of a resin member such as silicone rubber and a urethane rubber. A rear edge of the plate like member is fixed to the housing . The elastic member attached to the front edge of the plate like member is positioned on the upstream side to the rear edge of the plate like member in a rotation direction of the developing roller shown by an arrow in . The elastic member elastically abuts on the surface of the developing roller thereby restricting the toner layer formed on the surface of the developing roller finally into the predetermined thickness.

The toner layer thus formed on the surface of the developing roller is gradually transported by the rotation of the developing roller to an opposed position facing the photosensitive member on a surface of which the electrostatic latent image has been formed. When a developing bias from a bias power source not shown is applied upon the developing roller the toner carried on the developing roller partially adheres to respective portions within the surface of the photosensitive member in accordance with a surface potential thereof. The electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive member is visualized as a toner image in this toner color in this manner.

The housing further includes a seal member which is pressed against the surface of the developing roller on the downstream side to the opposed position facing the photosensitive member in the rotation direction of the developing roller . The seal member guides toner which remains on the surface of the developing roller after moving past the opposed position facing the photosensitive member to inside the housing and prevents toner inside the housing from leaking to outside.

Each one of the convex sections projects forward from the plane of and a top surface of each convex section forms a part of a single cylindrical surface which is coaxial with a rotation shaft of the developing roller . The concave section is a continuous groove which surrounds the convex sections like a net. The entire concave section also forms a single cylindrical surface which is different from the cylindrical surface which is made by the convex sections and is coaxial with the rotation shaft of the developing roller . The developing roller having such a structure may be made by the manufacturing method described in JP A 2007 140080 for instance.

The length L of a side of the top surface of each convex section and a distance L between the respective convex sections may be but are not limited to 10 through 100 m approximately for instance. The shape the arrangement and the like of the convex sections are not limited to those described here. A difference in height between the convex sections and the concave section will be described later.

Referring back to the description of the image forming apparatus is continued. The toner image developed by the developer unit as described above is primarily transferred onto an intermediate transfer belt of a transfer unit in a primary transfer region TR. The transfer unit includes the intermediate transfer belt mounted on a plurality of rollers to and a driver not shown for driving the roller into rotation to rotate the intermediate transfer belt in a specified rotating direction D. In the case of transferring a color image onto the sheet S the toner images of the respective colors formed on the photosensitive member are superimposed on the intermediate transfer belt to form the color image which is secondarily transferred onto the sheet S dispensed one by one from a cassette and conveyed to a secondary transfer region TR along a conveyance path F.

At this time for the purpose of correctly transferring the image on the intermediate transfer belt onto the sheet S at a predetermined position the timing of feeding the sheet S into the secondary transfer region TR is controlled. To be more specific there is a gate roller disposed in front of the secondary transfer region TR on the transportation path F. The gate roller starts to rotate in accordance with the timing of rotation of the intermediate transfer belt and accordingly the sheet S is fed into the secondary transfer region TR at a predetermined timing.

Further the sheet S on which the color image is thus formed is transported to a discharge tray which is disposed at a top surface of the apparatus main body via a pre discharge roller and a discharge roller after the toner image is fixed to the sheet S by a fixing unit . Meanwhile when images are to be formed on the both surfaces of the sheet S the discharge roller starts rotating in the reverse direction upon arrival of the rear end of the sheet S which carries the image on its one surface as described above at a reversing position PR located behind the pre discharge roller thereby transporting the sheet S in the arrow direction D along a reverse transportation path FR. The sheet S is returned back to the transportation path F again before arriving at the gate roller . At this time the surface of the sheet S which abuts on the intermediate transfer belt in the secondary transfer region TR and is to receive a transferred image is opposite to the surface which already carries the image. In this fashion it is possible to form images on the both surfaces of the sheet S.

Further as shown in the respective developers Y C M and K comprise memories and respectively which store data related to the production lot the use history the remaining toner amount and the like of the developers. In addition wireless telecommunication devices Y C M and K are provided in the developers Y C M and K respectively. When necessary the telecommunication devices selectively perform non contact data telecommunication with a wireless telecommunication device which is provided in the apparatus main body whereby data transmission between the CPU and the memories through via the interface is performed to manage various types of information regarding the developers such as management of consumables. Meanwhile in this embodiment non contact data transmission using electromagnetic scheme such as wireless telecommunication is performed. However the apparatus main body and each developer may be provided with connectors and the like and the connectors may be engaged mechanically to perform data transmission between each other.

Further as shown in the apparatus includes a display which is controlled by a CPU of the main controller . The display is formed by a liquid crystal display for instance and shows predetermined messages which are indicative of operation guidance for a user a progress in the image forming operation abnormality in the apparatus the timing of exchanging any one of the units and the like in accordance with the control command from the CPU .

In a reference numeral represents an image memory provided in the main controller in order to store the image supplied from the external apparatus such as a host computer via the interface . A reference numeral represents a ROM for storage of an operation program executed by the CPU and control data used for controlling the engine part EG. A reference numeral represents a RAM for temporary storage of operation results given by the CPU and other data.

Further there is a cleaner in the vicinity of the roller . The cleaner moves nearer to and away from the roller driven by an electromagnetic clutch not shown. In a condition that the cleaner is moved nearer to the roller a blade of the cleaner abuts on the surface of the intermediate transfer belt mounted on the roller and scrapes off the toner remaining on and adhering to the outer circumferential surface of the intermediate transfer belt after the secondary transfer.

Furthermore a density sensor is disposed in the vicinity of the roller . The density sensor confronts a surface of the intermediate transfer belt and measures as needed the density of the toner image formed on the outer circumferential surface of the intermediate transfer belt . Based on the measurement results the apparatus adjusts the operating conditions of the individual parts thereof that affects the image quality such as a developing bias applied to each developer the intensity of the exposure beam L and tone correction characteristics of the apparatus for example.

The density sensor is structured to output a signal corresponding to a contrasting density of a region of a predetermined area defined on the intermediate transfer belt using a reflective optical sensor for example. The CPU is adapted to detect image densities of individual parts of the toner image on the intermediate transfer belt by periodically sampling the output signals from the density sensor while moving the intermediate transfer belt in rotation.

A detailed description will now be given on restriction of toner layers on the developing roller in the developer K . . . of the image forming apparatus having the structure described above. In the developer K . . . of this image forming apparatus the feed roller abuts on the surface of the developing roller inside the housing which contains toner T as described earlier. Further the restriction blade abuts on a toner layer which is on the developing roller at the downstream side with respect to a feed roller abutting position in the rotation direction of the developing roller and accordingly the thickness of the toner layer which is carried on the surface of the developing roller is regulated. When the thickness is not appropriate the image forming operation will be influenced. Specifically when the toner layer is too thin the amount of toner transported to the opposed position facing the photosensitive member will be a little and a sufficient image density will not be obtained. On the other hand when the toner layer is too thick toner may fall off from the surface of the developing roller and leak inside the apparatus may scatter around from the developing roller as a cloud and may adhere onto the photosensitive member to cause fog. These phenomena will hereinafter be referred to as toner scattering and the like .

First the principle of toner layer restriction in this embodiment will be described. In a condition that a relatively thick toner layer that is the thickness being approximately a several times as large as the volume average particle diameter of toner was formed the inventors of the invention conducted various experiments upon the causal correlation between the condition of the surface of the developing roller on which the toner layer is formed and toner scattering and the like. As a result it has become clear that the model below would explain the mechanism of toner scattering and the like.

Out of these new toner Tn having high fluidity and a high charge level is attracted toward the surface of the developing roller due to electrostatic force Ft. On the other hand old toner is inferior to new toner in terms of fluidity and charging characteristics because of burying separation or the like of an additive and hence the power and the speed attracted to the developing roller of old toner are weaker and slower than those of new toner. As a result toner directly contacting the developing roller is mostly new toner Tn as shown in . In short of toner layers formed on the surface of the developing roller the first layer which is the closest to the developing roller is made of new toner.

On the other hand in a layer deposited upon the first layer thus formed new toner Tn and old toner To are mixed together as shown in . This is because coating of the surface of the developing roller with a layer of new toner weakens the influence of the electrostatic force of the developing roller itself upon a layer over the new toner layer and the electric charge of new toner attracts other toner and hence attracts not only new toner but also old toner which has a lower charge level or is charged to the opposite polarity due to deterioration. In this specification the phenomenon that new toner is concentrated inside a layer near the surface of the developing roller whereas a layer far from this surface contains a lot of old toner will be referred to as layer separation phenomenon .

Meanwhile depending upon the electrostatic force of the developing roller and the charging characteristics of toner itself two or more layers of new toner may be formed on the surface of the developing roller as shown in . In such an instance as well new toner Tn and old toner To are mixed together in a layer far from the surface of the developing roller and layer separation phenomenon occurs.

As described above of toner layers formed on the surface of the developing roller in an outer layer far from the developing roller the rate of old toner To is higher. Old toner To only weakly adheres to the surface of the developing roller or to a toner layer on this surface since it has a low charge level. As a result old toner To falls off from the surface of the developing roller and scatters inside the apparatus while being transported by the rotation of the developing roller . Further toner charged to the polarity opposite to the intended polarity adheres to a region of an electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive member to which toner is not supposed to adhere and causes fog.

This model can explain the following experimental fact. For example when a developer containing only a little remaining toner after being used over a long period of time was filled with new toner the occurrence of toner scattering fog and the like temporarily increases but gradually decreases thereafter. The reason of this appears to be that mixing of a great amount of new toner with degraded toner inside the developer resulted in dominant presence of new toner near the surface of the developing roller and a large amount of old toner in the outer most surface of a toner layer. It appears that during continued use new toner would be selectively used which would reduce a difference of the characteristics of new toner from those of old toner relieve the layer separation phenomenon and eventually decrease the degree of toner scattering and the like.

This is backed by an experiment of replenishing toner of a different color from an original toner color. The surface of the developing roller was observed after replenishing yellow toner in the cyan developer C inside of which a remaining toner amount was small for instance. As a result a toner layer of a greenish color resulted from mixing of cyan toner and yellow toner was formed on the surface of the developing roller. However when the surface toner was removed with blown air through brushing off or by otherwise appropriate method the color of the surface of the developing roller changed to yellow gradually. To be noted in particular toner in the first layer directly contacting the surface of the developing roller had a yellow color which was almost the same as the original color of the yellow toner. On the other hand when the image forming operation was executed using this developer it was primarily cyan toner that was scattered around the developer or caused fog on the photosensitive member .

From these results it turns out that layer separation phenomenon occurs in which a layer near the surface of the developing roller is dominated by new toner whereas a layer far from the surface contains a large amount of old toner and that it is principally old toner that causes toner scattering and the like.

Meanwhile the terms new toner and old toner used herein express a concept regarding relative differences in terms of characteristics among toner particles inside the developer and therefore are not necessarily relevant to whether toner itself is fresh or not. For example even fresh toner may contain some amount of toner whose characteristics are inadequate like old toner described above in which case such toner would act like old toner . Further even toner which is not fresh toner can be considered to be new toner if relative differences in terms of characteristics among toner particles are small.

A similar phenomenon could occur even when the developers do not have slots for replenishing toner not to mention when the developers have such slots. In the case where the developer is partitioned into two or more chambers and toner is fed from one chamber to other chamber at a certain timing as in the embodiment for example new toner gets mixed with old toner at a timing of feeding of toner from one chamber to other chamber. Although no auger is provided inside the developers in this embodiment when the developer K . . . rotates in accordance with rotation of the rotary developer unit new toner stored in the first chamber flows into the second chamber which contains old toner at an increased ratio and gets mixed with the old toner. This remains unchanged in a structure where a toner transportation mechanism such as an auger is disposed inside a developer and a structure where toner is replenished regularly from a toner tank which is disposed separately from a developer.

One can see from the above that prevention of layer separation phenomenon in a toner layer carried by the developing roller is effective in reducing toner scattering and the like. It is ideal to form a uniform toner layer of new toner all over the surface of the developing roller as shown in .

In this embodiment a distance G between an upstream most edge of the elastic member of the restriction blade in the rotation direction of the developing roller and the surface of the developing roller which is the closest to the upstream most edge more particularly the convex sections is managed to thereby restrict toner layers carried by the convex sections which are in the surface of the developing roller to one layer or less. Describing this in detail the distance G is set so that the relationship below is satisfied 1

Toner layer restriction in such an instance will now be described with reference to . It is to be noted that in the direction of the developing roller is opposite to that shown in that is the surface thereof is directed toward below. In as the developing roller rotates the surface of the developing roller moves from the left hand side toward the right hand side relative to the restriction blade which is fixed. At this time the distance G between the convex sections of the developing roller and the elastic member is set so as to satisfy Formula 1 above that is set to a value which is smaller than double the volume average particle diameter Dave of toner.

In a region labeled as BEFORE RESTRICTION in where the toner layers on the developing roller do not reach the abutting position at which they abut on the restriction blade yet the closest layer to the surface of the developing roller is formed by new toner Tn denoted at white circles whereas a farther layer which is located below in contains both new toner Tn and old toner To which is shown hatched as described above. When the toner layers reach the abutting position where they abut on the restriction blade in this condition the upstream most edge of the elastic member scrapes off the toner which forms the second and farther layers in the convex sections . This makes the convex sections carry one layer consisting only of new toner Tn.

New toner and old toner are mixed in the toner scraped off in this manner. New toner Tn of this is under strong electrostatic force which attracts the new toner Tn toward the developing roller since the new toner Tn has a high charge level. Meanwhile old toner having a low charge level as well is present at an upstream side of the abutting position with the restriction blade in the moving direction of the developing roller that is at the left hand side in . When the scraped toner collides with such old toner new toner Tn and Tn having high charge levels flip old toner To and To having low charge levels present at the upstream side at the left hand side in in the moving direction. Thus the old toner present in the vicinity of the surface of the developing roller is gradually replaced with the new toner Tn and is driven away toward the upstream side at the left hand side in in the moving direction. As a result in the region labeled as AFTER RESTRICTION in where layer restriction by the restriction blade has been performed the rate of the old toner to the total toner which forms the toner layers is extremely low.

On the convex sections in particular almost all toner is new toner since the toner layer is restricted to one layer or less. On the other hand in the concave section toner layer of two or more layers can be formed to the extent allowed by the gap between the concave section and the restriction blade . However since old toner is expelled also from these layers as described above the rate of the old toner to the total toner carried in the concave section can be made sufficiently low.

In contrast in the case where the distance G is double the volume average particle diameter Dave of toner or larger toner in two or more layers reaches the abutting position with the restriction blade while staying adhered to the convex sections . The toner forming the second and farther toner layers contains old toner at a high rate and such old toner is pressed against the surface of the developing roller by the abutting pressure exerted by the restriction blade . This makes the convex sections within the surface of the developing roller exposed to outside the developer carry a great amount of old toner which leads to scattering of toner fog and the like.

In the above embodiment the distance G between the convex sections in the surface of the developing roller and the restriction blade is smaller than double the volume average particle diameter Dave of toner. However the difference in height between the convex sections and the concave section is not expressly specified. Hence when the difference in height sufficiently exceeds a toner particle diameter for instance the concave section carries several toner layers. This is preferable for the purpose of increasing the amount of transported toner. However this can not be the best from a standpoint of suppressing toner scattering fog and the like since it is difficult to completely remove old toner contained in these toner layers. Consequently the following may be exercised in an attempt to further reduce the degree of toner scattering fog and the like.

In this embodiment the developing roller is structured such that the difference in height G between convex sections and concave section formed in the surface of the developing roller is smaller than the volume average particle diameter Dave of toner. Meanwhile the distance between the convex sections of the developing roller and the restriction blade is a value G which is smaller than double the volume average particle diameter Dave of toner as in the above embodiment. This makes a distance G between the concave section and the restriction blade smaller than triple the volume average particle diameter Dave of toner. Hence toner layers carried in the concave section are restricted to less than two layers. Only toner in the layer close to the surface of the developing roller is left in this manner. Therefore the amount of old toner carried on the surface of the developing roller particularly on the concave section can be further reduced and hence it is possible to further reduce the degree of toner scattering fog and the like.

Further the distance G between the concave section of the developing roller and the restriction blade may be smaller than double the volume average particle diameter Dave of toner while keeping that the difference in height G between the convex sections and the concave section is smaller than the volume average particle diameter Dave of toner. Specifically the distance G and the difference in height G may be set so as to satisfy the formulae below 2

Next a description will now be given on a method of determining whether the convex sections of the developing roller carry less than two toner layers. In the above embodiment the distance between the tip end of the restriction blade and the developing roller is regulated so as to restrict toner layers in the convex sections to one layer or less. However other approach may be chosen as long as it can ensure that only one toner layer or less covers the convex sections . Whether the convex sections carry less than two toner layers may be determined in the following fashion for instance.

 1 an instance like the convex section that is toner lumps TC partially adhere to the convex section so that the surfaces of the convex section is partially exposed 

 2 an instance like the convex section that is the convex section is completely covered with toner and

 3 an instance like the convex section that is almost no toner adheres to the convex section so that the convex section is entirely exposed.

In general toner tends to adhere to an exposed surface of a developing roller than to a toner layer. Hence superimposition of toner despite exposure of the surface of the developing roller seems unlikely. Therefore each toner lump TC is considered to be made of one layer of toner in the instance 1 . On the contrary in the instance 2 that the convex section is completely covered with toner it is highly possible that two or more layers of toner adhere to the convex section. Hence ideal states are the instances 1 and 3 and the most ideal state is the instance 1 .

At this stage the rate of the area covered with toner to the area of the top surface of each convex section is called a convex section coverage hereinafter. Consequently it can be said that a preferable state is where the convex section coverage is less than 100 . It should not matter even though the convex section coverage is 100 as long as there is just one toner layer. However such is an extremely critical. That is one should consider that two or more toner layers are carried in the event that the convex sections are completely covered with toner. Hence the most preferable state in the invention is where the convex section coverage is less than 100 that is the convex sections are not completely covered with toner but the surfaces of the convex sections are at least partially exposed.

A first method for determining this state is a method of visually judging a microscopic image IM as shown in . Specifically when the fact that the surfaces of the convex sections are at least partially exposed is visually confirmed in the obtained image IM it is possible to determine that the convex section coverage is less than 100 . Since the convex section coverage varies some of the convex sections whose surfaces are completely covered with toner and the convex sections whose surfaces are completely exposed like the convex sections and may be included.

As a second method the image IM may be binarized through image processing and the state may be determined based on the binary value. For example reflected light from the respective portions of the surface of the developing roller may be grouped into reflected light from toner and reflected light from the surface of the developing roller based on the levels of the reflected light and whether the surface of the developing roller is exposed or not may be determined from the grouping result.

A third method may be utilization of a cross section profile of the surface of the developing roller. is a graph showing an example of a cross section profile which is obtained through scanning along the line Q Q shown in . It is to be noted that the waveform itself of the profile in does not correspond to . As shown in a cross section profile of the surface of the developing roller after layer restriction is performed is obtained and is compared with a cross section profile of the surface of the developing roller alone. Then it is possible to determine that toner has adhered to portions where the height from the surface of the developing roller is over a certain threshold value Th. This makes it possible to calculate the convex section coverage.

From a standpoint of determining whether the top surfaces of the convex sections are partially exposed instead of the convex section coverage which is indicative of the rate of the area of toner adhering portions to the area of the top surfaces of the convex sections evaluation may be made using the rate of the area of exposed portions to the area of the entire surface of the developing roller. This is because the almost entire surface of the developing roller is covered with toner except for the convex sections and hence the exposed portions are nearly limited to the convex sections as shown in .

As described above in the above embodiments the developer K . . . corresponds to the developer apparatus of the invention and the housing the developing roller and the restriction blade respectively function as the container the toner carrier roller and the restriction member of the invention. Further the first chamber and the second chamber inside the developer K . . . correspond to the toner storage chambers of the invention. The rotary developer unit which rotates the entire developer and sends toner held in the first chamber into the second chamber functions as the toner transportation mechanism of the invention. In the image forming apparatus of the above embodiments the developer K . . . and the photosensitive member respectively function as the developer and the image carrier of the invention.

Thus in the above embodiments toner layers carried by the convex sections provided within the surface of the developing roller are restricted to one layer or less. This makes it possible to reduce the amount of old toner carried on the convex sections . In addition the distance G between the convex sections in the surface of the developing roller and the restriction blade is smaller than double the volume average particle diameter Dave of toner. Hence old toner contained in toner layers is replaced with new toner which is scraped off by the restriction blade thereby reducing the amount of old toner carried on the concave section as well. This makes it possible to reduce the amount of old toner which is transported to outside the developer with the rotation of the developing roller . As a result according to the above embodiments it is possible to greatly reduce scattering of toner to outside the developer fog and the like.

To realize such toner layer restriction the distance between the upstream side edge of the restriction member in the rotation direction of the toner carrier roller and the convex sections within the surface of the toner carrier roller is set to be smaller than double the volume average particle diameter of toner for instance. According to such a structure of toner adhering to the convex sections within the surface of the toner carrier roller the restriction member scrapes off toner in the second and farther layers but not the first layer which has directly adhered to the surface of the toner carrier roller. Thus scraped toner contains new toner which has a high charge level and this highly charged toner replaces old toner which is present near the surface of the toner carrier roller and has a low charge level. Old toner is removed in this manner from near the surface of the toner carrier roller which makes it possible to reduce old toner adhering to the toner carrier roller. Hence it is possible to suppress toner scattering from the toner carrier roller the occurrence of fog and the like.

Further the difference in height between the convex sections and the concave section within the surface of the toner carrier may be set to be smaller than the volume average particle diameter of toner. Degraded toner easily enters the concave section when the difference in height between the convex sections and the concave section within the surface of the toner carrier is large. In particular when the difference in height is equal to or larger than the volume average particle diameter of toner old toner is likely to adhere to new toner which has directly adhered to the concave section. On the contrary when the difference in height between the convex sections and the concave section is smaller than the volume average particle diameter of toner old toner adhering to the concave section gets exposed to the surface of the toner carrier roller and is likely to be scraped off by the restriction member. This reduces the amount of old toner remaining on the surface of the toner carrier roller and hence it is possible to suppress the scattering of toner the occurrence of fog and the like.

Further the distance between the upstream side edge of the restriction member in the rotation direction of the toner carrier roller and the concave section within the surface of the toner carrier roller may be set to be smaller than double the volume average particle diameter of toner. This regulates the toner layer thicknesses in both the convex sections and the concave section of the toner carrier roller to less than two layers. Hence it is possible to reduce the amount of old toner adhering to the surface of the toner carrier roller.

Further the surface of the toner carrier roller may be made of a conductive material. According to experiments performed by the inventors of the invention the layer separation phenomenon above namely the phenomenon that a layer mainly containing new toner and a layer mainly containing old toner are layered one atop the other on the surface of the toner carrier roller is particularly obvious when the surface of the toner carrier roller is made of a conductive material. Application of the concept of the invention to a developer apparatus having such a structure would be more effective.

The effect of the invention is also remarkable when the container includes a slot for replenishing toner from outside. A developer apparatus having such a structure could give rise to a phenomenon that a great amount of new toner is introduced through the slot upon old toner which has been used for long time and is stored inside the container. The above layer separation phenomenon would easily occur in such an instance thereby causing toner scattering fog and the like. Application of the concept of the invention to a developer apparatus having such a structure would suppress toner scattering fog and the like.

This remains unchanged in a structure which comprises a toner transportation mechanism wherein the container includes a plurality of toner storage chambers which store toner the surface of the toner carrier roller is at least partially exposed inside one of the toner storage chambers and the toner transportation mechanism transports toner housed in other toner storage chamber to the one toner storage chamber. This is because new toner is fed onto old toner which is present near the toner carrier roller from other toner storage chamber in this structure as well.

Further in the event that the volume average particle diameter of toner is 5 m or larger the van der Waals attraction acting among toner is weak and toner therefore rolls well which would lead to layer separation phenomenon. In addition since the van der Waals attraction is weak leakage and scattering of toner increase when the layer separation phenomenon occurs. The effect of the invention is therefore particularly significant in the case where such toner is used.

It should be noted that the invention is not limited to the embodiments above but may be modified in various manners in addition to the embodiments above to the extent not deviating from the object of the invention. For example although the convex sections of the developing roller are lozenge shaped in the above embodiments this is not limiting. The convex sections may be shaped differently such as circles and triangles for instance.

Although the developing roller is metallic cylinder in the above embodiments the invention is also applicable to an apparatus comprising a developing roller made of other material. However experiments performed by the inventors of the invention have identified that layer separation phenomenon described above would be remarkable when a developing roller whose surface is made of a conductive material such as a metallic developing roller and a developing roller made of non metal with metal plating thereon is used. Hence the invention would be very effective when applied to an apparatus comprising a developing roller which has such a conductive surface. In this respect the invention is also effective to an apparatus comprising a developing roller which is made conductive by dispersing a conductive material such as carbon black and metallic fine powder in a cylinder made of rubber resin or the like for instance.

Further although the restriction blade is prepared by attaching the elastic member made of resin to a plate like member made of metal in the embodiment above this structure is not limiting. The restriction blade may be a plate of metal alone or a metal plate coated with resin for example. In addition an appropriate bias potential may be applied to the restriction blade.

While toner for use in the above embodiments is not specifically limited the effect of the invention is particularly significant when monocomponent toner whose change in charging characteristics with time is relatively great is used. Further toner whose particle diameter is 5 m or larger and which exhibits weak van der Waals attraction or toner in which the coverage of an additive over core particles of toner is 100 or more in particular has a high flowability and hence toner separation phenomenon easily occurs and leakage and scattering of toner are increased. When applied to an apparatus which uses such toner the invention is exceptionally effective.

The image forming apparatus in the above embodiment is a color image forming apparatus in which the developers K . . . are attached to the rotary developer unit and toner inside the developers is mixed when the developers K . . . rotate. However the application of the invention is not limited to this as mentioned earlier. The invention is also applicable to a monochromatic image forming apparatus which includes only one developer and forms a monochromatic image for example. Further the invention is favorably applied to an image forming apparatus which uses a developer having the following structure as well.

Although the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments this description is not meant to be construed in a limiting sense. Various modifications of the disclosed embodiment as well as other embodiments of the invention will become apparent to persons skilled in the art upon reference to the description of the invention. It is therefore contemplated that the appended claims will cover any such modifications or embodiments as fall within the true scope of the invention.
