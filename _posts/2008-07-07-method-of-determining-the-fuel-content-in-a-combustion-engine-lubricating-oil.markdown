The invention relates in general to the analysis of lubricating oils and in particular the determination of the fuel content of an internal combustion engine oil.

In the context of the present invention fuel means any type of fuel used in the operation of internal combustion engines for example gasoline diesel biofuels etc.

Methods for analyzing the fuel content in particular of diesel in a lubricating oil are known but are not fully satisfactory because they do not rapidly yield reliable correct and accurate results.

In this field a chromatograph is conventionally used like the one shown in which comprises an injector of the products to be analyzed a polymer for separating the products to be analyzed flushed by a carrier gas which facilitates the elution of the compounds a detector of the said products. In operation the separating column is traversed at different speeds by the various compounds of the products to be analyzed. The detector is for example a flame ionization detector known to the person skilled in the art and has a flame fed with gases issuing from the device . The detector also receives a gas transporting products to the separating column for example hydrogen helium or nitrogen. The detector measures a current generated during the combustion of a compound issuing from the column . The current generated varies according to the presence or absence of a compound in the chamber. A chromatogram is generated to represent for example the current as a function of time.

The use of such a chromatograph known to a person skilled in the art for determining the proportion of fuel in particular diesel in a lubricating oil serves to obtain highly accurate analytical results. However a method using such a chromatograph has the following drawbacks on the one hand a too slow temperature rise of the column and on the other hand a too long cooling time of the same column thereby increasing the time of occupation of the chromatograph per sample.

The Applicant has developed a device for determining the proportion of fuel in an internal combustion engine lubricating oil which remedies these drawbacks by using a chromatograph comprising a chromatography column in a particular heating module. The Applicant has also developed a method using such a device in which the column is subjected to predefined cycles in which the carrier gas temperature and pressure in the column are varied and which serves to obtain results that are reliable correct and accurate.

More particularly the present invention relates to a device for determining the proportion of fuel in an internal combustion engine lubricating oil the lubricating oil containing an internal standard and the lubricating oil and the internal standard being diluted in a solvent to form a mixture to be analyzed the device comprising a gas phase chromatograph which comprises 

According to the invention the separating column comprises at least 22000 theoretical plates with a stationary phase present in the separating column in the form of a film at least 0.40 microns thick this stationary phase being suitable for separating the internal standard the solvent the fuel and the lubricating oil. Also according to the invention the heating module is suitable for causing an increase in the temperature of the column at a rate of at least 350 C. min.

The furnace in which the chromatography column is generally incorporated is replaced in the inventive device by a heating module generally located outside the furnace which is advantageously a linear heating module which can be placed either along the column or around it for example in the form of a sleeve into which the column is inserted.

Such a heating module is suitable for faster increases and decreases in temperature than what is usually practiced in particular with a chromatograph of which the separating column is a conventional furnace having a large volume which generates high inertia in heating and in cooling thereby causing a considerable reduction in analysis time.

Advantageously a heating module is selected which is not only suitable for heating the column at a rate up to at least 350 C. min but which is also suitable for cooling it at a cooling rate that is at least equivalent.

If the heating module advantageously consists of a tubular heating resistor into which the column is inserted it is possible to heat the column from ambient temperature to 350 C. at a rate of about 1000 C. min.

According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention the column can be associated with a cooling device such as a fan or a refrigerating unit which allows even faster cooling of the column and particularly cooling from 350 C. to 30 C. in a time of 100 seconds or less.

However hydrogen is preferably used as carrier gas because it serves to obtain higher efficiency in terms of product separation.

According to a particularly advantageous embodiment of the present invention the separating column of the chromatograph has an inside diameter of 0.18 mm and a length of 10 m with a stationary phase thickness of 0.40 m.

The present invention also relates to a method for determining the proportion of fuel in an internal combustion engine lubricating oil using the device according to the invention. In the inventive method the column is subjected to a thermal cycle comprising the following successive steps 

Advantageously the column is simultaneously subjected to a carrier gas pressure variation cycle comprising the following successive steps 

In the inventive method the determination of the proportion of diesel in the oil comprises the following successive analytical steps 

Advantageously the second parameter C may be representative of the area of least one peak of the chromatogram associated with a C C C C Cor Chydrocarbon compound or of their sum total.

It may also be possible to previously calculate an approximation of the diesel content by taking account of a second parameter which is only a function of the peak of the Chydrocarbon compound. Depending on this approximation one can then determine the peaks of the hydrocarbon compounds taken into account in parameter C to calculate the diesel content. The number of peaks taken into account can thus be a function of the calculated approximation.

Advantageously the second parameter may be representative of the area of several peaks associated with respective compounds selected from a group of C C hydrocarbon compounds.

In order to take account of a relative area of the various compounds for various chromatographic conditions the coefficient C is advantageously corrected to bring the concentration of the internal standard compound C5 to a desired value. C may in particular be determined by the following formula 

The mixture formed may further comprise a predefined proportion of carbon disulfide CS. The carbon disulfide has the function of diluting the mixture of oil and Chydrocarbon compound in order to mix them uniformly and to have a liquid and fluid medium which can be separated more easily. Furthermore the carbon disulfide CSis advantageously invisible to the detector even in large quantities. The carbon disulfide therefore does not disturb the detection of diesel and oil. However other solvents may be selected provided that their signal in the final operation can be taken into account.

The calibration line is preferably obtained previously with the same type of diesel and the same type of oil as in the sample to be analyzed in order to maximize the final accuracy.

For the prior determination of the equation of the calibration curve the following steps can be carried out 

From the pairs of parameters obtained for the various mixtures obtained which can be represented by points T0 on the x axis and C0 M0 on the y axis the constants a and b of the calibration line are determined. The constants a and b are for example obtained by using as the calibration line the line corresponding best to the various pairs formed T0 C0 M0 .

The chromatogram may be obtained by a flame ionization detector and in which a computation member makes integrations in order to calculate the area of each peak.

Other features and advantages of the invention will appear clearly from the description that follows provided for information and nonlimiting in conjunction with the appended drawings in which 

The chromatograph of the prior art and also its operating principle have been described previously in the reference to the preceding prior art.

By now referring to the apparatus used for the implementation of the inventive method comprises a gas phase chromatograph fed with hydrogen for example grade N55 and having a precise programming and control of the temperature and pressure in the column. This chromatograph comprises 

An example of the conditions of application of the inventive method for taking measurements of the diesel content in various spent lubricating oils is now described in detail.

For comparison we have also taken measurements using an apparatus incorporating a chromatograph like the one shown in . The apparatus shown in is different from the one in in the use of an apolar capillary column having a length L of 10 m and a diameter of 0.53 mm with a film thickness of 1 m that is a ii L ratio of 5.3 10. Use can be made for example of the apolar column sold by Chrompack Varian under reference CP Syl 19cb. This column is integrated in a conventional furnace.

For the implementation of the inventive method and that of the prior art method the following reactants are used 

Prior to the actual analytical phase the columns of each apparatus are calibrated the one used for the inventive method shown in and the one used for comparison using the prior art method shown in .

This calibration is carried out similarly for both apparatus using standard samples oil and diesel of which the exact diesel content is known and by correcting the internal standard pentane .

To obtain good calibration accuracy a new diesel and a new oil are used as standards corresponding respectively to the diesel and the oil which have been used to obtain the samples for analysis.

The standard samples are then subjected to the process described below for the samples to be analyzed.

For each of the oil samples to be analyzed E1 to E4 the following preparation steps are carried out in succession 

The quantities indicated above are obviously given for information and other values can be used by the person skilled in the art.

For the chromatographic analysis by the inventive method using the apparatus in the carrier gas in the separating column is hydrogen and the column is subjected from the deposition of a sample to be analyzed in the column to the following thermal and hydrogen pressure variation cycles 

For the chromatographic analysis by the prior art method using an apparatus incorporating the chromatograph in the carrier gas in the separating column is helium and the column is subjected to the following thermal and variation cycles 

For this apparatus shown respectively in the temperature of the injector is controlled to follow a temperature program with an advance of 10 C. according to the oven track principle. The flow rate of carrier gas in the column is conditioned by the rate imposed by the helium pressure program and the chromatograph operates with pressure control. For the apparatus of said invention the injector is of the flow divider type and the temperature of the injector is kept constant at 320 C.

For the two apparatus the hydrogen flow rate in the detector is about 30 ml min and the air flow rate in this detector is about 400 ml min to the nearest 10 ml min.

For integrating the peaks of the various compounds the following periods were used in the chromatography cycle 

Advantageously the integration times of the various compounds are adjusted according to the aging of the column and controlled with the reference solution.

For the two analyses by the inventive method and by the prior art method the chromatograms obtained are analyzed to extract the areas of the peaks associated with the various compounds. Let A0 be the area extracted for the internal standard pentane A1 being the area associated with carbon disulfide and at the start of the diesel to excluded Cwhere A2 is the area associated up to excluded C A4 being the area associated up to excluded Cand A5 being the area associated up to excluded C.

Advantageously the pentane standard concentration is brought to an imposed value. A relative area of the various compounds or family of compounds can thus be calculated regardless of the chromatographic conditions.

The calibration curve is plotted as follows for the two apparatus that in and the one incorporating the chromatograph in 

By expressing the equation of the calibration line in the form y ax b the values of aand bare determined. Four calibration lines are thus obtained from the same standards.

For a sample to be analyzed the integrations are similarly made to determine the areas Ao A1 A2 A3 and A4. For small between 1 and 4 the ratios

From the ratios obtained and the calibration lines the diesel content is determined by the following formula 

If the lubricant is unknown only the calculation of the diesel content for i 1 is taken into account.

For certain oils which are not superimposed with the heavy components of the diesel having little co elution between the two families of compounds the result to be taken into account is determined according to the diesel content obtained for i 1. For example if this value is between 0 and 2 the value obtained for i 1 is taken into account if this value is between and 10 the value obtained for i 2 is taken into account if this value is between 10 and 20 the value for i 3 is taken into account if this value is higher than 20 the value for i 4 is taken into account. The co elution of the diesel is then taken into account.

Certain oils may have a particular structure for example if Cis present in the mixture and a special integration may be required. Such an integration may in particular exclude the area of the peak corresponding to the compound concerned and require a specific calibration.

Advantageously the temperature and pressure profiles on the chromatograph are corrected periodically according to standards prepared on a solution containing the C C Cand Chydrocarbon compounds with for example 60 mg of each of these compounds for 5 ml of CS . Thus the wear of the column and the change in retention times are thus taken into account.

Advantageously new calibration lines are plotted for each placement of a new column in the chromatographs.

The results of the analysis of the diesel content of samples E1 to E4 with on the one hand the inventive method using the apparatus in and on the other hand the prior art method using the chromatograph in are given in Table 1.

Table 1 shows that using the MURDIGA inventive method it is possible to obtain results as reliable and accurate as with the prior art method and to obtain them more rapidly. In fact for equivalent reliability and accuracy the analytical time is six minutes and 30 seconds if the inventive method is used instead of 2 hours with the prior art method with the consequence that a single analysis is performed with the prior art method but eighteen analyses can be performed in the same time using the inventive method.
