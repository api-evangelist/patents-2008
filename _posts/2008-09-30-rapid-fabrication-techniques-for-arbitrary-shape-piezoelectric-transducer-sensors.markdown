The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.

The present invention relates generally to methods for rapidly making piezoelectric transducers using piezoelectric material. In one possible embodiment the invention is directed to a method for building a transducer onto an inner form with a conductive surface.

In the past piezoelectric transducers have been produced using flat sheets of material that are cut into segments and adhesively bonded to a desired configuration.

The following U.S. patents describe various prior art transducer systems. However as discussed below transducers made by some of the following prior art methods may be unsuitable for use in underwater environments where pressures are encountered.

U.S. Pat. No. 4 787 126 issued Nov. 29 1988 to Oliver discloses a dark field ultrasonic transducer that is constructed with an outer annular spherical or conical transducer element and an inner spherical element. The outer annular element is excited and insonifies a small portion of a part surface near a discontinuity or crack with longitudinal waves or with surface waves. The inner dark field element is not focused to be sensitive to either reflected sound or waves reradiated from the surface waves but detects sound scattered from surface discontinuities such as a crack edge. When surface waves strike a crack edge and restrikes it after reflection from the bottom of the crack two pulses are received and the time delay between them is a measure of crack depth. The crack shape and crack depth profile are determined as the part is scanned. A sphere cone transducer the preferred embodiment is fabricated by stretching thin piezoelectric polymer film over a tool having a ball embedded in a conical surface.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 825 902 issued Oct. 20 1998 to Fujishima discloses a spherical piezoelectric speaker having a small and simple structure a wide sound frequency range and a high sound pressure includes a spherical shell piezoelectric ceramic body which is hollow inside and an external electrode and an internal electrode defining a driving device for oscillating the spherical shell piezoelectric ceramic body. A sound absorber is provided in a hollow section of the piezoelectric ceramic body and a frame for holding the piezoelectric ceramic body is disposed on the outer surface of the piezoelectric ceramic body via dampers for reducing an influence of external oscillation.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 215 231 issued Apr. 10 2001 to Newnham et al discloses an electroactive device incorporating the invention that is conFIGUREd from an electroactive ceramic hollow sphere having an inner surface an outer surface a wall thickness aspect and a radius aspect. Conductive electrodes are positioned on opposed surfaces of said sphere and conductors enable application of an electrical potential between the conductive electrodes to enable a field to be applied to the sphere that causes a dimension change in the radius aspect and thickness aspect thereof.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 654 993 issued Dec. 2 2003 to Zhang et al discloses a process for fabricating a ceramic electroactive transducer of a predetermined shape. The process comprises the steps of providing a suitably shaped core having an outer surface attaching a first conductor to the outer surface of the core coating an inner conductive electrode on the outer surface of the core such that the inner conductive electrode is in electrical communication with the first conductor coating a ceramic layer onto the inner electrode thereafter sintering the ceramic layer coating an outer electrode onto the sintered ceramic layer to produce an outer electrode that is not in electrical communication with the first conductor and then poling the sintered ceramic layer across the inner electrode and the outer electrode to produce the ceramic electrode.

U.S. Pat. No. 7 019 445 issued Mar. 28 2006 to Zhang et al discloses a process for fabricating a ceramic electroactive transducer of a predetermined shape. The process comprises the steps of providing a suitably shaped core having an outer surface attaching a first conductor to the outer surface of the core coating an inner conductive electrode on the outer surface of the core such that the inner conductive electrode is in electrical communication with the first conductor coating a ceramic layer onto the inner electrode thereafter sintering the ceramic layer coating an outer electrode onto the sintered ceramic layer to produce an outer electrode that is not in electrical communication with the first conductor and then poling the sintered ceramic layer across the inner electrode and the outer electrode to produce the ceramic electrode.

The above cited prior art does not disclose a transducer made utilizing a hollow metallic form. For example Zhang et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 654 993 and Zhang et al. U.S. Pat. No. 7 019 445 propose a spherical transducer made from a piezoelectric ceramic.

Moreover the inner metallic coating used by Zhang is simply a metallic coating that is not sufficiently thick to be strong enough to provide support. Instead Zhang utilizes ceramic as the structural material. Use in underwater environments where pressure is encountered is likely to be problematic and may crush crack or deform the ceramic material of the Zhang transducer.

Consequently those skilled in the art will appreciate the present invention that addresses the above and other problems.

It is a general purpose of the present invention to provide an improved method for making acoustic transducers.

Another object of the present invention is to provide a more rapid method for making acoustic transducers.

Accordingly the present invention provides methods for making an acoustic transducer. In one possible embodiment steps may comprise providing a rigid inner shell with a conductive exterior surface and applying masking material onto a first location on the conductive exterior surface of the rigid inner shell. In one embodiment steps may comprise depositing piezoelectric material over the conductive exterior surface of the rigid inner shell and the masking material. Steps may also comprise depositing conductive material onto the piezoelectric material. In one embodiment the method may comprise removing the masking material from the first location on the conductive exterior surface of the rigid inner shell. In another embodiment the method may comprise attaching a first signal lead to the first location on the conductive exterior surface of the rigid inner shell and or attaching a second signal lead to the conductive material. The method may comprise providing that the rigid inner shell is hollow prior to the step of depositing piezoelectric material over the conductive exterior surface of the rigid inner shell and the masking material.

The method may comprise applying the masking material onto a second location on the conductive exterior surface of the rigid inner shell removing the masking material from the second location and or forming a port at the second location wherein the port leads to an interior of the rigid inner shell.

The method may comprise providing that the inner shell is sufficiently strong for use in an underwater environment.

The method may comprise forming at least one port in communication with an interior of the inner shell.

The method may further comprise introducing at least one of heating fluid or cooling fluid through at least one port.

The method may comprise forming threads within at least one port. The method may comprise utilizing the threads as a mounting to hold the inner shell during the making of the transducer.

The method may comprise utilizing a port for pressure balancing of the acoustic transducer for use underwater.

The method may comprise applying an electrically insulating and moisture resistant coating over the conductive material.

The method may comprise forming the rigid inner shell from a metallic material. The metallic material might comprise copper greater than 0.0005 inches in thickness. The metallic material might comprise steel or other metallic material greater than 0.0005 inches in thickness.

The method may comprise forming the rigid inner shell from at least one of fiberglass rubber glass or composite material which may be coated with conductive material.

The present invention may be utilized for rapidly fabricating piezoelectric acoustic sensors. Not only are the acoustic sensors rapidly produced they are far superior to sensors constructed by cut and bond methods whereby flat sheets of material are cut into segments and adhesively bonded to a desired configuration as discussed hereinbefore.

The FIGURE illustrates transducer that may be rapidly produced using a fabrication technique in accord with one possible embodiment of the present invention. In this example transducer is spherical. However other shapes for the transducers may include but are not limited to cylinders cubes rectangles and the like. The method of the present invention may produce a transducer of any shape into which inner shell may be formed.

Inner shell can be any rigid material as dictated by structural considerations. Inner shell may be hollow as indicated and as further discussed below with various advantages for this construction. Structural considerations might include for instance operating in underwater environments wherein significant pressure and or water currents may be found. Copper or copper alloy comprises one possible preferred rigid material because of its electrical conductivity. In one possible embodiment the copper material thickness of inner shell might be greater than 0.001 inches or 0.0005 inches. Note that the FIGURE is not intended to be representative of actual dimensions. In another embodiment stainless steel greater than 0.001 inches or 0.0005 inches could also be used but may need copper coating. Metallic coatings may often be less than 0.0005 inches may be better measured in microns and may be less than 100 microns. However the invention is not limited to the above dimensions.

A suitable rigid material such as fiberglass rubber or glass may be used to form a portion of inner shell . Non conductive rigid materials may be utilized as long as the material may be coated with metal to provide a conductive outer surface. While the material for the internal spherical shell is not necessarily critical the material should be sufficiently strong to resist forces of the environment in which transducer operates.

A spot or masking region such as spot or masking region on an outside surface of inner shell may be selected and covered with a masking material. Masking can be performed at room temperature utilizing vulcanizing silicone as the masking material. However other masking materials such as non corrosive masking materials may be used. The masking material may be removed later in the process as discussed hereinafter.

Piezoelectric layer of piezoelectric material such as piezoelectric copolymer VF2 TrFE may be flame sprayed over the entire outer surface of inner shell . Piezoelectric layer can be deposited by any process that allows control over the thickness of the material. Thickness is typically important for properly optimizing the transducer. Known spraying processes having these characteristics include flame spraying and ordinary spraying. In flame spraying combustion of a gaseous fuel may be used to carry the copolymer piezoelectric material to the shell. In the ordinary spraying process the piezoelectric material may be mixed with a solvent and sprayed on the shell.

Outer metal layer can then be deposited over the piezoelectric layer . Outer metal layer can be applied by flame spraying or sputtering. The primary reason for outer metal layer is to provide a contact on the outer surface of transducer . If required cooling fluid could be circulated through port to control temperature within transducer during these processes.

In one possible embodiment the masking material and the material deposited onto spot or masking region may then be removed exposing the metal surface of the inner shell . Signal leads and may be secured to spot or masking region and to spot or region . For example region may comprise solder or other means for attaching wire . If desired contact poling leads and or signal leads and might be utilized to apply a voltage to polarize the piezoelectric layer .

If required a conformal coating may be applied over the outside of transducer to provide an electrically insulating and moisture resistant barrier.

In order to form at least one port in accord with one possible embodiment a portion of inner shell might be masked before deposition of piezoelectric layer . If additional ports are desired corresponding regions may also be masked. The masking prevents deposition of piezoelectric layer at the port region wherein port is formed. Other means to form at least one port might also be utilized.

If utilized port may serve many uses. Port may be used to hold inner shell while the layers are applied. Heating and cooling may be accomplished through port or multiple ports if required. If inner shell is solid a tapped hole with threads can be used to provide a holding and mounting point for fabrication and installation. When transducer is hollow and used under pressure circumstances port may be used to pressure compensate balance transducer .

In summary the present invention provides methods for making an acoustic transducer. In one possible embodiment steps might comprise providing a rigid inner shell with a conductive exterior surface and applying masking material onto a first location on the conductive exterior surface of the rigid inner shell. In one embodiment steps may comprise depositing piezoelectric material over the conductive exterior surface of the rigid inner shell and the masking material. Steps may also comprise depositing conductive material onto the piezoelectric material. In one embodiment the method may comprise removing the masking material from the first location on the conductive exterior surface of the rigid inner shell. In another embodiment the method may comprise attaching a first signal lead to the first location on the conductive exterior surface of the rigid inner shell and or attaching a second signal lead to the conductive material.

Many additional changes in the details components steps and organization of the system herein described and illustrated to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention. It is therefore understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.
