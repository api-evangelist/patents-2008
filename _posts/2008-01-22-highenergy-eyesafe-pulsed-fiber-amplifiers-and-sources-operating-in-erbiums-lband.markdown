The invention relates generally to optical fiber amplifiers and more particularly to devices and methods of operation and apparatus and methods to make and use fiber amplifiers and devices using fiber amplifiers that operate in and about the L band optical infrared IR wavelengths of about 1550 nm to about 1630 nm and optionally use pump pulsing.

Optical amplifying fibers can have very high gain. When pumping such fibers to very high energies the high gain starts to amplify spontaneous emission ASE which depletes and wastes pump power as well as generating undesired optical output.

The present invention provides increased energy extraction for fiber amplifiers operating in the relatively eye safe 1565 nm to 1630 nm wavelength region called the L band of infrared optical signals based on L band specific fiber system designs materials and pumping techniques.

In some embodiments the present invention provides optical signal amplification wherein the pump light input to an erbium doped optical fiber is pulsed such a system is called pulse pumped . In some embodiments the amplifying fiber is a double clad fiber having an outer cladding having a relatively low index of refraction i.e. lower than the index of refraction of an inner cladding wherein the outer cladding constrains the pump light to propagate only in the inner cladding having middle index of refraction value and the core having a higher index of refraction than the inner cladding and the inner cladding constrains the signal light to propagate only in the core. Some embodiments use index of refraction compositions and or doping profiles that vary the index of refraction across the outer cladding the inner cladding and or core in order to control the mode profiles for the pump light and or signal light. In some embodiments the signal pulse is applied for substantially the entire duration of the pump pulse and the system is designed to supply enough pump power and or to shape the amplitude of the signal pulse in order to maintain an inversion of the active species i.e. a sufficient proportion of the erbium atoms are ionized so as to maintain a substantially constant amplification of the L band optical signal . If the pump light is applied before the arrival of the signal light the amount of inversion i.e. stored power can build up such that when the signal is launched into the amplifying fiber the initial portion of the signal pulse is amplified to a greater extent called overshoot which is undesirable for many applications than are the middle and later portions of the signal pulse. To prevent this some embodiments delay the application of pump light to the amplifying optical fiber until the start or slightly after the start of the signal pulse.

In some embodiments the signal pulse is pre shaped e.g. starting at an initially low amplitude and then building in amplitude in order to compensate for a reduction in gain that can occur if an appreciable amount of pump power is stored in the fiber e.g. if there is a non negligible inversion remaining from a previous pump pulse or if the fiber is optically pumped on a continuous cw or quasi cw basis .

In some embodiments the signal pulse is amplitude modulated within each pulse e.g. in some embodiments a sine wave amplitude modulation is applied such that the signal will have negligible amplitude between pulses but the amplitude of at least some of the signal pulses is equal to the product of a constant which can be zero plus a sine wave times a pulse the amplitude of which in various embodiments is constant increasing or decreasing . In some embodiments the amplitude modulation e.g. the sine wave portion is frequency modulated i.e. the sine wave component varies in frequency during the pulse . In some embodiments the frequency modulation is chirped e.g. starting at a low frequency and increasing in frequency for substantially the duration of the pulse . In some embodiments the chirped amplitude modulated pulse is used in a LADAR system. In some embodiments the chirped amplitude modulated pulse is used in a range gated imaging system.

In some embodiments the systems of the present invention are capable of and do deliver high energy up to and exceeding 20 mJ long bursts 10 40 microseconds s of chirped amplitude modulated radiation wherein the chirp includes 10 MHz 800 MHz modulation frequencies i.e. the chirp in one pulse starts at 10 MHz and changes frequency in a continuous manner up to 800 MHz at eye safe wavelengths in erbium s L band e.g. using wavelengths in the range of about 1550 nm to about 1630 nm with good beam quality M

There have been many reports and products based on pulse amplification in erbium doped fiber amplifiers but to date these have been exclusively restricted to the so called C band in the central band of the conventional erbium high gain window having wavelengths between 1535 nm to 1565 nm which are shorter wavelengths than those of the L band. While this is partly due to a need or desire for short fiber lengths a need driven by nonlinearity management it is also due to a lack of understanding of the inherent energy storage advantage of L band amplifiers. Siegman suggests see e.g. the book Lasers by A. E. Siegman ISBN 10 0935702113 University Science Books New Ed edition January 1986 an advantage of a factor of two 2 for using a four level fiber amplifier versus a three level fiber amplifier based simply on the assumption of half the ions being available in a three level laser and all of the ions being available in a four level laser. In a fiber amplifier however self saturation limits the number of available ions for pulse amplification. When this is accounted for by using the designs of the present invention an erbium amplifier operating in the extreme L band can actually produce pulses having ten 10 times the energy of a signal pulse at the peak of the erbium gain bandwidth. While a greater fraction of the ions are available for amplifying a signal at the gain peak wavelength in a short fiber the L band amplifier of the present invention has an advantage because the absolute number of ions involved in amplification can be increased through use of longer fiber. While the long fiber and associated nonlinearities may impose limits on the peak power measured in watts that can be extracted or the line width of the signal there are applications such as AM modulated LADAR medical treatments and materials processing where relatively long pulses are useful or even desirable.

Even in the nanosecond pulse length ns pulse length regime higher energies measured in joules can be extracted by designing the system judiciously around an L band wavelength. In a cladding pumped system the clustering losses associated with very high concentrations of an active dopant e.g. erbium are mitigated by both the cladding pumping scheme and the off peak signal wavelength. Hence high dopant concentration fibers conventionally ruled out on efficiency grounds for C band operation may compensate for the longer lengths of gain fibers or relative length in terms of erbium ions required in L band amplifiers.

Yb free fibers based on an alumino silicate host therefore become the preferred approach for some embodiments of the present invention. While cladding pumping of the C band signal wavelengths is facilitated by the Yb co doping in conventional fiber amplifiers in some embodiments of the present invention L band efficiency and energy storage actually benefit from the weak pump rate associated with double clad fibers. The main benefits in some embodiments are inversion flattening and mitigation of clustering induced pump losses.

An L band system can be expected to yield perhaps two times 2 the energy in a nanosecond pulsed system i.e. amplifying signal pulses in a range of about 1 ns to about 10 ns and provide a six times 6 advantage in output energy in a long signal pulse system i.e. amplifying signal pulses in a range of about 1 microsecond to about 100 microseconds .

Although the use of the present invention is described for a few specific applications such as AM modulated LADAR medical treatments and materials processing in other embodiments the present invention provides high power and or high energy laser pulses for any number of other applications that benefit from the high power IR radiation.

Although the following detailed description contains many specifics for the purpose of illustration a person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that many variations and alterations to the following details are within the scope of the invention. Accordingly the following preferred embodiments of the invention is set forth without any loss of generality to and without imposing limitations upon the claimed invention.

In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.

The leading digit s of reference numbers appearing in the Figures generally corresponds to the Figure number in which that component is first introduced such that the same reference number is used throughout to refer to an identical component that appears in multiple figures. Signals and connections may be referred to by the same reference number or label and the actual meaning will be clear from its use in the context of the description.

In some embodiments a high amount of pump power e.g. up to several hundred watts or more e.g. in some embodiments about 10 W 20 W 30 W 50 W 75 W 100 W 150 W 200 W 250 W 300 W 400 W 500 W 1000 W 2000 W 3000 W 4000 W 5000 W or more than 5000 W is supplied by the pump laser system into the amplifying fiber s during the entire pump pulse.

In some embodiments the pump pulse is launched into the EDFA simultaneously with or after the signal pulse starts and ends simultaneously with or before the signal pulse ends in order to prevent energy accumulation in the EDFA which helps maintain a constant amount of gain during the signal pulse. By continuing the signal pulse for a short time after the pump pulse ends any residual pump energy will be drained into the signal output which helps prevent build up of amplified spontaneous emission ASE which is usually considered noise for some embodiments between signal pulses. Such a configuration is particularly useful for relatively long signal pulses i.e. pulses lasting several microseconds to several hundreds of microseconds . By starting the signal pulse before the pump pulse is turned on there is no buildup of pump power which would cause high gain at the beginning of the signal pulse and thus result in pulse steepening and thus the gain will be substantially constant during the time that the pump pulse is on.

In some embodiments the present invention uses systems components and methods as described in commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 7 260 299 to Fabio Di Teodoro et al. titled MULTI SEGMENT PHOTONIC CRYSTAL ROD WAVEGUIDES COUPLED ACROSS A FREE SPACE GAP AND ASSOCIATED METHOD which issued Aug. 21 2007 and which is incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments the systems components and methods as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 260 299 are modified to use erbium only doping in large core fibers and or photonic crystal rods PCRs and or photonic crystal fibers PCFs and L band wavelength optical signals and or pump pulsing as described herein.

In some embodiments large cores are used in the EDFA of the present invention which in some embodiments are multimode cores and in other embodiments are single mode large more area LMA cores in fibers PCFs or PCRs as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 260 299. The large core provides a large amplifying volume allowing very large pulse energies by presenting very large numbers of ionized amplifying atoms e.g. pumped erbium ions . Since the amount of gain is reduced by using signal wavelengths in the L band or other wavelengths that are not in the central highest gain C band wavelengths of erbium or other rare earth species if those are used instead longer fiber lengths than those typically used for amplifying C band wavelengths are used if higher gains are desired e.g. when amplifying very short pulses to high powers and energies .

In some embodiments a long pump pulse is launched into the EDFA well before and continuing until the signal pulse starts and ends simultaneously with or slightly before or after the signal pulse ends in order to obtain energy accumulation in the EDFA which obtains high gain and puts very high amounts of power e.g. 1 or more megawatts into very short signal pulses due to the high gain during the signal pulse. By using a long pump pulse and a short signal pulse at or near the end of the pump pulse there is substantial build up of pump power. Some embodiments include narrow bandwidth optical filters between each of several stages and or optical gating between each of several gain stages to prevent ASE buildup as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 260 299.

In order to apply the teachings of the present invention to other wavelengths some embodiments replace erbium only doping in the amplifying fiber with doping using another rare earth element and use signal wavelengths that are to one or the other side of the peak gain wavelength of the rare earth element being used in order to obtain higher pulse energies typically measured in joules where 1 joule 1 watt second 1 Newton meter in wavelengths other than erbium s L band of wavelengths. Generally the present invention works better when using a fiber having a core doped with one or another of the rare earth elements and the fiber amplifier is operating in the L band of the rare earth element being used. Thus in some embodiments a fiber amplifier with a core doped with thulium is used and amplifies a signal wavelength in thulium s L band i.e. a signal wavelength e.g. of about 2 microns that is longer than the wavelength of maximum gain for thulium . In other embodiments a fiber amplifier with a core doped with ytterbium is used and amplifies a signal wavelength in ytterbium s L band i.e. a signal wavelength e.g. of about 1.12 microns that is longer than the wavelength of maximum gain for ytterbium . In still other embodiments a fiber amplifier with a core doped with another rare earth element is used and amplifies a signal wavelength in that rare earth element s L band i.e. a signal wavelength that is longer than the wavelength of maximum gain for that rare earth element .

In other embodiments ytterbium free erbium doped fibers are used but are driven with signal wavelengths shorter than erbium s C band i.e. signal wavelengths shorter than 1530 nm .

In some embodiments as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 260 299 each amplifier stage is separated from the next by a pump block a monolithic interconnecting unit that includes at least three fiber inlets one for the output end of an amplifier stage one for the input end of the next amplifier stage and one for the output end of the pump laser delivery fiber a wavelength discriminating optical component for example a dichroic filter or band pass filter that reflects the pump laser wavelength into the amplifying fiber and transmits the pulse wavelength or vice versa and a narrow band band pass filter that transmits the pulse wavelength and rejects ASE at other wavelengths than the signal wavelength.

The present invention is useful for a number of applications such as LIDAR light detection and ranging and in particular LADAR laser detection and ranging . Long distance LADAR requires high power laser pulses such as are provided by some embodiments of the present invention. The L band wavelengths provided by the present invention are particularly attractive for some embodiments of LADAR systems since much of the L band radiation is absorbed primarily in the front of the eye thus preventing it from reaching and damaging the retina. Other uses include materials processing such as laser heat treating of surfaces laser welding laser ablation and laser cutting. Still other embodiments include medical treatments since many human tissues are strongly absorbent in L band radiation particularly those tissues that absorb wavelengths of 1.55 to 1.60 microns .

Some embodiments of the present invention utilize low gain optical amplifier structures. The fact that these are low gain allows much more energy to be pumped into the active gain medium such that when a signal pulse arrives much energy is available. In contrast when using high gain media ASE amplified spontaneous emission is readily amplified by high gain media and therefore depletes the stored energy before the signal pulse can come in and utilize that energy by being amplified by it.

Our studies demonstrated the viability of 20 mJ energy and 140 W average power targets for modulated pulses of 10 40 microsecond s durations in a double clad Yb free erbium amplifier operating in the L band and using pulsed pumping. Specifically pulse pumping enables energy extraction beyond the steady state energy storage limits while also alleviating pulse distortion under heavy saturation and the parasitic Q switching common when cw pumped amplifiers are operated at low repetition frequencies. L band operation 1570 1610 nm which can be considered as a result of the low peak powers is more efficient than C band 1530 1565 nm operation because of greater pump absorption. L band amplifiers can store twice the energy of a C band amplifier for a given pump power. L band operation also reduces pulse distortion. Pulse distortion can also be controlled by adjustment of fiber length and timing of pump pulses relative to the signal pulses. This timing cannot be adjusted for cw pumping further validating the pulse pumping approach and ruling out the possibility of maintaining good pulse fidelity with cw pumping for some embodiments. Other embodiments that use longer fibers to obtain enough gain can use cw or quasi cw pumping and very short signal pulses e.g. signal pulses between 1 ns or shorter that one ns and less than about 10 ns to avoid SBS to obtain very high output power 1 MW or more while using L band signal wavelengths. In some embodiments the necessary gain for certain applications can be achieved in an amplifier using a plurality of gain stages e.g. a five stage amplifier in some embodiments with gain partitioning e.g. at 12 dB per stage in some embodiments and increasing core diameter of the fibers from stage to stage. Modulation e.g. sine wave nodulation or chirped sine wave modulation imposed on the seed signal during the long pulses is shown to be preserved in the amplifier.

We have found that operation in the L band is optimum for certain applications in that some embodiments provide more energy. These results are seen in the plot of pulse energy versus pulse number in and the plot of the distortion ratio versus pulse number in for an optimized L band 25 meter fiber with signal wavelength at 1590 nm compared to a C band amplifier 10 meter fiber with signal wavelength at 1550 nm . Clearly for some embodiments L band operation provides a superior operating point and design baseline for certain embodiments needing high pulse energy and low distortion.

Before reaching this conclusion several model runs were made with operation at 1550 nm and 10 meter fiber. These results are summarized in and as a way of showing how the design evolved and what parameters are important to achieving certain requirements. Further detail is provided in the Modeling Results section below.

Some key specifications of the laser required for the AM modulated high energy LADAR source of some embodiments are listed in Table 1. Our technical approach is to utilize a high power high energy novel large mode area LMA erbium fiber in an Yb free double clad amplifier. Energy extraction is increased by pulsed pumping. We show by modeling that efficiency and energy storage enhancement is achieved by operating at 1590 nm in the L band wavelength range. We further demonstrate advantages of the pulse pumping concept. This provides three major benefits namely 1 removal of pulse distortions at high energy extraction 2 avoidance of transient induced Q switching at low rep rates and 3 opportunity to overdrive the pump diodes at up to three times the rated power. Before giving detailed modeling results we will explain our rationale behind choosing this approach.

Some embodiments call for record powers and energies at eye safe wavelengths for sources with close to diffraction limited beam quality. To reach eye safe wavelengths we must employ laser materials that operate directly in the eye safe region or use nonlinear conversion techniques. One of Aculight s commercial products in 1996 was a periodically poled LiNbOoptical parametric converter for pulsed 1064 nm lasers and an eye safe fiber laser heads Aculight s product line today for 3D range gated imaging. It has been demonstrated that a diode pumped fiber laser provides twice the efficiency compared with what has been obtained with optical parametric conversion of 1 micron sources. Materials that lase directly in the eye safe region such as Er glass are possibilities but have serious limitations in terms of handling the average power conditions and beam quality. We therefore sought an approach based on optical fiber.

The wavelength range of 1480 1600 nm dictates that a fiber based amplifier should be based on either a trivalent erbium or a thulium rare earth doped fiber amplifier or perhaps a Raman fiber amplifier. Thulium amplifiers have been shown to operate with reasonable efficiency in the 1480 nm to 1510 nm region but due to the need for a low phonon energy environment to date only fluoride based glasses or other phonon engineered multi component glasses have been employed see Komukai et al. 1995 and Samson et al. 2000 cited above . These glasses are not considered mature enough for high power applications with the development currently only targeting so called S band amplifiers for wavelength division multiplexing WDM telecom applications at modest power.

Raman amplification is also worthy of consideration see Stolen et al. 1973 cited above . For example a high energy high power Yb amplifier operating at 1060 nm could be shifted to the desired wavelength range in a multi pass Raman amplifier. This would require the development of a 1060 nm laser with power and energy at least four 4 times the specification to allow for the efficiency of the Raman converter as well as specially engineered Raman gain fiber fiber Bragg gratings and pulse synchronization techniques. The complexity high initial cost and concerns about nonlinearities such as self phase modulation stimulated Brillouin scattering and cross gain modulation were reasons to reject this approach.

We therefore decided to base our approach on a trivalent erbium doped silica based amplifier. This left one major technology decision namely whether to employ an energy transfer pumping scheme with Yb co doping or to directly pump the erbium ions. Our choice was to directly pump the erbium ions. Our reasoning for this is summarized in the following Table 2.

Some key factors influencing our choice were the better efficiency higher energy storage and absence of power limiting energy transfer bottlenecking see Townsend et al. 1973 . From a manufacturing standpoint the easier processing of Yb free compositions is also a factor.

Some embodiments call for average powers close to the highest reported in this wavelength band and pulse energies orders of magnitude higher than previously reported. We first looked at the design tradeoffs for pump absorption and gain of a double clad EDFA. Erbium amplifiers see Desurvire E. John Wiley Sons 1994 are usually designed to operate either in the C band between 1530 nm and 1565 nm at an inversion close to 0.63 or in the L band between 1565 nm and 1605 nm at an inversion close to 0.38. It is also possible to operate in an intermediate band with an inversion close to 0.5. This as might be expected gives a gain peak between the C and L bands at around 1565 nm. With a given fiber type the L band amplifier is typically six 6 times longer than a C band amplifier. The intermediate band amplifier is typically twice as long as a C band amplifier.

It is clear that from the point of view of efficient pump absorption a double clad EDFA operating in the intermediate or L band will be easier to scale in power because larger ratios of cladding to core diameter ratio are permitted. The larger the cladding waveguide the more multimode power can be coupled into the fiber.

The analysis above clearly indicates that a double clad EDFA should have the smallest possible cladding waveguide dimensions. Of course the waveguide also needs to be large enough to enable coupling of the pump diodes. Our pump waveguide dimensions for the final stage of amplification are therefore driven by the average power requirements at the high repetition rate end of the specification.

At 20 mJ modulated pulse energy and 7 kHz rep rate the average output power is 140 W. In some embodiments our pump power requirements assume a modest 30 efficiency for approximately 500 W of coupled pump power.

The highest brightness pumps currently available commercially are manufactured by Limo www.limo microoptic.com or Jenoptik www.jenoptik.com with candidate sources being 25 30 W pumps coupled to a 105 m 0.22 NA fiber or 90 W to 100 W pumps coupled to a 200 m 0.22 NA fiber. A bundle of five 100 W pumps should couple efficiently into a 200 m 0.48 NA fiber based on the simple principle of brightness conservation. Our design for some embodiments is therefore built around a fiber with a 200 m cladding and a numerical aperture of 0.48.

The energy stored in an amplifier can be approximated by the difference in population inversions between small signal and saturated gains scaled by the fiber length. An estimate the potential stored energy in each of the three amplifier types in the example is shown in . It was assumed to use a wavelength of 1530 nm in the C Band 1565 nm in the intermediate band and 1590 nm in the L band. The necessary saturated gain of 12 dB was targeted and a typical maximum small signal gain of 40 dB for any wavelength within the band was assumed. The results are summarized in Table 3 for a core diameter of 70 microns. There is clearly an advantage in some embodiments of going to the L band for increased energy storage and providing peak powers that do not cause unwanted nonlinearities. The fiber lengths are based on a peak absorption of 20 dB m.

The gain spectra and corresponding energies reported above are calculated from the average inversion model see C. R. Giles E. Desurvire Modelling Er doped fiber amplifiers IEEE JLT. vol. 9 no. 2 p 271 1991 . log 1 

From this starting point based around average inversion considerations we now proceed to a full rate equation based space and time analysis of the double clad EDFA.

Our model implements the standard 3 level rate equations see Desurvire E. John Wiley Sons 1994 for the ground state Ni meta stable state N and excited state Nerbium populations in the EDFA 

The signal and pump powers are determined by the following equations for pumping at 980 nm where there is no emission at the pump wavelength. In our model the pump propagates counter to the direction of the signal propagation.

ASE is included in the model by tracking multiple single frequency channels of ASE separated in wavelength by . The channels are modeled in pairs one channel propagating with the signal and one counter propagating ASE channel. Each of these channels is determined by the equation 

The two sets of differential equations are solved in turn. First the z dependent equations for the power of the signal pump and ASE channels are solved and the powers are updated at each point along the fiber.

After these power levels are determined they are used to solve the t dependent rate equations and update the 3 population levels. These population levels are also tracked along the fiber. The updated population levels are then fed back into the z dependent power equations.

The model uses square wave input for both pump and signal pulses varying the time between the onset of the pump and signal pulses. Modulated signal pulses can also be considered though a finer grid of data points must be used to resolve the rapid amplitude oscillations. The main region of gain wavelengths are divided into channels with ASE power tracked separately for each channel.

In the modeling the following parameters shown in Table 4 were used to achieve the specifications unless otherwise specified. The pump level of 1500 W represents a three times 3 overdrive on the diode current but this level of overdrive is not considered a serious risk for short term diode failure when pumped even at the highest duty cycle called for by this embodiment. At lower repetition rates with pulsed pumping there will be more time for the system to return to the same inversion levels seen before the new signal pulse arrives.

Our model validated our design plan demonstrating that it will meet the required specifications for energy and pulse fidelity for certain embodiments. While running the calculations we identified additional issues and found solutions for these problems.

We initially ran our model to investigate the output pulse shape expected when a square pulse of 50 W peak power and 40 s duration was input to a 10 m long amplifier with a counter propagating pump at 1500 W peak power representing a 3 overdrive of our 500 W of available average power . Although pumping at 1480 nm is more efficient there are not currently any high power 1480 nm diodes available. First we demonstrated that we could achieve the specifications by pumping at 980 nm.

In the initial example a pump level lifetime of 3 s D. L. Harris J. D. Minelly S. C. Guy Measurement of the multiphonon decay rate from the 4il level in erbium doped silica silicate tellurite and fluoride fibers CLEO CWK15 San Francisco May 2000 was assumed based on published data for an alumino silicate host. Because the pulses are long compared to the relaxation time it is possible for the inversion level to stay high even when pumping at 980 nm if sufficiently high pump power is used. For comparison we also looked at pumping at 1480 nm. This turned out to be more efficient but this could be wholly attributed to the smaller quantum defect rather than any limit imposed by the finite pump level lifetime. The results indicated in show that a steady state can indeed be reached within the pulse duration enabling extraction of the full energy.

While the above results show that a of 3 sec poses no problem we looked at the degradation in performance with an increase in this lifetime. The results shown in indicate that when the pump lifetime becomes comparable to the burst duration the energy that can be extracted drops significantly. This further validates our choice of an Yb free fiber amplifier rather than an Er Yb fiber amplifier because the energy transfer rate from Yb to Erbium in Er Yb fiber is of the order of the pulse durations. This bottlenecking would prevent pulsed pumping of Er Yb fibers at the level required in this application. In a Yb free alumino silicate fiber the pump level lifetime is short enough to replenish the gain during the 30 sec pulse.

We expected the amplification to preserve any initial modulation put on the signal and we completed our first study by confirming this. The input signal was modulated to explore whether the amplified output signal would maintain full depth of modulation. The conditions were the same as in Table 4 except that the fiber length was increased to 25 m. We discovered that increasing the fiber length has other advantages as well.

The modulated signal experiences similar gain to the unmodulated signal while maintaining its depth of modulation. A 70 modulation depth of the input signal was easily reproduced by the amplified output at a variety of modulation rates in the range of interest from 10 MHz to 1 GHz.

On the graphs of and the peaks in the input signal appear shortly before the peaks in the output signal due to the time required to travel the 25 m to the other end of the fiber.

In the course of validating our design concept we discovered some issues that can degrade the fidelity of the pulses. We used our model to find solutions to these problems and demonstrate the effectiveness of our solutions.

If the population inversion is high before the signal comes through there is a substantial overshoot at the beginning of the signal. This represents a waste of energy and creates a possibility of damage to the system. Various methods were explored to control this overshoot.

The following SOLUTIONS A through E are applied individually or in any combination in various embodiments of the invention.

Although ASE helped us by reducing the initial pulse overshoot it caused problems in terms of signal extraction energy. These issues are addressed in a later section of this report.

Various strategies were implemented to decrease the initial pulse overshoot and maintain the square pulse shape throughout the signal pulse. The maximum and minimum power during each signal pulse power were calculated and their ratio used as a measure of pulse distortion.

One strategy was to turn on the pump later closer to the beginning of the signal pulse. This prevented as much inversion from building up and avoided the strong overshoot at the beginning of the pulse. When the pulse lead time was decreased from 10 s to 5 s the overshoot decreased. If the pump pulse was not launched far enough ahead of the signal pulse the gain ramped up slowly during the leading edge of the pulse and less energy was extracted during the course of the pulse. The pulse profiles in and show this effect.

Inclusion of ASE in the model greatly reduces the overshoot at the beginning of the pulse as can be seen in . The ratio of maximum to minimum signal power in each pulse decreases approaching unity over time.

When operating in the L band increasing the fiber length led to more energy extraction and reduced pulse distortion. As expected more energy was extracted from the 25 m fiber than from the 10 m fiber. Conventional C band EDFAs use relatively short fibers i.e. about 10 m or shorter in order to reduce non linear effects and can do so because of the greater gain of erbium in the C band. We found decreased pulse distortion by going to longer fibers. When we moved to a longer fiber we got better energy extraction and reduced pulse distortion by launching the pump later 3.5 microseconds before the signal pulse rather than 4 s before the signal pulse. Results for both pump lead times in the 25 m fiber are show in the figures below.

Using a longer fiber operating in the L band at 1590 nm gives far better output power than using a shorter fiber with extraction in the C band at 1550 nm. The model was run at 1550 nm with a variety of lengths and pump lead times using those strategies to get the best results in terms of pulse distortion. The design parameters used for best results in each band are summarized in Table 5.

In summary operating in the L band at 1590 nm and using a long about 25 m fiber results in reduced pulse distortion and higher energy extraction compared to C band operation.

We also investigated the limits of cw pumping for our fiber structure. To explore the role of cw vs. pulsed pumping the model was run with a cw pump power input of 500 W rather than a pulsed input of 1500 W. This would correspond to a 500 W cw pump overdriven by a factor of 3 when pulsed pumping is used. Though the signal was able to extract quite a bit of energy from the fiber with cw pumping there were clear drawbacks. The cw pumping was modeled in a 25 m fiber with L band extraction 1590 nm with a 50 W peak power extraction pulse and 2 W cw extraction signal running between signal pulses.

Once the pulse pumping approach was validated the analysis and design turned to the full 5 stage amplifier with the result seen in . The model was used also used with a cw pump to design amplifier staging for a three stage pre amp to boost the signal from the 1 mW input to the 3 W input needed for the fourth gain stage. In some embodiments fewer stages still providing about the same intermediate signal power are used for the preamp in order to simplify manufacturing and reduce cost. In some embodiments the pre amplifier stages are pumped at 1535 nm using an Er Yb fiber laser. In some embodiments this preamp pump is coupled into standard conventional telecom EDFAs with increasing core size at each stage. At each stage approximately 12 dB of gain is achieved without pulse distortion.

To measure pulse distortion the maximum and minimum power of each amplified square pulse are computed. A steady state difference between maximum and minimum power of less than 1.15 shows that there is little distortion of the shape across the pulse.

Using the amplifier parameters from Table 6 we were able to get minimal pulse distortion difference between pulse maximum and minimum power of less than 0.03 with a 14.1 mW output signal.

The first pre amplifier stage is designed for a core diameter of 5 m and a fiber length of 35 m. Spectroscopic properties and dopant concentrations are assumed identical to those used in the power amplifier model. Pump power was 700 mW.

For the second stage we increased the core diameter to 10 m kept the length at 35 m and increased the pump power to 2 W. Again we saw minimal pulse distortion since the difference between pulse maximum and minimum power of less than 0.03 with a 210 mW output signal as indicated in and .

The third stage utilized a 20 m fiber 5 W of power and again a length of 35 m. We were able to get minimal pulse distortion difference between pulse maximum and minimum power of less than 1.14 with a 2.95 W output signal. This is shown in and .

This output signal generated in Stage 3 was sufficient to saturate the two stage pulse pumped power amplifier shown in .

One way isolator connects the amplified laser pulses from first stage preamp fiber to the second stage preamp fiber e.g. a 10 micron core EDFA in some embodiments and prevents backward propagating signal such as ASE or SBS from the later amplifier fibers from entering and disturbing or destroying the seed laser. In some embodiments coupler couples the output signal from second stage fiber to isolator and couples a portion e.g. 20 in some embodiments of the pump signal from fiber laser pump in a counter propagating direction into second stage fiber .

Similarly one way isolator connects the output signal from second stage preamp fiber to the third stage preamp fiber e.g. a 20 micron core EDFA in some embodiments and prevents backward propagating signal such as ASE or SBS from the later amplifier fibers from entering and disturbing or destroying the seed laser. In some embodiments coupler couples the output signal from third stage fiber to isolator and couples a portion e.g. 70 in some embodiments of the pump signal from fiber laser pump in a counter propagating direction into third stage fiber .

Similarly one way isolator connects the output signal from third stage preamp fiber through coupler to the fourth stage amplifier fiber e.g. a 35 micron core EDFA with a 100 micron cladding diameter in some embodiments and prevents backward propagating signal such as ASE or SBS from the later amplifier fibers from entering and disturbing or destroying other earlier stages or the seed laser. In some embodiments coupler couples a portion e.g. 30 W in some embodiments of the pump signal from pump laser in a co propagating direction into fourth stage fiber . The output signal from fourth stage fiber passes through lens band pass filter which blocks pump light and or narrows the line width to reduce ASE in both directions and lens to the final fifth stage amplifier fiber e.g. a 70 micron core EDFA with a 200 micron cladding diameter in some embodiments . In some embodiments a high power pump laser e.g. outputting 500 W of 976 nm pump laser light in some embodiments is coupled through lens dichroic beamsplitter mirror and lens to enter fifth stage amplifier fiber in a counter propagating direction while the output signal pulses exit fifth stage amplifier fiber through lens and reflect off dichroic beamsplitter mirror in some embodiments these provide a series of 20 mJ pulses that are 30 microseconds long and have a repetition rate of 7 kHz. In some embodiments these output pulses are amplitude modulated with a frequency chirp as shown in . As described above the present invention provides the capability to adjust the pump pulse timing the seed signal shape and optionally other parameters such that the output chirp pulses have substantially constant average amplitude such as shown in and .

To achieve record average powers and pulse energies from an eye safe fiber amplifier some embodiments of the invention provide an EDFA with a large mode area LMA configuration and energy extraction supplemented by pulsed pumping in synchronization with the signal pulses to be amplified. The overall gain of the system must be approximately 60 dB to reach full pulse energy starting from a given seed source. In some embodiments this is achieved using five stages of amplification. In some embodiments in each amplifier stage the dimensions of the core are increased relative to the core size in the prior stage to enable the extraction of more energy while avoiding pulse shape distortion. Nonlinear effects such as self phase modulation stimulated Brillouin scattering SBS and stimulated Raman scattering SRS are not an issue because of the modest peak powers 

In some embodiments the first three stages are based on a reconfiguration of Aculight s PF1550 36 commercial product available from Aculight Corporation 22121 20th Avenue S. E. Bothell Wash. 98021 as a 36 dB gain L band amplifier. This amplifier is cw pumped and operates in the unsaturated regime. Although the power conversion efficiency of an unsaturated amplifier is intrinsically low the pre amplifier uses only inexpensive multimode pump sources. The three stage pre amp has a target gain of 36 dB boosting the energy to 80 J.

Finally we amplify to 10 mJ pulse energy in a two stage 35 100 m and 70 200 m core cladding diameter low NA Yb free EDFA. These final two stages can be either cw or pulse pumped to extract the desired energy. Our initial work indicates that pulsed pumping is advantageous for generating the highest energies in short bursts. These key strategies that will be used to attain the performance requirements of the high energy amplifier are as follows to obtain eye safe wavelength near 1550 nm some embodiments use Er doped fiber amplifiers operating in the L band. To generate 60 dB gain from amplifier some embodiments use a plurality of gain stages e.g. five in some embodiments with an L band preamplifier generating 36 dB of gain and large core low NA Er doped fiber amplifiers for two stage power amplifier. To generate high pulse energy 10 mJ in a pulse length of 10 40 sec some embodiments use a low NA EDFA for high energy storage as a final amplification stage apply pulse pumping to the final amplifier stage to increase pumping rate and output pulse energy during the pulse exploit increased L band energy storage and exploit slower signal saturation in L band. To generate beam quality e.g. M

In some embodiments the at least one erbium doped fiber section is integrated into an AM modulated LADAR system.

In some embodiments the at least one erbium doped fiber section is incorporated into a range gated imaging system. In some embodiments a laser illuminated range gated imaging system is useful for imaging at long ranges and through obscurants such as fog smoke mist haze rain and the like . Range gated imaging permits imaging at long ranges while minimizing the effect of obscurants fog rain or smoke in the atmosphere. In some embodiments range gated imaging uses a pulsed laser to illuminate the scene while the reflected light is detected by a camera with a short exposure timeframe referred to as a gate. The gate has a delay the minimum out and back time of the laser pulse measured from the launch of the laser pulse that illuminates the scene until the pulse returns from the closest object in the range of the gate and a duration the out and back time from the closest object in the scene to the most distant object in the scene . The gate is delayed so imaging occurs at a particular range to ignore reflections and scattering from objects closer than the range and ends after a predetermined time to ignore reflections and scattering from objects farther than the range thus the image is only from the reflection of objects at that range. Laser range gating systems send out a pulsed laser beam to illuminate the scene the reflected light is detected by a shortwave infrared SWIR camera with a short exposure time. The exposure time and a delay from the launch of the laser pulse are synchronized so that they can detect images within a certain range of distances. Long range identification is important for military operations such as target identification and friend versus foe determination called Identification Friend or Foe IFF . To acquire images at night illuminators can be very useful. However using illuminators in continuous wave CW mode can blind the imaging system when obscurants such as dust smoke or fog are present due to the backscattered light. Similarly microscopic particles in water can obscure objects that are being imaged underwater. The range gated imaging system removes these scattered reflections and allows imaging within the desired range only. One key to safe range gated imaging is to employ laser sources in the SWIR band. These sources such as popular 1550 nm lasers are eye safe reducing potential harm to either combatants or noncombatants on the battlefield. In some embodiments high speed gated InGaAs SWIR imagers are used such as are available from the Sensors Unlimited portion of the ISR Systems division of Goodrich Corporation. InGaAs also allows for an all solid state solution using solid state fiber lasers of the present invention instead of gas lasers which reduces long term maintenance and cost. A range gated system images only the reflected light within a certain time period which corresponds to a predetermined range of distances. Different ranges can be detected by varying the delay time and duration time the images of objects at longer distances are better improved by adjusting lengthening the delay to ignore back scattered light due to obscurants such as haze and the like between the camera and object being imaged while objects at nearer distances are better imaged by adjusting shortening the duration of the gate to ignore back scattered light from further than the object. In yet other embodiments the round trip travel time for the light pulse is measured as the transmitted laser beam is scanned over an object to enable construction of a three dimensional image of an object. In such embodiments the time to the latest return pulse may be measured to image an object which may be behind smoke fog foliage or camouflage netting.

In some embodiments the at least one erbium doped fiber section is incorporated into a materials processing system. The choice of using erbium doped fiber and the choice of a particular L band signal wavelength may be made based on the particular material s being processed because the output wavelength is more readily absorbed by the particular material s being processed than other wavelengths are absorbed. In other cases the wavelength produced by the erbium doped fiber may be preferentially absorbed by one or more components of the material being processed while leaving other components of the material being processed unaffected or undamaged because they have weaker absorption at the signal wavelength produced by the fiber. In yet other cases the large pulse energy of an L band erbium fiber laser system can enable materials processing that would not be feasible using other types of fiber lasers producing less energy per pulse.

In some embodiments the signal pulses have additional modulation e.g. amplitude modulation that imposes a sine wave modulation and or pulse modulation fast changing times a pulse shape envelope constant with its start time adjusted relative to the signal pulse and or slow changing to compensate for gain changes during the pulse within the pulse envelope. This modulation can impose structure within a relatively long optical pulse allowing finer range resolution in a LIDAR system than would be feasible with a single long unstructured pulse. In materials processing applications many shorter higher peak power pulses could be generated by modulating a pulse envelope of long duration which can facilitate processing of some materials.

In some embodiments at least one of the at least one erbium doped fiber sections has a multimode core. By permitting the fiber core to be multimode the fiber core can made be larger. This in turn will allow more energy to be stored in the fiber s core and enable higher peak powers to be achieved as well.

In some embodiments at least one of the at least one erbium doped fiber sections has a pedestal profile in the core such as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 567 740 titled APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR AN ERBIUM DOPED FIBER FOR HIGH PEAK POWER APPLICATIONS by John D. Minelly which is incorporated herein by reference wherein the index of refraction next to the core is increased the pedestal and the index of the core itself is raised relative to the index of the pedestal.

In some embodiments at least one of the at least one erbium doped fiber sections has a photonic crystal fiber core. Photonic crystal fiber cores enable engineering of the index of refraction profile of the core beyond the limits usually possible with conventional cores. In conventional erbium doped fibers it is very difficult to create large mode area LMA fibers because the erbium doping in the core which is necessary to achieve amplification causes a large index step with respect to the cladding index. This large step index in turn makes the fiber numerical aperture high which for larger core diameters causes the core to be multimode. By engineering a photonic crystal core erbium doped fiber to have a smaller index step between the core and the cladding fewer modes will be supported with proper engineering such as described in commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 7 260 299 which is incorporated herein by reference a single mode is supported leading to better beam quality. In some embodiments the erbium doping pump pulsing and L band signal wavelengths are used in the various structures systems and methods described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 260 299 and when so combined these combinations form embodiments of the present invention.

In some embodiments at least one of the at least one erbium doped fiber sections has a flattened mode profile. Typical conventional optical fibers have mode profiles that resemble Gaussian shapes with high intensity near the center of the core falling off to lower intensity approaching the edge of the core. By tailoring the index profile some embodiments provide a flatter shape to the signal mode which then resembles a super Gaussian or flat top shape. In some embodiments the present invention uses fiber profiles such as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 556 658 titled APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR A WAVEGUIDE WITH AN INDEX PROFILE MANIFESTING A CENTRAL DIP FOR BETTER ENERGY EXTRACTION by John D. Minelly et al which is incorporated herein by reference.

In some embodiments a length of the fiber in the power amplifier stage s corresponds to absorption of between 300 dB and 2000 dB of small signal inversion at the wavelength of peak absorption e.g. small signal inversion denoting a normalized length with respect to erbium concentration for example if the 1530 nm absorption in a fiber is 50 dB m then 300 dB 2000 dB of small signal inversion translates to absolute lengths of the power amplifier fiber of between 6 and 40 m .
