Relationships among entities such as businesses and customers may be developed or improved by personalizing communications among target recipients of messages or other communication items shared among the entities. For example many businesses recognize that personalized customer service may encourage customers to continue and expand a business relationship over time thus driving new growth and helping the business to achieve or maintain competitive agility.

As an example customer relationship management CRM may involve acquiring and retaining customers or other types of business partners improving loyalty and gaining insight among such business partners and implementing strategies focused on such customers or business partners.

Developing personalized communications may involve obtaining information regarding target recipients of messages. For example a business may obtain personal information regarding customers or potential customers such as their name contact information purchase history and or personal preferences. Further the business may obtain information associated with data items such as products that the customers or potential customers may find interesting. The business may then develop marketing campaigns or newsletters that may be personalized for each individual target recipient based on the obtained information. Such information may more conveniently be presented to a reader via a table such as a product table. However some target recipients may prefer to receive communication items via a plain text based communication medium such as fax or plain text email messages and thus table formatting provided by markup language representations of tables may not provide feasible representations for viewing.

Thus it may be desirable to provide techniques for generating data item tables in plain text table structured views.

According to one general aspect a system includes a plain text table manager including a template manager configured to obtain a hierarchical template including table information associated with a table the table information formatted in accordance with a non proprietary markup language format a parsing engine configured to parse the table information associated with the table to determine one or more markup language elements associated with the table a plain text layout engine configured to determine a plain text graphical table structured layout associated with the table based on the one or more markup language elements and a graphical table structure generator configured to generate a plain text graphical table structured view of the table indicating one or more data items indicated by the table information.

According to another aspect a method includes obtaining a hierarchical template including table information associated with a table the table information formatted in accordance with a non proprietary markup language format. The method further includes parsing the table information associated with the table to determine one or more markup language elements associated with the table. The method further includes determining a plain text graphical table structured layout associated with the table based on the one or more markup language elements and generating a plain text graphical table structured view of the table indicating one or more data items indicated by the table information.

According to yet another aspect a computer program product may be tangibly embodied on a computer readable medium and may be configured to cause a data processing apparatus to obtain a hierarchical template including table information associated with a table the table information formatted in accordance with a non proprietary markup language format parse the table information associated with the table to determine one or more markup language elements associated with the table determine a plain text graphical table structured layout associated with the table based on the one or more markup language elements and generate a plain text graphical table structured view of the table indicating one or more data items indicated by the table information.

For example the external agencies may receive data files with the extracted customer data and may send out personalized communication items based on this data. As another example the external agencies may contact members of the target group via calls or personal visits based on the extracted data.

Implementations of the various techniques described herein may be implemented in digital electronic circuitry or in computer hardware firmware software or in combinations of them. Implementations may implemented as a computer program product i.e. a computer program tangibly embodied in an information carrier e.g. in a machine readable storage device or in a propagated signal for execution by or to control the operation of data processing apparatus e.g. a programmable processor a computer or multiple computers. A computer program such as the computer program s described above can be written in any form of programming language including compiled or interpreted languages and can be deployed in any form including as a stand alone program or as a module component subroutine or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.

Method steps may be performed by one or more programmable processors executing a computer program to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output. Method steps also may be performed by and an apparatus may be implemented as special purpose logic circuitry e.g. an FPGA field programmable gate array or an ASIC application specific integrated circuit .

Processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include by way of example both general and special purpose microprocessors and any one or more processors of any kind of digital computer. Generally a processor will receive instructions and data from a read only memory or a random access memory or both. Elements of a computer may include at least one processor for executing instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally a computer also may include or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to or both one or more mass storage devices for storing data e.g. magnetic magneto optical disks or optical disks. Information carriers suitable for embodying computer program instructions and data include all forms of non volatile memory including by way of example semiconductor memory devices e.g. EPROM EEPROM and flash memory devices magnetic disks e.g. internal hard disks or removable disks magneto optical disks and CD ROM and DVD ROM disks. The processor and the memory may be supplemented by or incorporated in special purpose logic circuitry.

To provide for interaction with a user implementations may be implemented on a computer having a display device e.g. a cathode ray tube CRT or liquid crystal display LCD monitor for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device e.g. a mouse or a trackball by which the user can provide input to the computer. Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well for example feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback e.g. visual feedback auditory feedback or tactile feedback and input from the user can be received in any form including acoustic speech or tactile input.

Implementations may be implemented in a computing system that includes a back end component e.g. as a data server or that includes a middleware component e.g. an application server or that includes a front end component e.g. a client computer having a graphical user interface or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an implementation or any combination of such back end middleware or front end components. Components may be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication e.g. a communication network. Examples of communication networks include a local area network LAN and a wide area network WAN e.g. the Internet.

While certain features of the described implementations have been illustrated as described herein many modifications substitutions changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments.
