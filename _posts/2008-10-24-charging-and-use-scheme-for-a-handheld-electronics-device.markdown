title: Charging and use scheme for a hand-held electronics device
abstract: One embodiment sets forth a method for modifying video content stored on a hand-held digital video camera (DVC). The method includes transmitting video data to a computer system to which the hand-held DVC is coupled via a data connector, receiving a request for a set of instructions related to a processing operation being performed on the computer system and involving the video data, transmitting the set of instructions to the computer system via the data connector. The method also includes drawing power from the computer system via the data connector and charging at least in part a battery associated with the hand-held DVC with the power drawn from the computer system, where the hand-held DVC remains coupled to the computer system via the data connector for the steps of transmitting, receiving, drawing and charging.
