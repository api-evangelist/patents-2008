This application claims priority under 35 USC 119 from Japanese patent Application Nos. 2007 185795 2007 220226 and 2008 009317 the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein.

The present invention relates to photosensitive compositions curable compositions curable compositions for color filters color filters and methods for production thereof. The invention also relates to novel oxime compounds photopolymerizable compositions photopolymerizable compositions for color filters color filters and methods for production thereof solid state imaging devices and planographic printing plate precursors.

Photosensitive or photopolymerizable compositions may include for example an ethylenic unsaturated bond containing polymerizable compound and a photopolymerization initiator. Such photosensitive or photopolymerizable compositions polymerize and cure when they are irradiated with light and are therefore used for for example photosetting inks photosensitive printing plates color filters and a variety of photoresists.

In other types of photosensitive or photopolymerizable compositions for example an acid is generated upon application of light and the acid serves as a catalyst. Specifically such compositions may be used in materials for image formation anti counterfeiting or detection of energy ray dose in which a color reaction of a pigment precursor in the presence of the generated acid serving as a catalyst is used or may be used for positive resists for use in manufacture of semiconductors TFTs color filters micromachine components and the like in which a decomposition reaction in the presence of the generated acid serving as a catalyst is used.

In recent years photosensitive or photopolymerizable compositions sensitive to shorter wavelength 365 nm or 405 nm light sources have been demanded in various applications and demands for such compounds e.g. photopolymerizable initiators capable of exhibiting high sensitivity to such short wavelength light sources have been increasing. However highly sensitive photopolymerization initiators are generally poor in stability. Therefore there is a demand for photopolymerization initiators having both of improved sensitivity and stability over time.

Under the circumstances it is proposed to use oxime ester derivatives as photopolymerization initiators for photosensitive or photopolymerizable compositions for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 255 513 and 4 590 145 and Japanese Patent Application Laid Open JP A Nos. 2000 80068 and 2001 233842. However these known oxime ester compounds have low absorbance at a wavelength of 365 nm or 405 nm and are not satisfactory in terms of sensitivity.

At present there have been a demand for photosensitive or photopolymerizable compositions having not only high stability over time but also high sensitivity to light with a short wavelength such as 365 nm or 405 nm.

For example JP A No. 2006 195425 discloses a colored radiation sensitive composition for color filters that contains an oxime compound. However the stability over time and short wavelength sensitivity of such a composition is still insufficient. There have also been a demand for colored radiation sensitive compositions having improved reproducibility of hue after pattern formation and suppression of change in coloring property over time has been strongly demanded.

On the other hand there have been a demand for color filters for image sensors having high color concentrations and small thicknesses in order to enhance the light gathering power of solid state imaging devices such as CCDs and in order to improve the image quality by improving color separation properties. If a large amount of a coloring material is added to achieve a high color concentration the sensitivity may be insufficient for faithful reproduction of the shape of a fine image pattern of 2.5 m or less so that pattern defects can frequently occur over the product. In order to avoid such defects photo irradiation has to be performed with higher energy which requires a long exposure time and leads to a significant reduction in manufacturing yield. Under the circumstances there have been a demand for colored radiation sensitive compositions for color filters having a high content of a coloring material colorant and also having high sensitivity in order to achieve excellent pattern forming property.

It is an object of the present invention to provide a photosensitive composition and a curable composition having high sensitivity to light with a wavelength of 365 nm or 405 nm and having high stability over time.

If the mass ratio is lower than it can be difficult to inhibit the light transmittance in the range of 400 nm to 450 nm so that color purity cannot be heightened in some cases. If the ratio is higher than 150 100 the dominant wavelength can be shifted to the longer wavelength side so that a relatively large deviation from the NTSC target hue can be observed in some cases. In particular the mass ratio is preferably in the range of from 30 100 to 120 100.

Specifically the curable composition for a color filter of the invention is applied to a support substrate directly or with another layer interposed therebetween to form a photopolymerizable composition layer the colored curable composition layer forming step the coating film is exposed to light through a specific patterned mask to cure the irradiated portion of the coating film the exposure step and the coating film is developed with a liquid developer to form a patterned film including pixels of the respective colors three or four colors so that the color filter of the invention is produced.

In the colored curable composition layer forming step the curable composition for a color filter of the invention is applied to a support to form a colored curable composition layer.

Examples of the support that may be used in this step include soda glass substrates PYREX registered trademark glass substrates quartz glass substrates and a substrate obtained by attaching a transparent electrically conductive film onto any of the above glass substrates which are for use in liquid crystal displays and the like and photoelectric converting substrates for use in imaging devices such as silicon substrates and complementary metal oxide film semiconductors CMOS . In some cases these substrates may have black stripes that separate pixels from one another.

If necessary an undercoat layer may be formed on the support in order to improve adhesion to the upper layer prevent the substance diffusion or flatten the substrate surface.

The curable composition for a color filter of the invention may be applied to the support by various coating methods such as slit coating inkjet method spin coating cast coating roll coating and screen printing.

The thickness of the coating film of the curable composition is preferably from 0.1 m to 10 m more preferably from 0.2 m to 5 m even more preferably from 0.2 m to 3 m.

The coating of the curable composition for a color filter on the support is generally dried under the conditions of 70 to 110 C. for 2 to 4 minutes to form a colored curable composition layer.

In the exposure step the colored curable composition layer formed in the colored curable composition layer forming step is exposed to light through a mask so that only the irradiated portion of the coating film is cured.

The exposure is preferably performed by irradiation with a radiation. In particular ultraviolet rays such as g line or i line is preferably used as the radiation for exposure and high pressure mercury lamps are more preferred. The irradiation intensity is preferably from 5 mJ to 1500 mJ more preferably from 10 mJ to 1000 mJ most preferably from 10 mJ to 800 mJ.

After the exposure step alkali development the development step may be performed so that the unexposed portion resulting from the exposure step can be dissolved in an aqueous alkali solution. In this step only the photo cured portion is left.

The liquid developer is preferably an organic alkali developer that does not damage underlying circuits or the like. The development is generally performed at a temperature of 20 C. to 30 C. for a time period of 20 to 90 seconds.

The photopolymerizable composition of the invention includes A the novel oxime compound and B a polymerizable compound.

The photopolymerizable composition of the invention has high sensitivity to light with a wavelength of 365 nm or 405 nm and also has high stability over time. In addition it can form a cured film in which coloration caused by heating over time can be suppressed. Although the detailed mechanism is not clear the novel oxime compound has a structure that can inhibit radical recombination when cleaved by light absorption so that it can produce a relatively large amount of radicals to achieve high sensitivity. Since radical recombination is inhibited it is considered that the reaction between the decomposition product molecules of the novel oxime compound can be suppressed during heating over time thereby suppressing coloration caused by the reaction.

In the colored photopolymerizable composition layer forming step the photopolymerizable composition for a color filter of the invention is applied to a support to form a colored photopolymerizable composition layer.

Examples of the support that may be used in this step include soda glass substrates PYREX registered trademark glass substrates quartz glass substrates and a substrate obtained by attaching a transparent electrically conductive film onto any of the above glass substrates which are for use in liquid crystal displays and the like and photoelectric converting substrates for use in imaging devices such as silicon substrates and complementary metal oxide film semiconductors CMOS . In some cases these substrates may have black stripes for separating pixels from one another.

If necessary an undercoat layer may be formed on the support in order to improve adhesion to the upper layer prevent the substance diffusion or flatten the substrate surface.

The photopolymerizable composition for a color filter of the invention may be applied to the support by various coating methods such as slit coating inkjet method spin coating cast coating roll coating and screen printing.

The thickness of the coating film of the photopolymerizable composition for a color filter is preferably from 0.1 m to 10 m more preferably from 0.2 m to 5 m even more preferably from 0.2 m to 3 m.

When producing a color filter for use in a solid state imaging device the thickness of the coating film of the photopolymerizable composition for a color filter is preferably from 0.35 m to 1.5 m more preferably from 0.40 m to 1.0 m in view of resolution and developability.

The coating of the photopolymerizable composition for a color filter on the support is generally dried under the conditions of 70 to 110 C. for 2 to 4 minutes to form a colored photopolymerizable composition layer.

In the exposure step the colored photopolymerizable composition layer formed in the colored photopolymerizable composition layer forming step is exposed to light through a mask so that only the irradiated portion of the coating film is cured.

The exposure is preferably performed by irradiation with a radiation. In particular ultraviolet rays such as g line or i line is preferably used as the radiation for exposure and high pressure mercury lamps are more preferred. The irradiation intensity is preferably from 5 mJ to 1500 mJ more preferably from 10 mJ to 1000 mJ most preferably from 10 mJ to 800 mJ.

After the exposure step alkali development the development step may be performed so that the unexposed portion resulting from the exposure step can be dissolved in an aqueous alkali solution. In this step only the photo cured portion is left.

The liquid developer is preferably an organic alkali developer that does not damage underlying circuits or the like. The development is generally performed at a temperature of 20 C. to 30 C. for a time period of 20 to 90 seconds.

Examples of the alkali for use in the liquid developer include ammonia water and organic alkaline compounds such as ethylamine diethylamine dimethylethanolamine tetramethylammonium hydroxide tetraethylammonium hydroxide choline pyrrole piperidine and 1 8 diazabicyclo 5 4 0 7 undecene. An aqueous alkaline solution prepared by diluting the alkali with pure water to a concentration of 0.001 to 10 by mass preferably of 0.01 to 1 by mass may be used. When a liquid developer comprising such an aqueous alkaline solution is used washing rinsing with pure water is generally performed after the development.

If necessary the method of the invention for producing a color filter may further include the step of curing the colored pattern by heating and or exposure to light after the photopolymerizable composition layer forming step the exposure step and the development step have been conducted.

The colored photopolymerizable composition layer forming step the exposure step and the development step and optionally the curing step may be repeated for the number of times corresponding to the number of the desired hues whereby a color filter of the desired hues may be produced.

While the method of the invention for producing a color filter has been described based on an exemplary embodiment where the photopolymerizable composition for a color filter of the invention is used in a process of forming a colored pattern of a color filter such an exemplary embodiment is not intended to limit the scope of the invention. For example the photopolymerizable composition for a color filter of the invention may also be used to form black matrices for separating colored patterns pixels in a color filter.

The colored photopolymerizable composition layer forming step the exposure step and the development step and optionally the curing step of the color filter production method of the invention may also be used in a process of forming a black matrix on a substrate. Specifically the colored photopolymerizable composition layer forming step the exposure step and the development step and optionally the curing step are performed as described above using the photopolymerizable composition for a color filter of the invention containing a black colorant such as carbon black or black titanium oxide so that a black matrix black pattern is formed on the substrate.

The color filter of the invention is produced with the photopolymerizable composition for a color filter of the invention. In the color filter therefore the colored pattern exhibits excellent adhesion to the supporting substrate and the cured composition has excellent resistance to development. Therefore the exposure sensitivity is high the adhesion to the substrate of the exposed portion is excellent and a high resolution pattern having a desired cross sectional shape can be formed. Therefore the color filter of the invention is suitable for use in liquid crystal displays and solid state imaging devices such as CCDs and particularly suitable for use in high resolution CCD devices or CMOS devices having more than a million pixels. Specifically the color filter of the invention is preferably used for solid state imaging devices.

For example the color filter of the invention may be placed between the light receiving part of each pixel of a CCD and a converging microlens.

The planographic printing plate precursor includes a support and a photosensitive layer that is placed on the support and contains the photopolymerizable composition of the invention.

If necessary the planographic printing plate precursor may further include any other layer such as a protective layer and an intermediate layer. Since the planographic printing plate precursor contains the photopolymerizable composition of the invention in the photosensitive layer and thus have a high sensitivity stability over time and printing durability. Each element of the planographic printing plate precursor of the invention is described below.

The photosensitive layer is a layer containing the photopolymerizable composition of the invention. Specifically the photosensitive layer may be formed by a process that includes using the photopolymerizable composition 2 a preferred example of the photopolymerizable composition of the invention as a composition for forming a photosensitive layer hereinafter also referred to as the photosensitive layer forming composition applying a coating liquid containing the composition to a support and dying the coating to form a photosensitive layer.

For the application of the photosensitive layer forming composition to the support the respective components to be contained in the composition may be used in the form of solutions in various organic solvents. Examples of solvents that may be used in this process include acetone methyl ethyl ketone cyclohexane ethyl acetate ethylene dichloride tetrahydrofuran toluene ethylene glycol monomethyl ether ethylene glycol monoethyl ether ethylene glycol dimethyl ether propylene glycol monomethyl ether propylene glycol monoethyl ether acetyl acetone cyclohexanone diacetone alcohol ethylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate ethylene glycol ethyl ether acetate ethylene glycol monoisopropyl ether ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate 3 methoxypropanol methoxymethoxyethanol diethylene glycol monomethyl ether diethylene glycol monoethyl ether diethylene glycol dimethyl ether diethylene glycol diethyl ether propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate propylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate 3 methoxypropyl acetate N N dimethylformamide dimethylsulfoxide butyrolactone methyl lactate and ethyl lactate. Only a single solvent may be used or a mixture of two or more solvents may be used. The coating solution appropriately has a solids content of 2 to 50 by mass.

The coating amount of the photosensitive layer on the support is preferably selected as appropriate depending on applications because it may have effects on the sensitivity and or developability of the photosensitive layer and on the strength and or printing durability of the exposed film. If the coating amount is too small the printing durability may be insufficient. If the coating amount is too large the sensitivity may be reduced so that the necessary exposure time may increase and the development time may also undesirably increase. For a main object of the invention namely for a planographic printing plate for scanning exposure the coating amount in terms of the mass after drying may be appropriately from 0.1 g mto 10 g m more preferably from 0.5 g mto 5 g m.

In the planographic printing plate precursor of the invention the support preferably has a hydrophilic surface. The hydrophilic support may be selected from known conventional hydrophilic supports used for planographic printing plates without particular limitations.

The support is preferably a dimensionally stable plate shaped material examples of which include paper paper laminated with plastic such as polyethylene polypropylene or polystyrene a metal plate such as of an aluminum zinc or copper plate a plastic film such as a film of cellulose diacetate cellulose triacetate cellulose propionate cellulose butyrate cellulose acetate butyrate cellulose nitrate polyethylene terephthalate polyethylene polystyrene polypropylene polycarbonate or polyvinyl acetal and paper or a plastic film on which metal such as those listed above is laminated or vapor deposited. If necessary the surface of these materials may be subjected to an appropriate known physical and or chemical treatment for the purpose of imparting hydrophilicity improving strength or the like.

Paper a polyester film or an aluminum plate is preferred as the support. The aluminum plate is particularly preferred because it has excellent dimensional stability is relatively inexpensive and can provide a highly hydrophilic or strong surface by being subjected to surface treatment that may be conducted as necessary. A composite sheet comprising a polyethylene terephthalate film and an aluminum sheet bonded thereto as described in JP B No. 48 18327 is also preferable.

Preferred examples of the aluminum plate include a pure aluminum plate and a plate of an aluminum alloy comprising aluminum as the main component and a small amount of other elements. A plastic film on which aluminum is laminated or vapor deposited may also be used. Examples of such other elements to be contained in aluminum alloys include silicon iron manganese copper magnesium chromium zinc bismuth nickel and titanium. The content of foreign elements in the alloy is at most 10 by mass or less. In the invention pure aluminum is particularly preferred. However it is difficult to produce completely pure aluminum in terms of refinement technology and therefore trace amounts of other elements may be contained. The aluminum plate for use in the invention is not limited to have a particular composition and may be appropriately selected from aluminum plates of any known conventional material. The aluminum plate for use in the invention preferably may have a thickness of about 0.1 mm to about 0.6 mm preferably of 0.15 mm to 0.4 mm particularly preferably of 0.2 mm to 0.3 mm.

When the support has a metallic surface specifically an aluminum surface it preferably has undergone surface treatment such as surface roughening graining immersion into an aqueous solution of sodium silicate potassium fluorozirconate phosphate or the like or anodic oxidation.

Surface roughening of the aluminum plate may be performed by various methods such as methods of mechanically roughening the surface methods of electrochemically dissolving and roughening the surface and methods of chemically and selectively dissolving the surface. The mechanical roughening may be a known mechanical method such as ball polishing brush polishing blast polishing and buff polishing. Electrochemical surface roughening methods may be performed in an electrolytic solution of hydrochloric acid nitric acid or the like under alternating or direct current. A combination of both methods may also be used in combination as disclose in JP A No.54 63902. Prior to roughening of the surface of the aluminum plate if necessary degreasing with a surfactant an organic solvent or an aqueous alkaline solution may be performed to remove rolling oil from the surface.

An aluminum plate that has undergone immersion in an aqueous sodium silicate solution after surface roughening is preferably used. An aluminum plate that has undergone the processes of anodic oxidation of the aluminum plate and immersion in an aqueous alkali metal silicate solution as described in JP B No. 47 5125 may also preferably be used. For example the anodic oxidation may be performed by allowing a current to flow through the aluminum plate serving as an anode in an electrolyte solution containing one or more of aqueous or nonaqueous solutions of inorganic acids such as phosphoric acid chromic acid sulfuric acid and boric acid organic acids such as oxalic acid and sulfamic acid or salts thereof.

The surface treatment disclosed in JP B No. 46 27481 and JP A Nos. 52 58602 and 52 30503 is also useful which uses an electrolytically grained support in combination with the anodic oxidation and sodium silicate treatment.

In a preferred treatment mechanical surface roughening chemical etching electrolytic graining anodic oxidation and sodium silicate treatment are sequentially performed as described in JP A No. 56 28893.

After these treatments undercoating may be preferably performed. The undercoating may include a water soluble resin such as polyvinyl phosphonic acid a polymer or copolymer having a sulfonic acid group in a side chain or polyacrylic acid a water soluble metal salt such as zinc borate a yellow dye or an amine salt.

A sol gel treated substrate is also preferably used in which a functional group capable of undergoing a radical addition reaction is covalently bonded as disclosed in JP A No. 07 154983.

In another preferred example a water resistant hydrophilic layer may be formed as a surface layer on an arbitrary support. Examples of such a surface layer include a layer comprising an inorganic pigment and a binding agent as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3 055 295 and JP A No. 56 13168 a hydrophilic swelling layer as described in JP A No. 09 80744 and a sol gel film of titanium oxide polyvinyl alcohol or silicates as described in Japanese Patent Application National Publication Laid Open No. 08 507727.

These hydrophilizing treatments may be performed not only to hydrophilize the surface of the support but also to prevent an undesirable reaction of the photopolymerizable composition to be provided thereon and to improve adhesion of the photosensitive layer.

The planographic printing plate precursor of the invention preferably further includes a protective layer on the photosensitive layer. The protective layer can prevent low molecular compounds such as basic substances or oxygen in the air which inhibits image forming reaction in the photosensitive layer caused by exposure to light from entering the photosensitive layer and enables exposure in the air. Therefore the protective layer preferably has such characteristics that the protective layer is less permeable to low molecular compounds such oxygen does not substantially inhibit transmission of light for exposure is excellent in adhesion property to the photosensitive layer and is easily removable by a development process after exposure.

Improvements of the protective layer have been made as described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 3 458 311 and JP A No.55 49729. For example water soluble polymer compounds having relatively high crystallinity may be preferably used for the protective layer. Examples of such materials include water soluble polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol polyvinylpyrrolidone acidic celluloses gelatin gum arabic and polyacrylic acid. In particular the best result in terms of basic characteristics such as oxygen barrier characteristics and removability by development can be obtained using polyvinyl alcohol as a main component.

Polyvinyl alcohol for use in the protective layer may be partially substituted by at least one of an ester an ether and an acetal as long as it has an unsubstituted vinyl alcohol unit for imparting necessary oxygen barrier characteristics and water solubility. The polyvinyl alcohol may partially have at least one other copolymerization component. Specifically the polyvinyl alcohol may be hydrolyzed to a degree of 71 to 100 mol and may have a mass average molecular weight in the range of 300 to 2400. Examples of the polyvinyl alcohol include PVA 105 PVA 110 PVA 117 PVA 117H PVA 120 PVA 124 PVA 124H PVA CS PVA CST PVA HC PVA 203 PVA 204 PVA 205 PVA 210 PVA 217 PVA 220 PVA 224 PVA 217EE PVA 217E PVA 220E PVA 224E PVA 405 PVA 420 PVA 613 and L 8 manufactured by Kuraray Co. Ltd.

The components choice of PVAs use of additives and the like the coating amount and the like of the protective layer may be selected in consideration of on oxygen barrier characteristics removability by development fogging adhesion property or scratch resistance. In general a higher rate of hydrolysis of the PVA to be used a higher content of unsubstituted vinyl alcohol units in the protective layer or a larger thickness of the film leads to a higher level of oxygen barrier characteristics which is advantageous in terms of sensitivity. When oxygen barrier characteristics are increased excessively problems may occur such as unnecessary polymerization reactions during manufacture or storage and unnecessary fogging or thickening of image lines during imagewise exposure. The adhesion to the image portion and the scratch resistance are also very important for the handleability of the printing plate. Methods for applying the protective layer are described in detail in for example U.S. Pat. No. 3 458 313 and JP A No. 55 49729.

The protective layer may also have another function. For example a colorant such as a water soluble dye capable of efficiently transmitting light in the range of 350 nm to 450 nm to be used for exposure and efficiently absorbing light at 500 nm or more may be added to the protective layer so that safe light suitability can be further improved without a reduction in sensitivity.

Other layers such as layers for improving adhesion between the photosensitive layer and the support and layers for improving the removability of the unexposed photosensitive layer by development may also be provided. For example the adhesion or the printing durability may be improved by adding a diazonium structure containing compound or a compound capable of relatively strongly interacting with the substrate such as phosphonic compounds or by providing an undercoat layer of such a compound. On the other hand the developability of the non image portion or the antifouling properties may be improved by adding a hydrophilic polymer such as polyacrylic acid or polysulfonic acid or by providing an undercoat layer of such a polymer.

In general the planographic printing plate precursor is imagewise exposed to light and then the unexposed portion is removed by using a liquid developer to form an image.

Any known light exposure method may be applied to the planographic printing plate precursor of the invention without limitations. The wavelength of the light source is preferably from 350 nm to 450 nm and specifically InGaN semiconductor lasers are preferred. The exposure mechanism may be of any system such as an internal drum system an external drum system or a flathead system. A highly water soluble component may be used for the photosensitive layer so that the layer can dissolved in neutral water or weakly alkaline water. The planographic printing plate having such a constitution may be subjected to on press exposure and development after mounted on a printing machine.

Gas lasers include Ar ion lasers 364 nm 351 nm 10 mW to 1 W Kr ion lasers 356 nm 351 nm 10 mW to 1 W and He Cd lasers 441 nm 325 nm 1 to 100 mW Solid state lasers include a combination of Nd YAG YVO and SHG crystal twice 355 nm 5 mW to 1 W and a combination of Cr LiSAF and SHG crystal 430 nm 10 mW Semiconductor lasers include KNbOring resonators 430 nm 30 mW a combination of a waveguide type wavelength converting device and an AlGaAs or InGaAs semiconductor 380 to 450 nm 5 to 100 mW a combination of a waveguide type wavelength converting device and an AlGaInP or AlGaAs semiconductor 300 to 350 nm 5 to 100 mW and AlGaInN lasers 350 to 450 nm 5 to 30 mW Other lasers include pulsed lasers such as Nlasers 337 nm 0.1 to 10 mJ pulse and XeF lasers 351 nm 10 to 250 mJ pulse .

Above all AlGaInN semiconductor lasers commercially available InGaN semiconductor lasers 400 to 410 nm 5 to 30 mW are particularly preferred in view of wavelength characteristics and cost.

For scanning exposure type planographic printing plate exposure systems internal drum external drum or flathead systems may be used as exposure mechanisms and all of the light sources describe above except for pulsed lasers may be used as light sources. Practically the exposure systems described below are particularly preferred in view of the relationship between the sensitivity of the material and plate making time.

A single beam exposure system of an internal drum system using a single gas or solid state laser source 

A multi beam exposure system of a flathead system using a number of ten or more semiconductor lasers and

A multi beam exposure system of an external drum system using a number of ten or more semiconductor lasers.

For laser direct drawing type planographic printing plates as described above the equation eq1 X S n q t is generally established wherein X J cm is the sensitivity of the photosensitive material S cm is the exposed area of the photosensitive material q W is the power of one laser light source n is the number of the laser light sources and t s is the total exposure time.

In the case of i the internal drum system single beam the equation eq2 f Z t Lx is generally established wherein f radian s is the rotational frequency of the laser Lx cm is the sub scanning length of the photosensitive material Z dots cm is the resolution and t s is the total exposure time.

In the case of ii the external drum system multi beam the equation eq3 F Z n t Lx is generally established wherein F radian s is the rotational frequency of the drum Lx cm is the sub scanning length of the photosensitive material Z dots cm is the resolution t s is the total exposure time and n is the number of the beams.

In the case of iii the flathead system multi beam the equation eq4 H Z n t Lx is generally established wherein H radian s is the rotational frequency of the polygon mirror Lx cm is the sub scanning length of the photosensitive material Z dots cm is the resolution t s is the total exposure time and n is the number of the beams.

Substitution of the resolution 2560 dpi required of a practical printing plate the size of the plate A1 B1 42 inches in sub scanning length the exposure condition of about 20 sheets per hour and the photosensitive characteristics of the photopolymerizable composition of the invention the photosensitive wavelength and a sensitivity of about 0.1 mJ cm into the equations suggests that the photosensitive material of the invention should preferably be used in combination with a semiconductor laser of a multi beam exposure type. Also taking handleability and cost into account it is suggested that the photosensitive material of the invention is most preferably used in combination with a semiconductor laser multi beam exposure system of an external drum system.

Other examples of light sources that may be used for exposure include any of ultra high pressure high pressure medium pressure and low pressure mercury lamps chemical lamps carbon arc lamps xenon lamps metal halide lamps a variety of visible and ultraviolet laser lamps fluorescent lamps tungsten lamps and sunlight.

Liquid developers suitable for the planographic printing plate precursor of the invention include the developers described in JP B No. 57 7427. Appropriate developers include aqueous solutions of inorganic alkaline agents such as sodium silicate potassium silicate sodium hydroxide potassium hydroxide lithium hydroxide sodium tertiary phosphate sodium secondary phosphate ammonium tertiary phosphate ammonium secondary phosphate sodium metasilicate sodium bicarbonate and ammonia water and aqueous solutions of organic alkaline agents such as monoethanolamine and diethanolamine. The alkaline agent may be added such that the alkaline solution may have a concentration of 0.1 to 10 by mass preferably of 0.5 to 5 by mass.

If necessary the alkaline aqueous solution may contain a small amount of a surfactant or an organic solvent such as benzyl alcohol 2 phenoxyethanol or 2 butoxyethanol. Examples of such additives include those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 375 171 and 3 615 480.

The liquid developers described in JP A Nos. 50 26601 and 58 54341 and JP B Nos. 56 39464 and 56 42860 are also excellent.

The liquid developer described in JP A No. 2002 202616 is particularly preferred which contains a nonionic compound represented by Formula VIII and has a pH of 11.5 to 12.8 and a conductivity of 3 to 30 mS cm. A W Formula VIII 

In Formula VIII A represents such a hydrophobic organic group that A H has a log P of 1.5 or more and W represents such a nonionic hydrophilic organic group that W H has a log P of less than 1.0.

The components of the liquid developer are described in detail in Paragraphs 0024 to 0067 of JP A No. 2002 202616.

It is effective to add the nonionic compound represented by Formula VIII such that its concentration in the liquid developer becomes 0.1 to 15 by mass preferably of 1.0 to 8.0 by mass.

If necessary the process of making a printing plate from the planographic printing plate precursor may further include heating the whole surface before or during exposure or between exposure and development. Such heating can facilitate the image forming reaction in the photosensitive layer so that advantages such as an increase in sensitivity or printing durability and stabilization of sensitivity can be achieved. In addition whole surface exposure or whole surface post heating may be effectively performed on the image after the development in order to improve the strength or printing durability of the image. In general heating before the development is preferably performed under mild conditions at 150 C. or lower. At 150 C. or lower the non image portion can be free of the problem of fogging. Very strong conditions should be used for heating after the development. Such conditions are generally in the range of 200 to 500 C. At 200 C. or higher the image strengthening effect can be sufficiently obtained. At 500 C. or lower problems such as deterioration of the support and thermal decomposition of the image portion do not occur.

The area of 50 halftone dots was measured with a dot area measuring meter Gretag Macbeth . A greater member indicates a higher sensitivity.

Printing with the planographic printing plate precursor was performed using an printing machine R201 trade name manufactured by Roland DG Corporation and GEOS G N ink manufactured by Dainippon Ink and Chemicals Incorporated. The solid image portion of each print was observed the number of the prints obtained until the image began to fade was used to determine the printing durability. A greater number indicates a higher printing durability.

Each planographic printing plate precursor was sealed with aluminum kraft paper and interleaf paper and allowed to stand at 60 C. for 4 days. Thereafter the dot area was measured by the same method as in the evaluation of the sensitivity. The difference between the dot area after being left for 4 days at 60 C. and the dot area before being left for 4 day at 60 C. was calculated so that the change in dot area by forced aging was determined. When the absolute value of the number is smaller it is suggested that the influence of the forced aging is smaller namely the stability over time is higher.

Table 14 above indicates that the planographic printing plate precursor of each of Examples 7 1 to 7 7 containing the novel oxime compound of the invention in the photosensitive layer showed a high level of sensitivity stability over time and printing durability.

In contrast the sensitivity stability over time and printing durability of the planographic printing plate precursor of each of the Comparative Examples 7 1 to 7 3 were all lower than those of the planographic printing plates of Examples.

Polymerizable Compounds M N and O and Binder Polymers B1 B2 and B3 shown in Table 14 have the structures shown below.

The composition 1 shown below was subjected to a high viscosity dispersion process with two rolls to form a dispersion with a viscosity of 70 000 mPa s.

The composition 2 shown below was then added to the dispersion and the mixture was stirred with a homogenizer at 3 000 rpm for 3 hours. The resulting mixture solution was subjected to a micro dispersion process for 4 hours in a dispersing machine trade name DISPERMAT manufactured by Getzmann with 0.3 mm zirconia beads so that a carbon black dispersion liquid A hereinafter referred to as CB dispersion liquid A was prepared. In this process the mixture solution had a viscosity of 37 mPa s.

The composition 3 shown below was subjected to a high viscosity dispersion process with two rolls to form a dispersion liquid with a viscosity of 40 000 mPa s.

Optionally kneading with a kneader may be performed for 30 minutes before the high viscosity dispersion process.

The composition 4 shown below was then added to the resulting dispersion and the mixture was stirred with a homogenizer at 3 000 rpm for 3 hours. The resulting mixture solution was subjected to a micro dispersion process for 4 hours in a dispersing machine trade name DISPERMAT manufactured by Getzmann with 0.3 mm zirconia beads so that a black titanium oxide dispersion liquid A hereinafter referred to as TB dispersion liquid A was prepared.

The components for the composition E a shown below were mixed in a mixer to form each of black photopolymerizable compositions E 1 to E 14 and E 1 to E 8.

The components for the composition E b shown below were mixed in an agitator to form each of black photopolymerizable compositions E 15 to E 24 and E 9 to E 16.

The resulting black photopolymerizable composition E 1 to E 24 and E 1 to E 16 were each evaluated as described below. The results are summarized and shown in Tables 15 and 16.

The exposure sensitivity of each of the black photopolymerizable compositions E 1 to E 24 and E 1 to E 16 was determined and evaluated by the method described below.

Each of the black photopolymerizable compositions E 1 to E 24 and E 1 to E 16 was used and uniformly applied to a silicon wafer by spin coating at a rotational speed that was controlled such that the thickness of the coating would be 1.0 m after the coating was subjected to heat treatment on a hot plate at a surface temperature of 120 C. for 120 seconds conducted after the coating.

The resulting 1.0 m thick coating film was exposed to light from an i line stepper trade name FPA 3000iS manufactured by Canon Inc. at different exposure amounts in the range of 10 mJ cmto 5 100 mJ cmthrough a mask having a 10 nm L S line and space pattern.

After the exposure the coating film was subjected to a paddle development process at 23 C. for 60 seconds with an aqueous solution of 0.3 tetramethylammonium hydroxide TMAH . The film was then rinsed with pure water for 20 seconds by spin shower and further washed with pure water. Thereafter the deposited droplets of water were removed with high speed air and the substrate was naturally dried so that a black patterned image was obtained.

Each of the resulting colored patterned images was evaluated with an optical microscope according to the criteria below.

The minimum exposure amount at which the post development thickness of the region that was irradiated with light in the exposure step became 95 or more of the thickness 100 of the film before the exposure was measured and evaluated as the exposure requirement amount.

The stability over time storage stability of the resulting black photopolymerizable compositions E 1 to E 24 and E 1 to E 16 was evaluated by the method described below.

After the black photopolymerizable compositions E 1 to E 24 and E 1 to E 16 were each stored at room temperature for one month the degree of precipitation of matters was visually evaluated according to the following criteria 

The developability of the resulting black photopolymerizable compositions E 1 to E 24 and E 1 to E 16 was evaluated by the method described below.

The presence or absence of residues in the region unexposed portion which was not irradiated with light in the exposure step for the sensitivity evaluation was observed so as to evaluate the developability. The evaluation was preformed according to the following criteria 

Tables 15 and 16 indicate that the black photopolymerizable composition of each Example containing the novel oxime compound has high storage stability stability over time . It is also apparent that these black photopolymerizable compositions have high sensitivity at exposure and high developability of unexposed portions as compared with the comparative examples and thus can form excellent black patterns colored patterns even with a relatively low exposure amount.
