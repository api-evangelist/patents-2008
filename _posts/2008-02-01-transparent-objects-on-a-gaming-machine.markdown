Additionally the display unit may include a three dimensional display unit such as a holographic display a stereoscopic display a three dimensional display volume etc.

If the gaming unit provides a slots game having a plurality of reels and a plurality of paylines which define winning combinations of reel symbols the control panel may be provided with a plurality of selection buttons each of which allows the player to select a different number of paylines prior to spinning the reels. For example five buttons may be provided each of which may allow a player to select one three five seven or nine paylines.

If the gaming unit provides a slots game having a plurality of reels the control panel may be provided with a plurality of selection buttons each of which allows a player to specify a wager amount for each payline selected. For example if the smallest wager accepted by the gaming unit is a quarter 0.25 the gaming unit may be provided with five selection buttons each of which may allow a player to select one two three four or five quarters to wager for each payline selected. In that case if a player were to activate the 5 button meaning that five paylines were to be played on the next spin of the reels and then activate the 3 button meaning that three coins per payline were to be wagered the total wager would be 3.75 assuming the minimum bet was 0.25 .

The control panel may include a Max Bet button to allow a player to make the maximum wager allowable for a game. In the above example where up to nine paylines were provided and up to five quarters could be wagered for each payline selected the maximum wager would be 45 quarters or 11.25. The control panel may include a spin button to allow the player to initiate spinning of the reels of a slots game after a wager has been made.

In a rectangle is shown around the buttons . It should be understood that that rectangle simply designates for ease of reference an area in which the buttons may be located. Consequently the term control panel should not be construed to imply that a panel or plate separate from the housing of the gaming unit is required and the term control panel may encompass a plurality or grouping of player activatable buttons.

Although one possible control panel is described above it should be understood that different buttons could be utilized in the control panel and that the particular buttons used may depend on the game or games that could be played on the gaming unit . Although the control panel is shown to be separate from the display unit it should be understood that the control panel could be generated by the display unit . In that case each of the buttons of the control panel could be a colored area generated by the display unit and some type of mechanism may be associated with the display unit to detect when each of the buttons was touched such as a touch sensitive screen.

Although the program memory is shown in as a read only memory ROM the program memory of the controller may be a read write or alterable memory such as a hard disk. In the event a hard disk is used as a program memory the address data bus shown schematically in may comprise multiple address data buses which may be of different types and there may be an I O circuit disposed between the address data buses.

As shown in the components may be connected to the I O circuit via a respective direct line or conductor. Different connection schemes could be used. For example one or more of the components shown in may be connected to the I O circuit via a common bus or other data link that is shared by a number of components. Furthermore some of the components may be directly connected to the microprocessor without passing through the I O circuit .

The graphics processor may be a processor such as a conventional graphics processor configured to convert graphical primitives into display information that can be shown on the display unit . Graphical primitives may include for example points lines polygons etc. The graphics processor maybe a KYRO II or KYRO III graphics and video accelerator commercially available from STMICROELECTRONICS Inc a GEFORCE2 graphics processing unit commercially available from NVIDIA Corporation a RADEON 7000 graphics processor commercially available from ATI Technologies Inc. etc.

Although the microprocessor and the graphics processor are shown as separate devices in it should be noted that such a representation is merely exemplary and that the functionality of both devices could be incorporated into a single device. For example the microprocessor could perform some or all of the operations carried out by the graphics processor .

In a system employing 3D graphics a scene to be displayed may be composed in a 3D model space also referred to herein as 3D graphics space . The scene may include a plurality of 3D objects. These 3D objects may be composed of a plurality of geometric primitives that help define the object s surface. Such primitives may include for instance points lines polygons etc. As an example the OpenGL graphics application programming interface promulgated by OpenGL Architecture Review Board provides various types of primitives that may be employed such as points lines line strips line loops polygons quadrilaterals polygon strips triangles triangle strips and triangle fans.

A 3D cube may comprise for example of six quadrilateral primitives corresponding to the six surfaces of the cube. A polygon that is extensively used in typical 3D graphics systems is the triangle. Thus as another example the 3D cube may comprise triangle primitives where each of the six surfaces of the cube comprises two triangles. By using an appropriate number of primitives such as triangles objects may be made to appear round spherical tubular etc. Complex objects such as a human body may be composed of numerous primitives.

Primitives in the 3D model space may be indicated by the coordinates of their vertices. For example a point may be indicated by its 3D coordinates. Also a line may be indicated by two sets of 3D coordinates corresponding to its two endpoints. Similarly a triangle may be indicated by three sets of 3D coordinates corresponding to its three comers. Primitives in the 3D model space may also be indicated by a primitive type e.g. point line triangle quadrilateral etc. . The 3D model space may be described using a rectangular coordinate system or another coordinate system such as a spherical coordinate system or a cylindrical coordinate system.

Attributes may be assigned to objects or primitives in the 3D model space. Attributes may include color pattern reflectance transparency translucency animation texture etc. Textures may include smoothness surface irregularities such as bumps craters etc. and may also include the mapping of text an image bitmap animation video etc. onto the object or primitive.

Model space can be viewed from various viewpoints such as viewpoints and . To display a depiction of model space on a display unit a view point maybe chosen and a depiction of the model space as viewed from that viewpoint may be generated.

A typical technique for generating a depiction of the model space from a particular viewpoint is to project the model space onto a virtual display. For example if the viewpoint is to be viewed on a 2D display such as a monitor the model space or a portion thereof may be projected onto a virtual 2D display. illustrate an example of objects and in 3D model space being projected onto a virtual 2D display . Typically the projection of an object in 3D model space onto a 2D virtual screen is implemented by projecting 3D primitives of which it is comprised. Typically a mathematical transform is applied to the 3D coordinates of each primitive s vertices to generate the 2D coordinates of the projection s vertices on the virtual 2D display . Thus application of the mathematical transform may generate primitives in a 2D space hereinafter 2D primitives . Additional computations may be performed to generate the effects of light sources if any in 3D space on the color luminance etc. associated with the generated 2D primitives. These mathematical transformations may be included in a 3D graphics processing step typically known to those of ordinary skill in the art as Transform and Lighting. illustrates the projection of cube onto the virtual display . In this example the projection comprises two polygons and . Because the virtual display is a 2D space polygons and can be indicated by sets of 2D coordinates.

The Transform and Lighting processing step generally may produce data including information relating to 2D primitives. This data relating to a 2D primitive may include the 2D coordinates of its vertices the primitive s color luminance etc.

The data may also include depth information of the primitive in terms of the 3D model space and the viewpoint. This depth information can help determine whether a particular primitive or part of the primitive is blocked from view by another primitive. Referring again to depth may increase going into the 3D space from the virtual display . Thus object maybe at a greater depth than object . Similarly the depth information associated with projected polygon may indicate a greater depth than that of polygons and . Therefore if object is opaque polygon is hidden and may not be displayed on the display unit.

The data relating to a 2D primitive may also include transparency information such as a value that indicates the degree of transparency of the primitive. In some typical 3D graphic systems a primitive s alpha value indicates the degree of the primitive s transparency. Frequently the alpha value may be between the values 0 and 1 inclusive where for example a 0 indicates the primitive is completely transparent and a 1 indicates the primitive is completely opaque. In other 3D graphics systems the transparency information may merely include a flag that indicates whether or not the primitive is transparent and the degree of transparency is the same for all transparent primitives. For example the degree of transparency may be fixed at 50 for transparent objects. In 3D graphics systems that employ alpha values a technique often referred to as alpha blending may be used to generate a display in which an object appears to be transparent when viewed on the display unit.

Referring now to A and B two examples of graphics processors that may be used in the gaming unit are illustrated. illustrates a graphics processor A configured to receive information relating to 2D primitives from for example microprocessor . The graphics processor A may generate one or more control signals for driving display unit . With the graphics processor A the transform and lighting step may be implemented for example with the microprocessor . Optionally graphics processors A and B may be configured to receive an overlay input. The overlay input may be used to provide an image that is to overlay a base image. Additionally graphics processors A and B may be configured to optionally overlay the image such that it appears transparent.

Details of 3D graphical techniques that may be used are described in OpenGL Reference Manual The Official Reference Document to Open GL Version 1.2 3edition Dave Shreiner editor OpenGL Architecture Review Board Addison Wesley Publishing Co. 1999 ISBN 0201657651 and OpenGL Programming Guide The Official Guide to Learning OpenGL Version 1.2 3edition Mason Woo et al. editors OpenGL Architecture Review Board Addison Wesley Publishing Co. 1999 ISBN 0201604582 which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.

Additional detail pertinent to 3D graphics is available in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09 927 901 Client Reference No. P 557 entitled Virtual Cameras and 3 D Gaming Environments in a Gaming Machine filed Aug. 9 2001 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

One manner in which one or more of the gaming units and one or more of the gaming units may operate is described below in connection with a number of flowcharts which represent a number of portions or routines of one or more computer programs which may be stored in one or more of the memories of the controller . The computer programs or portions thereof may be stored remotely outside of the gaming unit and may control the operation of the gaming unit from a remote location. Such remote control may be facilitated with the use of a wireless connection or by an Internet interface that connects the gaming unit with a remote computer such as one of the network computers having a memory in which the computer program portions are stored. The computer program portions may be written in any high level language such as C C C or the like or any low level assembly or machine language. By storing the computer program portions therein various portions of the memories are physically and or structurally configured in accordance with computer program instructions.

During performance of the attraction sequence if a potential player makes any input to the gaming unit as determined at block the attraction sequence may be terminated and a game selection display maybe generated on the display unit at block to allow the player to select a game available on the gaming unit . The gaming unit may detect an input at block in various ways. For example the gaming unit could detect if the player presses any button on the gaming unit the gaming unit could determine if the player deposited one or more coins into the gaming unit the gaming unit could determine if player deposited paper currency into the gaming unit etc.

The game selection display generated at block may include for example a list of video games that may be played on the gaming unit and or a visual message to prompt the player to deposit value into the gaming unit . While the game selection display is generated the gaming unit may wait for the player to make a game selection. Upon selection of one of the games by the player as determined at block the controller may cause one of a number of game routines to be performed to allow the selected game to be played. For example the game routines could include a video poker routine a video blackjack routine a slots routine a video keno routine and a video bingo routine . At block if no game selection is made within a given period of time the operation may branch back to block .

After one of the routines has been performed to allow the player to play one of the games block may be utilized to determine whether the player wishes to terminate play on the gaming unit or to select another game. If the player wishes to stop playing the gaming unit which wish may be expressed for example by selecting a Cash Out button the controller may dispense value to the player at block based on the outcome of the game s played by the player. The operation may then return to block . If the player did not wish to quit as determined at block the routine may return to block where the game selection display may again be generated to allow the player to select another game.

It should be noted that although five gaming routines are shown in a different number of routines could be included to allow play of a different number of games. The gaming unit may also be configured to allow play of different games.

During performance of the attraction sequence if a potential player makes any input to the gaming unit as determined at block the attraction sequence may be terminated and a game display may be generated on the display unit at block . The game display generated at block may include for example an image of the casino game that may be played on the gaming unit and or a visual message to prompt the player to deposit value into the gaming unit . At block the gaming unit may determine if the player requested information concerning the game in which case the requested information may be displayed at block . Block may be used to determine if the player requested initiation of a game in which case a game routine maybe performed. The game routine could be any one of the game routines disclosed herein such as one of the five game routines or another game routine.

After the routine has been performed to allow the player to play the game block may be utilized to determine whether the player wishes to terminate play on the gaming unit . If the player wishes to stop playing the gaming unit which wish may be expressed for example by selecting a Cash Out button the controller may dispense value to the player at block based on the outcome of the game s played by the player. The operation may then return to block . If the player did not wish to quit as determined at block the operation may return to block .

At block the routine may determine if the player desires a new hand to be dealt which may be determined by detecting if the Deal Draw button was activated after a wager was made. In that case at block a video poker hand may be dealt by causing the display unit to generate the playing card images . After the hand is dealt at block the routine may determine if any of the Hold buttons have been activated by the player in which case data regarding which of the playing card images are to be held may be stored in the controller at block . If the Deal Draw button is activated again as determined at block each of the playing card images that was not held may be caused to disappear from the video display and to be replaced by a new randomly selected playing card image at block .

At block the routine may determine whether the poker hand represented by the playing card images currently displayed is a winner. That determination may be made by comparing data representing the currently displayed poker hand with data representing all possible winning hands which may be stored in the memory of the controller . If there is a winning hand a payout value corresponding to the winning hand may be determined at block . At block the player s cumulative value or number of credits may be updated by subtracting the bet made by the player and adding if the hand was a winner the payout value determined at block . The cumulative value or number of credits may also be displayed in the display area .

Although the video poker routine is described above in connection with a single poker hand of five cards the routine may be modified to allow other versions of poker to be played. For example seven card poker may be played or stud poker may be played. Alternatively multiple poker hands may be simultaneously played. In that case the game may begin by dealing a single poker hand and the player may be allowed to hold certain cards. After deciding which cards to hold the held cards may be duplicated in a plurality of different poker hands with the remaining cards for each of those poker hands being randomly determined.

To allow the player to control the play of the video blackjack game a plurality of player selectable buttons may be displayed. The buttons may include a Cash Out button a See Pays button a Stay button a Hit button a Bet One Credit button and a Bet Max Credits button . The display may also include an area in which the number of remaining credits or value is displayed. If the display unit is provided with a touch sensitive screen the buttons may form part of the video display . Alternatively one or more of those buttons may be provided as part of a control panel that is provided separately from the display unit .

At block the player may be allowed to be hit in which case at block another card will be dealt to the player s hand by making another playing card image appear in the display . If the player is hit block may determine if the player has bust or exceeded . If the player has not bust blocks and may be performed again to allow the player to be hit again.

If the player decides not to hit at block the routine may determine whether the dealer should be hit. Whether the dealer hits may be determined in accordance with predetermined rules such as the dealer always hit if the dealer s hand totals 15 or less. If the dealer hits at block the dealer s hand may be dealt another card by making another playing card image appear in the display . At block the routine may determine whether the dealer has bust. If the dealer has not bust blocks may be performed again to allow the dealer to be hit again.

If the dealer does not hit at block the outcome of the blackjack game and a corresponding payout may be determined based on for example whether the player or the dealer has the higher hand that does not exceed 21. If the player has a winning hand a payout value corresponding to the winning hand may be determined at block . At block the player s cumulative value or number of credits may be updated by subtracting the bet made by the player and adding if the player won the payout value determined at block . The cumulative value or number of credits may also be displayed in the display area .

To allow the player to control the play of the slots game a plurality of player selectable buttons may be displayed. The buttons may include a Cash Out button a See Pays button a plurality of payline selection buttons each of which allows the player to select a different number of paylines prior to spinning the reels a plurality of bet selection buttons each of which allows a player to specify a wager amount for each payline selected a Spin button and a Max Bet button to allow a player to make the maximum wager allowable.

If the Spin button has been activated by the player as determined at block at block the routine may cause the slot machine reel images to begin spinning so as to simulate the appearance of a plurality of spinning mechanical slot machine reels. At block the routine may determine the positions at which the slot machine reel images will stop or the particular symbol images that will be displayed when the reel images stop spinning. At block the routine may stop the reel images from spinning by displaying stationary reel images and images of three symbols for each stopped reel image . The virtual reels may be stopped from left to right from the perspective of the player or in any other manner or sequence. After the routine stops the reel images are block paylines associated with winning symbols combinations may be generated and displayed to the user at block .

The payline generation routine which is described in further detail in conjunction with is responsible for generating 3 D representations of the paylines that overlay game displays. Additionally the payline generation routine converts the 3 D representations into 2 D graphics that may be presented to a user on the display . Although by way of example the payline generation routine is shown as being called between blocks and it will be readily appreciated that the payline generation routine could be called at any other point in the routine . Additionally the payline generation routine could be called more than just once at different locations in the routine . For example the payline generation routine could be called at any location at which it is desirable to display paylines to the user.

The routine may provide for the possibility of a bonus game or round if certain conditions are met such as the display in the stopped reel images of a particular symbol . If there is such a bonus condition as determined at block the routine may proceed to block where a bonus round may be played. The bonus round may be a different game than slots and many other types of bonus games could be provided. If the player wins the bonus round or receives additional credits or points in the bonus round a bonus value may be determined at block . A payout value corresponding to outcome of the slots game and or the bonus round may be determined at block . At block the player s cumulative value or number of credits may be updated by subtracting the bet made by the player and adding if the slot game and or bonus round was a winner the payout value determined at block .

Although the above routine has been described as a virtual slot machine routine in which slot machine reels are represented as images on the display unit actual slot machine reels that are capable of being spun maybe utilized instead.

Alternatively one or more of those buttons may be provided as part of a control panel that is provided separately from the display unit .

Referring to at block the routine may determine whether the player has requested payout information such as by activating the See Pays button in which case at block the routine may cause one or more pay tables to be displayed on the display unit . At block the routine may determine whether the player has made a bet such as by having pressed the Bet One Credit button or the Bet Max Credits button in which case at block bet data corresponding to the bet made by the player may be stored in the memory of the controller . After the player has made a wager at block the player may select a keno ticket and at block the ticket may be displayed on the display . At block the player may select one or more game numbers which may be within a range set by the casino. After being selected the player s game numbers may be stored in the memory of the controller at block and may be included in the image on the display at block . After a certain amount of time the keno game may be closed to additional players where a number of players are playing a single keno game using multiple gambling units .

If play of the keno game is to begin as determined at block at block a game number within a range set by the casino may be randomly selected either by the controller or a central computer operatively connected to the controller such as one of the network computers . At block the randomly selected game number may be displayed on the display unit and the display units of other gaming units if any which are involved in the same keno game. At block the controller or the central computer noted above may increment a count which keeps track of how many game numbers have been selected at block . At block the controller or one of the network computers may determine whether a maximum number of game numbers within the range have been randomly selected. If not another game number may be randomly selected at block . If the maximum number of game numbers has been selected at block the controller or a central computer may determine whether there are a sufficient number of matches between the game numbers selected by the player and the game numbers selected at block to cause the player to win. The number of matches may depend on how many numbers the player selected and the particular keno rules being used.

If there are a sufficient number of matches a payout may be determined at block to compensate the player for winning the game. The payout may depend on the number of matches between the game numbers selected by the player and the game numbers randomly selected at block . At block the player s cumulative value or number of credits may be updated by subtracting the bet made by the player and adding if the keno game was won the payout value determined at block . The cumulative value or number of credits may also be displayed in the display area .

If any player has bingo as determined at block the routine may determine at block whether the player playing that gaming unit was the winner. If so at block a payout for the player may be determined. The payout may depend on the number of random numbers that were drawn before there was a winner the total number of winners if there was more than one player and the amount of money that was wagered on the game. At block the player s cumulative value or number of credits may be updated by subtracting the bet made by the player and adding if the bingo game was won the payout value determined at block . The cumulative value or number of credits may also be displayed in the display area .

Examples of techniques for generating paylines will now be described. For ease of explanation these examples are described in the context of a reel type slot machine game. It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art however that paylines can be used in other games as well. For example techniques similar to those described below can be used to generate paylines in games such as checkers and Othello to indicate how a player won the game.

The image or images of slot reels need not be mapped onto the face of an object . For example the images of slot reels could be mapped onto a plane.

Rather the payline may include sharp vertices.

Additionally although in the embodiment described above the generated payline is located in one plane in 3D model space the payline could have a different structure. For example one segment of the payline may lie in a first plane and a second segment may lie in a second plane different than the first plane. In these embodiments a location in the payline in which is to be generated may be determined for example by examining the direction of lines between reference points gradients between reference points etc. Also the payline or a portion thereof may be curved in 3D model space with a segment not lying in one plane.
