title: POD launched unmanned air vehicle
abstract: A method and apparatus for attacking a plurality of dispersed targets are herein presented. In particular, the method and apparatus herein presented allow the user to upload target data onto a pod mounted on a host aircraft. Upon reaching the pre loaded target location, the pod releases a plurality of individually targeted Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs), thereby allowing the user to attack a plurality of dispersed targets from a single aircraft standing off at a significant distance from the target area.

This application claims rights under 35 U.S.C. 119 e from U.S. Application Ser. No. 60 936 024 filed Jun. 18 2007 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

This invention was made with United States Government support. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.

The present invention relates to ordnance and more particularly to ordnance applications of unmanned aerial vehicles UAVs .

In modern warfare especially in counter terrorism operations adversaries may tend to dispense their assets. It may therefore be necessary to attack a plethora of targets from a single aircraft standing off at a significant distance from the target area.

The present invention is a method and apparatus for attacking dispersed targets from a single aircraft standing off at a significant distance from the target area. According to this invention pods of individually targeted UAVs are carried in lieu of a bomb on a conventional bomb rack.

Referring to in a preferred embodiment of this invention pod modules would be ejectable Micro Air Vehicle MAV with suitable payloads. The pod modules could also be delivered ballistically with chaff flares weapons or sensors. Fixed modules which stays with the pod may be communications RF uplink downlink and ECM. The pod modules may be single or double or triple wide. They may for example be 20 single wide modules per pod. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that a module to module interlink would be provided by conventional means such as a CAN bus. Other than attachment points no interface is necessary to the carrying aircraft. The pod has its own GPS and initiates function when the pod enters the preplanned operations area.

Potential MAV payloads would include weapons such as High Explosive utility armor piercing anti personnel anti personnel mines chemical and incendiaries. Suitable payloads would also include decoys or chaff sensors. Such sensors could include visible light and infra red acoustic seismic or magnetic. Other suitable payloads would include chemical weapons or psychological operations devices or materials.

Referring to a maximum vertical velocity Micro Air Vehicle MAV is shown which is an unpowered aerospike with a 2 1 length to diameter ratio. Maximum range would be from 10 000 feet AGL 4 miles. Vz Max would be 0.8 Mach. The MAW would drop 10 000 feet AGL in about 20 seconds straight down to 120 seconds at 4 miles maximum range . An example of a suitable payload for use with this embodiment would be a M77 shaped charge.

Referring to a maximum range maximum endurance MAV is shown. It would be unpowered and have a 14 1 length to diameter ratio and a range from 10 000 feet AGL 28 miles. Vz Typical would be 5 ft sec Vh 80 ft sec . The MAW would drop 10 000 feet AGL in about hour. An example of a suitable payload would be a jammer.

Delivery modes for the UAV of this invention include endurance glide fast glide attack glide and slow drive glide and fast drive and unguided ballistic.

Referring to in one preferred embodiment of the present invention the UAV may be used in a endurance glide. Typical payloads include sensors jammers decoys and COM crosslink. Guidance might be GPS only or multiple waypoints. Required accuracy would be in hundreds of meters. A special advantage would be that the MAV would achieve programmed waypoints even in winds enabling precise geometry between payload and target.

Referring to in our alternate embodiment of the present invention the UAV may be used in a fast glide attack. A typical payload would include weapons. Suitable guidance would be by means of laser designation. The required accuracy would be 1 meter. A special advantage of this embodiment would be that it would be well suited to attack moving targets car truck boat another UAV or to attack vertical faces side of building cave entrance .

Referring to in another alternate embodiment of the present invention the UAV may be used in a fast glide attack. Typical payloads would include sensors or weapons such as an M77. Guidance could be by means of GPS glide or GPS and or laser designator dive. The required accuracy would be 100 m to a meter. Special advantages would be that it could land on roof camo netting or ground without penetrating. A GPS glide GPS dive is true fire and forget weapon.

Referring to in another alternate embodiment of the present invention the UAV may be used in a glide and fast dive mode. Typical payloads would include a sensor such as planting a seismic sensor or a weapon. Guidance could be GPS guide or laser designator dive. The required accuracy would be from 100 m to 2 m. A special advantage of this embodiment would be that it could penetrate some types of roofs and camo netting. It could also be used in ground attack of moving targets at greater range than fast glide.

Referring to in another alternate embodiment of the present invention the UAV could be employed in a ballistic mode. Typical payloads could be an en masse payload such a several dozen M 77 s. No guidance would be required. Required accuracy would be 1000 m to 100 m. A special advantage of this embodiment would be its ultra low cost delivery.

While the present invention has been described in connection with the preferred embodiments of the various figures it is to be understood that other similar embodiments may be used or modifications and additions may be made to the described embodiment for performing the same function of the present invention without deviating therefrom. Therefore the present invention should not be limited to any single embodiment but rather construed in breadth and scope in accordance with the recitation of the appended claims.
