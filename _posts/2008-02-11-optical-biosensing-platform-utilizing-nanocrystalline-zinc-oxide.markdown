This application claims benefit of prior filed U.S. Provisional Patent Application Entiled A Novel Approach of Using Nanocrystalline Zinc Oxide as an Optical Sensing Platform Ser. No. 60 994 160 filed Sep. 11 2007 and fully incorporated by reference herein.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by the U.S. Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.

The invention relates to a novel optical biosensing platform in general and more particularly to an optical biosensing platform utilizing surface modified nanocrystalline zinc oxide for the real time detection of the occurrence of a binding event.

There are various optical biosensing platforms which are currently used to identify the occurrence of a binding event between biomolecules e.g. between a receptor and a ligand.

One of these optical biosensing platforms combines the use of biomolecules and a biosensing substrate e.g. a high surface area material wherein the biosensing substrate is used to provide an optical signal resulting from the binding event. For example porous silicon cast films have been used as biosensing substrates because of their ease of fabrication inherent optical properties porosity and the ability to chemically functionalize silicon. More particularly the porosity of the silicon substrate increases the available surface area for the attachment of receptors.

The surface of porous silicon cast films can be chemically derivatized to introduce various reactive groups e.g. NH COOH SH etc. in order to enable covalent immobilization of biomolecules. These immobilization techniques retain the activity and long term stability of the biomolecules. By way of example but not limitation biomolecules such as enzymes DNA proteins cells and lipopolysaccharide components etc. have all been successfully immobilized to porous silicon for use in the capture of specific analytes. When using porous silicon substrates the occurrence of specific binding events is measured and or identified by variations in refractive index shifts in reflectance ellipsometry and or photoluminescence etc.

While porous silicon may be used as an optical biosensing platform its use is hindered by the need to tailor the pore size of the silicon in order to accommodate a specific receptor ligand pair of interest. In addition to the time required to prepare a specific pore size and platform for each receptor ligand pair of interest the steric hindrance imposed by the porous structure limits the usable surface area available for receptor ligand pair binding. Together these disadvantages significantly complicate the process of using porous silicon as an optical biosensing platform.

In addition to silicon substrate platforms other techniques exist for optically detecting binding events. Some optical biosensing techniques such as those associated with magnetic nanoparticles utilize an indirect approach for detecting binding events. These techniques require labeling one or more of the biomolecules e.g. receptors ligands etc. with a fluorescent reporter tag molecule. Subsequently the tagged biomolecule is passed through an appropriate optical reader in order to detect whether a binding event has occurred.

These techniques have numerous disadvantages including increased complexity lengthy sample preparation techniques time consuming analysis and limited sensitivity.

Accordingly there is a need for an optical biosensing platform wherein the pore size does not need to be tailored for a specific receptor ligand pair and which also overcomes the limitations associated with fluorescent tagging.

Nano ZnO has the desirable qualities indicated above e.g. large surface area mechanical and thermal stability and an inherent photoluminescence signal.

Nano ZnO is presently used as a wide band gap semiconductor due to its potential applications in the areas of photonics electronics and sensors. For example nano ZnO has been used as a gas sensor by monitoring changes in its electrical resistivity.

In addition nano ZnO has been used as a biosensor platform wherein the binding of a target analyte is detected using a variety of techniques. These include obtaining electrical measurements monitoring changes in conductivity using quantum dots incorporating optical dyes and or measuring changes in the optical density of ZnO.

The photoluminescence signal inherent to as grown ZnO nanostructures consists of two emission peaks. One of the peaks is emitted within the ultraviolet UV region and the other peak is emitted within the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum . The presence of these two distinct photoluminescent PL emission bands i.e. ultraviolet and visible make it desirable to use nano ZnO as a potential real time optical biosensing platform. More particularly a surface binding event induces a change e.g. in emission intensities in emission maxima shifts and or in peak proportionalities etc. within the inherent photoluminescent PL properties of nano ZnO. This change can then be used to detect the binding event of a specific target ligand to the surface of the nano ZnO. Thus nano ZnO eliminates the need for fluorescent labeling and provides an opportunity to detect real time binding events through UV or visible peak emission intensity changes emission maximum shifts and peak proportionality changes.

However in order to detect the binding of a specific target ligand the surface of the nano ZnO must first be functionalized with an appropriate receptor. Moreover through the process of functionalizing the nano ZnO surface it is possible that the inherent photoluminescent PL properties of nano ZnO may be adversely affected. By way of example previous studies have shown that surface alterations to nano ZnO generally stabilize the ultraviolet UV emission but typically diminish the visible emission. This results in the loss of the versatility of the two distinct inherent emission peaks of nano ZnO and functionality as an optical biosensor platform is thereby significantly decreased. Furthermore those surface altered ZnO nanostructures have not introduced any level of chemical functionality and therefore are not satisfactory techniques in the development of nano ZnO based optical biosensors.

There is thus a need for an optical biosensor platform which remedies the aforementioned shortcomings of the current platforms in use.

An object of the invention is therefore to provide an optical biosensor platform which addresses and overcomes the limitations associated with the prior art.

These and other objects are addressed by the provision and use of the present invention which provides a novel optical biosensing platform utilizing surface modified nanocrystalline ZnO.

In one form of the present invention there is provided an optical biosensing platform for the real time detection of the occurrence of a binding event the optical biosensing platform comprising 

a nanocrystalline zinc oxide nano ZnO substrate having a surface and being capable of emitting photoluminescence and

a surface modifier formed integral with at least a portion of the surface of the nano ZnO substrate wherein the surface modifier is capable of binding to a biomolecule 

wherein when the surface modifier binds with a biomolecule a change is induced in the emitted photoluminescent properties of the nano ZnO substrate thereby enabling the detection of a binding event.

In another form of the present invention there is provided a method for detecting the occurrence of a binding event the method comprising 

providing a sample which potentially contains at least one biomolecule capable of binding with the surface modifier and

observing the nano ZnO substrate to determine whether a change in the photoluminescent properties of nano ZnO substrate has been induced thereby enabling the detection of a binding event.

In another form of the present invention there is provided a method for manufacturing an optical biosensing platform for the real time detection of the occurrence of a binding event the method comprising 

providing a nanocrystalline zinc oxide nano ZnO substrate having a surface and being capable of emitting photoluminescence and

integrating the surface modifier with at least a portion of the surface of the nano ZnO substrate wherein the surface modifier is capable of binding to a specific biomolecule.

The above and other features of the invention including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. It will be understood that the optical biosensing platform embodying the invention is shown by way of illustration only and not as a limitation of the invention. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.

The present invention comprises an optical biosensing platform utilizing surface modified nanocrystalline zinc oxide for the real time detection of the occurrence of a binding event.

Looking now at in one form of the present invention optical biosensing platform comprises a nano ZnO substrate and a receptor wherein receptor is formed integral with the surface of nano ZnO substrate thereby creating a surface modified nano ZnO substrate.

The surface modified nanocrystalline zinc oxide nano ZnO substrate of the present invention provides surface functionalization i.e. a receptor ligand binding site while still maintaining the inherent bimodal photoluminescent PL properties of zinc oxide.

Significantly the present invention utilizes covalent surface modification to achieve the desired chemical functionality needed for subsequent biomolecular and or chemical attachment. The surface modifiers are chosen to covalently attach specific molecular recognition elements e.g. receptors which allow for the binding of particular target analytes or ligands. By way of example but not limitation the surface modifiers may attach antibodies peptides aptamers DNA enzymes proteins cells lipopolysaccharides etc. This provides real time sensing based upon detecting induced changes after ligand binding within the inherent photoluminescence emission peaks without the need to use secondary fluorescent labels or other chemical processes.

In a preferred embodiment the present invention utilizes ZnO nanopowders which have i a wide band gap material with a high exciton binding energy e.g. 60 meV ii a large surface area for biological and or chemical functionalization and iii an inherent ability to co generate two photoluminescence emission peaks. As stated above one of the two photoluminescence emission peaks is located within the ultraviolet UV spectrum due to near band edge emission and the other photoluminescence emission peak is located within the visible green region due to oxygen vacancies caused by crystalline defects. Since a binding event will induce a change in the emission of the inherent photoluminescent PL spectrum of the ZnO nanopowder it is possible to detect this change and therefore the presence of a surface binding event. See .

In the preferred embodiment the nano ZnO can be derivatized with a variety of surface modifiers in order to obtain the desired chemical reactivity for subsequent biomolecule covalent attachment. One example of a surface modifier which can be used in accordance with the present invention is a silane cross linking agent e.g. triethoxysilylundecanal. In this embodiment and looking now at the silane agent creates a Zn O Si bond at the surface of the ZnO nanopowder and introduces an amine reactive aldehyde group at the other end of a 10 carbon spacer. The amine reactive aldehyde group introduces a chemical functionality that allows coupling of biomolecules containing primary amino groups e.g. a fluorescent dye hydrazide derivative biotin peptides etc. to the surface of the ZnO.

In order to create the Zn O Si bond at the surface of the ZnO nanopowder an aqueous alcohol deposition technique may be used to provide for simultaneous surface hydrolysis and organosilane condensation steps.

In addition to the silane linker discussed above which incorporates an amine reactive aldehyde other linkers such as but not limited to different organosilane linkers e.g. 3 mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane and or isocyanate containing molecules e.g. N p maleimidophenyl isocyanate may be available to introduce alternative reactive groups. This could include multiplexing through the deposition of several linkers at one time to introduce multiple reactive groups and to provide supplementary attachment sites to bind a series of target biomolecules.

The inherent optical responses of the surface modified nano ZnO can then be obtained by known techniques and converted into a digital readout for real time detection of biological or chemical threats.

As stated above the surface functionalization i.e. surface modification of nano ZnO induces a change in the photoluminescent spectrum of nano ZnO specifically to the ultraviolet UV emission peak. More particularly the cross linking agent causes a stable and reproducible enhancement of ultraviolet UV emission which can be as high as 3 times greater than the un modified nano ZnO material. More importantly and in contrast to the prior art this enhancement is made while still retaining the inherent visible emission intensity of the nano ZnO. This has not previously been achieved in a post nanocrystal growth modification process.

In the preferred embodiment and as shown in the surface modified nanocrystalline zinc oxide of the present invention is modified on the surface and not within a cavity. This avoids pore size complications such as those encountered when using the porous silicon substrates of the prior art.

It is important to note that since nano ZnO possesses two inherent PL emission peaks i.e. one in the UV region and one in the visible region there is a greater opportunity for a surface binding event to induce emission intensity changes emission maximum shifts and peak intensity proportionality changes than there is for materials that possess only one photoluminescent PL peak or than those materials which must be labeled with unstable fluorescent taggants.

Additionally due to the inherent photoluminescent PL properties of nanocrystalline ZnO structures the optical biosensing platform of the present invention can be probed via optical characterization techniques for direct detection of a binding event. This is in contrast to the indirect detection techniques of the prior art which require labeling with photo reactive moieties. The present invention thus avoids the increased complexity and instability associated with sample preparation and photo instability of fluorescent dyes which are required in the indirect labeling and detection techniques of the prior art.

Another method of probing changes in the inherent photoluminescent PL properties of nano ZnO involves the measurement of photoluminescent PL lifetimes. Whereas photoluminescence PL spectroscopic measurements represent a composite photoluminescence PL response lifetime measurements represent individual electronic events which can be influenced by the immediate environment of the nano ZnO and hence may be an alternative approach to detecting binding events.

By way of example but not limitation the ZnO nanocystals may also be probed with lasing and diffraction techniques for detecting induced optical changes. More particularly ZnO nanocrystals have been shown to exhibit room temperature lasing capabilities. The lasing action of the ZnO is due to resonant cavities formed by multiple scattering and interference events. Light becomes confined in these resonant cavity regions resulting in recurrent scattering which then provides coherent feedback in closed loop paths inducing lasing in the material. Since lasing ability of the crystals has been correlated to particle size binding of recognition elements to the ZnO may induce changes in the lasing characteristics of the nanocrystals. Furthermore investigation of diffraction patterns may be possible since particle size will increase upon a binding event which can cause changes to the baseline white light diffraction. Both lasing and diffraction techniques would be best served by an aligned zinc oxide nanoarray.

In addition to the foregoing the nano ZnO optical biosensing platform of the present invention can provide enhanced sensitivity over current sensor platforms as well as a durable stable reagent less device. This may result in real time chemical biological CB detection with a reduction in the use of consumables reduced footprint and elimination of lengthy sample preparation. The attachment of multiple molecular recognition elements to the powders could lead to unique shifts in inherent photoluminescent spectra to not only detect the presence of pathogens but also to provide pathogen identification.

Potential benefits for the military could be a sensor device capable of generating a real time signal in a hand held or integrated textile platform. The present invention may also be significant to Homeland Defense initiatives with emphasis on soldier food and or water quality and safety.

The optical biosensing ZnO nanocrystals of the present invention may be used in a variety of applications. The tailoring of nano ZnO surface chemistries may also allow for the incorporation of nano ZnO into various electro optical devices of interest to the military such as short wavelength light emitting diodes diode lasers and optical sensors which may be operative and stable in a variety of environments.

In summary through the introduction of chemical functionality and retention of reactivity the present invention creates a platform for forming biomolecular complexes on the nano ZnO surface. The optically responsive biosensing platform of the present invention can serve as a template for immobilizing biomolecular recognition elements MREs including antibodies aptamers enzymes peptides etc. Although the silane linker discussed herein introduced an amine reactive aldehyde other linkers could also be employed to introduce alternative reactive groups. The introduction of other linkers could facilitate multiplexing through deposition of several different linkers at once to introduce multiple reactive groups and to immobilize MREs specific to a series of target ligands.

A heterobifunctional organosilane linker 11 triethoxysilylundecanal was covalently attached to a nano ZnO surface to introduce an amine reactive functional group that would allow for biofunctionalization. Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy EDS mapping of silicon atoms verified the presence of the cross linking agent and analysis confirmed a high concentration of Si on the nanorod surface. After organosilane surface modification a series of washing steps ensured removal of any noncovalently attached silane agent. Because noncovalently attached Si atoms were removed during the washing process EDS confirmed both the presence of the silane agent and covalent attachment. Analysis of the surface modified nano ZnO indicated that the complex is remarkably stable with no silane dissociation after more than six months in storage at room temperature within a desiccator.

After surface modification it must be verified that the amine reactive group was stable and able to maintain reactive functionality in order to form biomolecule complexes e.g. receptor ligand pairs . To determine whether the aldehyde group was chemically reactive and available for subsequent biofunctionalization a hydrazide derivative of a common fluorophore i.e. Texas Red TR was used.

After derivatization the nanopowders exhibited obvious and visible differences. The unmodified nano ZnO remained white while the surface modified nano ZnO was a deep purple as expected with successful attachment of TR see inset .

These powders also investigated through fluorescence probing clearly showed the presence of the silane linker on the surface modified nano ZnO. The unmodified nanopowder displayed minimal incorporation of TR indicating that nonspecific binding was negligible . Significantly because the hydrazide form of TR is specifically designed for covalent attachment to amine reactive aldehyde groups these results illustrated that the chemically reactive functionality of the aldehyde while in its immobilized state was retained.

Organosilane Surface Modification. Nanocrystalline ZnO nanorods Nanocerox Inc. with a mean particle size of 10 20 nm wide by 100 300 nm long as determined by transmission electron microscopy TEM were dried overnight under vacuum at 200 C. before use. The nano ZnO was suspended by means of sonication via a Branson Cell Disruptor in 95 ethanol 5 HO at pH 5 adjusted with acetic acid . The organosilane linker 11 triethoxysilylundecanal Gelest Inc. was added without purification to achieve 1 2.5 w w ZnO silane and was allowed to react for 1 hour at 75 C. The powders were collected by filtration and washed extensively with 100 ethanol. The samples were cured at 110 C. for 10 minutes and stored in a desiccator.

Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy FTIR Analysis Of Surface Modified Nano Zno. FTIR spectra of the powdered materials were acquired using a BioRad Fourier transform infrared spectrometer model FTS 60A . Potassium bromide KBr pellets were prepared for FTIR analysis using 200 mg of KBr and 15 mg of sample. A background scan was performed using pure KBr and was automatically subtracted from the data. A total of 32 scans were averaged for each sample.

Optical Characterization. The photoluminescence spectra of the powdered materials were acquired using a Fluorolog 3 fluorescence spectrometer Horiba Jobin Yvon Inc. equipped with a solid sample holder accessory at an excitation wavelength of 325 nm. Three scans were acquired and averaged together for each sample.

X ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS Analysis. Samples for XPS analysis were prepared by suspending 60 mg of the unmodified nano ZnO or the silane modified nano ZnO in 30 mL of the aqueous ethanol solution and sonicating for 3 minutes using a Branson Cell Disruptor. The resulting dispersion was poured over a small copper coupon 1 cm cleaned with dilute hydrochloric acid and distilled water in a Gooch crucible. Copper coupons were used as a means to fix the powders and to minimize surface charging that may occur as a result of uncompensated electron ejection during analysis. The solution was allowed to evaporate drain through the crucible overnight at room temperature. This procedure resulted in a uniform coating of the nano ZnO powder onto the copper coupons. The metal substrates were mounted as is on sample stubs using conducting silver paint on the back side of the substrate holder. The XPS spectra were acquired using 100 W Al K X rays.

The presence of the surface attached cross linking agent was verified through FTIR analysis. XPS analyses demonstrated covalent attachment of the surface modifier. In addition as shown in the intensity of the emitted photoluminescence of the surface modified nano ZnO was significantly higher than the intensity of the emitted photoluminescence of the unmodified nano ZnO.

It is to be understood that the present invention is by no means limited to the particular construction herein disclosed and or shown in the drawings but also comprises any modification or equivalent within the scope of the claims.
