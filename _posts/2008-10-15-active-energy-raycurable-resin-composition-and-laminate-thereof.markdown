The present invention relates to an active energy ray curable resin composition capable of imparting scratch resistance antistatic property and anti staining property to surfaces of for example functional optical films such as anti reflection films and near infrared ray absorbing films on surfaces of optical information media such as read only optical disks optical recording disks and magneto optical recording disks and liquid crystal displays and plasma displays. Furthermore the present invention relates to a laminate having a hard coat layer formed from the active energy ray curable resin composition on a substrate.

Recently optical recording devices which are capable of recording a large capacity of data at a high density and quickly recording and reproducing data have come to attract attention with development of multimedia. Such optical recording devices include devices which reproduce read only disks such as CDs and laser disks in which information is stamped thereon during the disk production and which are capable of only reproducing information devices which record and reproduce write once disks such as a CD R which are capable of recording only once and devices which reproduce and record rewritable disks in which data can be rewritten and erased any number of times by using the magneto optical recording system or the phase change recording system. In such optical recording devices reproducing and recording of data are performed by the use of a light spot obtained by focusing laser light to the diffraction limit with a lens.

In order to record information at a higher density in other words to form smaller bit patterns on an optical information medium it is necessary to make a laser light spot smaller. There are two possible methods for making a size of a light spot smaller namely a method of reducing the laser light wavelength and a method of increasing the numerical aperture NA of the lens. While the wavelength of the laser light currently used for optical disks is mainly from about 780 nm to about 650 nm use of blue laser light or the like having further shorter wavelength have increasingly been investigated.

As to the system which uses blue laser light the minimum bit length has been reduced to about 0.14 m by adjusting the wavelength of the light source to 405 nm the NA to 0.85 and the track pitch to 0.32 m. Thereby blu ray disks having a recording capacity as large as 4 times or more that of a DVD have been commercialized. However when the wavelength of a light source is reduced or the NA of an objective lens is increased the focal length of light becomes shorter. A lens having a higher NA produces blur or aberration more easily. Furthermore it becomes severer to control of the amount of substrate distortion tilt with which the surface of an optical disk inclines from the right angle relative to the optical axis or of the unevenness in thickness of optical disks.

Therefore a data is recorded or reproduced by irradiating laser light converged through a lens having a specific numerical aperture to a recording layer through a 1.2 mm thick polycarbonate substrate surface in conventional CDs or through a 0.6 mm thick substrate in DVDs having two 0.6 mm thick polycarbonate substrates laminated. Conversely in the case of using blue laser light a system is used in which a recording layer is formed on a polycarbonate substrate and further a thin film cover layer of about 0.1 mm in thickness is formed thereon and data are read by irradiating blue laser light to the thin film cover layer surface.

The thin film cover layer is composed of a light transmitting layer which protects the recording layer directly and a hard coat layer for protecting the whole disk surface. The light transmitting layer is formed by a method in which an active energy ray curable resin is applied onto the surface of the recording layer to spread uniformly by a spin coating method or the like or a method in which films are laminated. A hard coat layer is formed by applying an active energy ray curable resin composition and then spreading it uniformly by a spin coating method or the like. While a hard coat layer is formed for the purpose of preventing scratching or adhering of dust or stain such as fingerprint which will cause errors during recording and reproducing these properties are extremely important particularly in use of blue laser light.

On the other hand a hard coat layer which is formed on a surface of a functional optical film to be used for the surface of a liquid crystal or plasma display is required to have excellent property in for example hardness transparency antistatic property for preventing dust due to static electricity from adhering and the property of preventing adhesion of stains such as fingerprint depending on its intended use. Various components are used depending upon the property. These functional optical films are formed in a single layer structure or a multilayer structure on a transparent film of a resin such as polyethylene terephthalate PET polycarbonate PC polymethyl methacrylate PMMA or triacetyl cellulose TAC . Moreover such films are required to be transparent and uniform films free of birefringence because of their properties.

Conventionally fluorine monomers have been added to a compound having an active energy ray curable unsaturated bond for the purpose of preventing stains such as fingerprint from adhering to a hard coat layer. In addition in order to prevent scratching or dust adhesion addition of silica fine particles or fine particles of a metal oxide such as tin oxide doped indium oxide ITO or tin oxide doped antimony oxide ATO addition of fine particles obtained by modifying the surface of such fine particles with a hydrolyzable silane compound and addition of a quaternary ammonium salt have been performed.

When an active energy ray curable resin composition containing these components is applied onto a supporting substrate the smoothness of a coating film is readily impaired and therefore defects in appearance and additionally decrease in accuracy of reading optical information media are caused resulting in serious quality problems.

An object of the present invention is to provide an active energy ray curable resin composition capable of forming a hard coat layer which is excellent in durability of scratch resistance dust resistance anti staining property and the like and which is excellent in surface smoothness at the time of application and to provide a laminate having on a substrate a hard coat layer formed from the active energy ray curable resin composition.

Specific examples of the polyfunctional meth acrylate monomer include 1 3 butylene glycol di meth acrylate 1 4 butanediol di meth acrylate 1 6 hexanediol di meth acrylate 1 9 nonanediol di meth acrylate bisphenol A di meth acrylate bisphenol F di meth acrylate diethylene glycol di meth acrylate hexahydrophthalic acid di meth acrylate hydroxypivalic acid neopentyl glycol di meth acrylate neopentyl glycol di meth acrylate hydroxypivalic acid ester neopentyl glycol di meth acrylate pentaerythritol di meth acrylate phthalic acid di meth acrylate polyethylene glycol di meth acrylate polypropylene glycol di meth acrylate polytetramethylene glycol di meth acrylate bisphenol A diglycidyl ether di meth acrylate triethylene glycol di meth acrylate tetraethylene glycol di meth acrylate tricyclodecanedimethanol di meth acrylate dimethyloldicyclopentane di meth acrylate neopentyl glycol modified trimethylolpropane di meth acrylate tripropylene glycol di meth acrylate triglycerol di meth acrylate dipropylene glycol di meth acrylate glycerol tri meth acrylate pentaerythritol tri meth acrylate phosphoric acid tri meth acrylate trimethylolpropane tri meth acrylate trimethylolpropane benzoate tri meth acrylate tris meth acryloxyethyl isocyanurate di meth acrylated isocyanurate dipentaerythritol hexa meth acrylate dipentaerythritol hydroxypenta meth acrylate ditrimethylolpropane tetra meth acrylate pentaerythritol tetra meth acrylate and derivatives and modification products thereof.

As the compound A having an active energy ray curable unsaturated bond in a molecule a combination of a bi or tri functional monomer such as tripropylene glycol diacrylate or trimethylolpropane triacrylate and a penta or hexa functional monomer such as dipentaerythritol hexaacrylate or dipentaerythritol pentaacrylate is preferred from the viewpoint of keeping the coating film hardness. It is more preferable to further combine polyurethane meth acrylate in order to impart flexibility. The blended amounts of these ingredients preferably are 0 to 30 by weight for the bi or tri functional monomer 2 to 50 by weight for the penta or hexa functional monomer and 0 to 20 by weight for polyurethane meth acrylate.

Next the anti staining property imparting agent B which is a fluorine containing polyether compound in the present invention is a compound having at least one perfluoropolyether unit at least one urethane bond and at least one active energy ray curable unsaturated bond. Perfluoropolyether moieties are apt to gather to the surface of a hard coat layer more in comparison to fluorinated alkyl moieties of fluorinated alkyl meth acrylate so that it imparts an excellent water repellency and oil repellency and or excellent lubricity. On the other hand since the agent B has an active energy ray reactive group a crosslinking reaction between fluorine containing polyether compounds B or a copolymerization reaction with the compound A having an active energy ray curable unsaturated bond is caused by irradiation with an active energy ray when curing a hard coat agent. This makes it possible to fix the agent B in a hard coat layer. As a result a hard coat layer which can exhibit excellent anti staining property and excellent lubricity under various storage conditions and use conditions is formed.

The fluorine containing polyether compound B preferably has the number average molecular weight Mn from 500 or greater to 10 000 or lower in terms of polystyrene determined by GPC. Use of the compound B having this range of the number average molecular weight makes it possible to impart a desired water repellency and oil repellency and or lubricity to the hard coat layer surface ensuring compatibility with other monomer and oligomer components in the active energy ray curable resin composition.

It is preferable that the fluorine containing polyether compound B has 2 or more active energy ray curable unsaturated bonds in the molecule because such a compound is able to further improve the fixation into the hard coat layer and also improve the anti staining property and lubricity. It is preferable that the fluorine containing polyether compound B has an active energy ray curable unsaturated bond on both ends of the molecule respectively because such a compound is able to further improve the fixation into the hard coat layer and it is more preferable that the compound B has two or more active energy ray curable unsaturated bonds on both ends of the molecule respectively. An increased fixation into the hard coat layer will provide a hard coat layer extremely excellent in solvent resistance.

The fluorine containing polyether compound B is based on a fluorine containing polyether compound having a hydroxyl group and perfluoropolyether unit at the ends wherein a meth acryloyl group is introduced via urethane bond into the hydroxyl group. Fluorine containing polyether compounds as a raw material include the following compounds but are not restricted to them. F CFCFCFO CFCFCFOH

l m and n respectively represent polymerization degrees HOCHCH OH CHO CHCFO CFCFO CFO CFCHOCHCH OH CHOH

Specific examples of the fluorine containing polyether compound B include those represented by the following chemical structural formula 1 or 2.

Further specific examples of the fluorine containing polyether compound B include the following compound. CH C CH COO CHCH NHCO OCH CFO CFCFO CFO CFCHO CONH CHCH OCO C CH CH

A compound into which the methacryloyl group is introduced via urethane bond by allowing methacryloyloxyethyl isocyanate Karenz MOI manufactured by SHOWA DENKO K.K. to react with the terminal hydroxyl group of Fomblin Z DOL alcohol modified perfluoropolyether manufactured by Solvay Solexis . 

One kind of the fluorine containing polyether compound B may be used and two or more kinds thereof are used together.

The fluorine containing polyether compound B in the active energy ray curable resin composition of the present invention is preferably within a range of 0.01 by weight or more to 3 by weight or less more preferably 0.05 by weight or more to 1.5 by weight or less in 100 by weight of a nonvolatile components of the composition. Allowing the fluorine containing polyether compound B to contain in a quantity more than 3 by weight improve the anti staining property and lubricity but lower the hardness of the hard coat layer. On the other hand allowing the fluorine containing polyether compound B to contain in a quantity of less than 0.01 by weight cannot improve the anti staining property and lubricity. The nonvolatile component is a component remaining in the hard coat layer after curing including a compound C represented by a general formula 1 inorganic fine particles D photopolymerization initiator and optional components such as various additives in addition to the fluorine containing polyether compound B and the compound A having an active energy ray curable unsaturated bond.

Further a compound having no urethane bond in a molecule namely a compound having at least one perfluoropolyether unit and at least one active energy ray curable unsaturated bond in a molecule can be used instead of the compound B depending on the level of properties required though it is not comparable in properties.

wherein R1 R2 and R3 are respectively an organic group having at least one functional group selected from a vinyl group an epoxy group a meth acryloxy group an amino group and a mercapto group and may be either the same or different and n is an integer of 0 or more. It preferably is a compound having a weight average molecular weight of about 5 000 to about 800 000 in terms of polystyrene standards determined by GPC.

The organic group having at least one functional group selected from a vinyl group an epoxy group a meth acryloxy group an amino group and a mercapto group is a group in which the functional group is bonded via an alkyl group or the like. The organic group also includes a group in which the functional group is bonded directly to silicon. The amino group includes not only primary amino group but also secondary amino group. Examples of such organic groups include besides a group directly bonded to silicon such as a vinyl group a group bonded to silicon via an alkyl group such as a glycidoxypropyl group a meth acryloylpropyl group an aminopropyl group and a mercaptopropyl group and an N 2 aminoethyl 3 aminopropyl group. In particular preferable functional groups include a meth acryloxy group and a vinyl group.

The compound C contained in the active energy ray curable resin composition of the present invention is a compound obtained by hydrolyzing a hydrolyzable silane compound having a functional group and then polymerizing the product by a dehydration condensation reaction. By doing so the compatibility of inorganic fine particles with the compound A having an active energy ray curable unsaturated bond and a anti staining property imparting agent B having an active energy ray curable unsaturated bond is increased drastically. As a result if a hard coat layer is formed by using the active energy ray curable resin composition on a supporting substrate it will become possible to apply the composition uniformly without forming defects in a coating film and a serious quality problem such as defective appearance and drop of reading accuracy will be solved.

The compound C contained in the active energy ray curable resin composition of the present invention preferably is contained in an amount of 1 by weight to 10 by weight and more preferably 5 by weight to 10 by weight in 100 by weight of nonvolatile components in the composition. If the compound C is contained in an amount less than 1 by weight a sufficient effect is not obtained. On the other hand if it is more than 10 by weight it will cause decrease in strength of a coating film.

The inorganic fine particles D contained in the active energy ray curable resin composition of the present invention are fine particles which are composed of at least one kind of fine particles selected from silica fine particles and fine particles of a metal oxide such as antimony oxide tin oxide doped indium oxide ITO or tin oxide doped antimony oxide ATO and which have an average particle diameter of 5 to 100 nm as measured by a dynamic light scattering method. The inorganic fine particles D contained in the active energy ray curable resin composition of the present invention preferably are contained in an amount of 20 by weight to 80 by weight in 100 by weight of nonvolatile components in the composition. One kind of these inorganic fine particles may be used and two or more kinds thereof may be used in combination. As to these inorganic fine particles fine particles having a surface modified with a hydrolyzable silane compound may be used.

The active energy ray curable resin composition of the present invention preferably contains a photopolymerization initiator when curing is performed by use of ultraviolet rays or the like as an active energy ray. Examples of the photopolymerization initiator include benzoin methyl ether benzoin ethyl ether benzoin isopropyl ether benzoin butyl ether diethoxyacetophenone benzyl dimethyl ketal 2 hydroxy 2 methylpropiophenone 1 hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone benzophenone 2 4 6 trimethylbenzoyldiphenyl phosphine oxide 2 chlorothioxanthone and 2 4 diethylthio xanthone. Such photopolymerization initiators may be used either singly or as an appropriate combination of two or more kinds. The photopolymerization initiator may be used in combination with a photosensitizer such as amines e.g. isoamyl N N dimethylaminobenzoate and triethanolamine. The blended amount of the photopolymerization initiator preferably is approximately from 0.1 by weight to 10 by weight with respect to the amount of nonvolatile components in the composition and the amount of the photosensitizer preferably is approximately from 0.1 by weight to 5 by weight with respect to the amount of the nonvolatile components in the composition.

The active energy ray curable resin composition of the present invention may contain a non reactive organic solvent. Examples thereof include aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene esters such as ethyl acetate n propyl acetate iso propyl acetate n butyl acetate and iso butyl acetate alcohols such as methyl alcohol ethyl alcohol n propyl alcohol iso propyl alcohol and n butyl alcohol ketones such as acetone methyl ethyl ketone methyl isobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone ethers such as 2 methoxyethanol 2 ethoxyethanol 2 butoxyethanol ethylene glycol dimethyl ether ethylene glycol diethyl ether diethylene glycol dimethyl ether and propylene glycol methyl ether and ether esters such as 2 methoxyethyl acetate 2 ethoxyethyl acetate 2 butoxyethyl acetate and propylene glycol methyl ether acetate. Such organic solvents may be used either singly or as a mixture of two or more kinds. Such non reactive organic solvents are used in order to impart moderate coating performance fluidity or the like to an active energy ray curable resin composition and the blended amount thereof is properly adjusted within a range such that a desired coating performance or fluidity can be obtained. Moreover additives such as UV absorbers plasticizers crosslinker antioxidants polymerization inhibitors and light stabilizers HALS may be used in the active energy ray curable resin composition of the present invention unless the effect of the present invention is impaired.

Subsequently a description is made on a laminate having a hard coat layer formed from the active energy ray curable resin composition of the present invention by taking an optical information medium henceforth abbreviated as an optical disk and a functional optical film as examples. First an optical disk and a production method thereof are described in detail.

An optical disk of the present invention comprises a film element composed of one or more layers including at least a recording layer or a reflective layer on a supporting substrate wherein at least one of the supporting substrate side surface and the film element side surface is formed of a thin film cover layer comprising a cured film of the active energy ray curable resin composition. In the optical disk to which the present invention is applied at least one of the supporting substrate side surface and the film element side surface and preferably the surface upon which the recording reproducing beam is incident is formed of the thin film cover layer comprising a cured film of the active energy ray curable resin composition.

1. Optical disk in which the film element side surface acts as the surface upon which the recording reproducing beam is incident 

An optical disk in which the film element side surface acts as the surface upon which the recording reproducing beam is incident will be described. is a schematic cross sectional view showing one example of the layer structure of an optical disk to which the present invention is applied. This optical disk is a recording medium and comprises a recording layer that functions as an information recording layer on a supporting substrate of comparatively high rigidity a light transmitting layer on the recording layer and a light transmitting hard coat layer on the light transmitting layer . The hard coat layer acts as the surface upon which the recording reproducing beam is incident and the laser beam for recording or reproducing is incident through the hard coat layer and the light transmitting layer and onto the recording layer . The thickness of the light transmitting layer including the hard coat layer is preferably within a range from 30 to 150 m and more preferably from 50 to 120 m. An example of such an optical disk is the Blu ray Disc. The hardness of the hard coat layer side is at least grade B in a pencil hardness test.

Although not shown in the drawings the present invention also includes optical disks with two or more recording layers in which an additional recording layer is provided on the recording layer through a spacer layer disposed therebetween. In such cases the light transmitting layer and the hard coat layer are formed on the recording layer positioned farthest from the supporting substrate .

The present invention can be applied to all different manner of recording layers. In other words for example the invention can be applied to phase change type recording media pit formation type recording media and magneto optical recording media. Normally a dielectric layer or a reflective layer is provided on at least one side of the recording layer in order to protect the recording layer and provide an optical effect but this layer has been omitted in . Furthermore the present invention is not restricted to recordable type media such as that shown in the drawings and can also be applied to read only type media.

The supporting substrate is not required to be optically transparent when the optical disk is used in such a manner that a laser light is incident through the film element side as described above. However as transparent materials various plastic materials including polycarbonate resins acrylic resins such as polymethyl methacrylate PMMA and polyolefine resins and the like may be used. The supporting substrate is produced by a method such as an injection molding.

On the supporting substrate information recording layer may be obtained by forming the film element using the known materials and the known methods depending on the purpose. As one example a reflective layer is formed by using an Ag type material to have a thickness of about 20 to 200 nm on the reflective layer a second dielectric layer is formed by using a dielectric material to have a thickness of about 20 to 150 nm a phase change recording material layer of SbTe type is formed to have a thickness of about 3 to 50 nm and a first dielectric layer is formed by using a dielectric material to have a thickness of about 20 to 200 nm by a sputtering process respectively. The light transmitting layer is formed on the information recording layer by using active energy ray curable material or light transmitting sheet such as a polycarbonate sheet.

The active energy ray curable material for the light transmitting layer should be optically transparent exhibit low optical absorption or reflection in the laser wavelength range to be used and have low birefringence and is selected from ultraviolet ray curable materials and electron ray curable materials on these conditions.

In the formation of the light transmitting layer the application of the active energy ray curable material onto the surface of the first dielectric layer is preferably conducted using a spin coating method. Following the application the curable material may be cured by irradiation with ultraviolet rays. This ultraviolet ray irradiation may be divided into a plurality of irradiation doses. Furthermore the operation of applying the active energy ray curable material may also be conducted using a plurality of application repetitions with ultraviolet ray irradiation conducted after each individual application repetition. By dividing the ultraviolet ray irradiation operation into a plurality of irradiation doses the resin is able to be cured in a stepwise manner thus enabling a reduction in the stress that accumulates in the disk at any one time due to curing shrinkage leading to a reduction in the overall stress accumulated in the disk. As a result even if the thickness of the light transmitting layer is large as in the case described above a disk with excellent mechanical properties can still be produced.

Alternatively in the present invention a light transmitting layer can also be formed using a light transmitting resin sheet. In such a case the same active energy ray curable material as the material for the light transmitting layer is applied onto the first dielectric layer to form an uncured resin material layer. A light transmitting sheet is then placed on the uncured resin material layer as the light transmitting layer and by subsequently irradiating with active energy rays such as ultraviolet rays and curing the uncured resin material layer the light transmitting sheet is adhered so as to form the light transmitting layer . The active energy ray curable material used for this resin material layer preferably has a viscosity of 3 to 500 mPa s at 25 C. . Application of the resin material layer is preferably conducted using a spin coating method. After curing the thickness of the resin material layer is for example within a range of about 1 to 50 m.

As the light transmitting sheet for example a polycarbonate sheet with any desired thickness within a range from 30 to 150 m is used. More specifically the formation of the light transmitting layer involves placing the polycarbonate sheet of the desired thickness on the uncured resin material layer under vacuum conditions 0.1 atmospheres or lower returning to atmospheric pressure and then conducting irradiation with ultraviolet rays to cure the resin material layer.

A hard coat layer is then formed on the light transmitting layer using the active energy ray curable resin composition. In other words the active energy ray curable resin composition is applied onto the light transmitting layer thus forming an uncured hard coat layer and the applied active energy ray curable resin composition is then irradiated with active energy rays to crosslink and cure thereby forming the hard coat layer .

The coating method for the application is not limited and may be any one of various coating methods such as spin coating dip coating and gravure coating methods. In an alternate method in which a light transmitting sheet is used as the light transmitting layer the hard coat layer is first formed as described above onto a raw light transmitting sheet of continuous length and disks are subsequently stamped out from the raw sheet. In the same manner as described above the disks are placed on the uncured resin material layer and the uncured resin material layer is cured.

When the active energy ray curable resin composition contains the organic solvent the active energy ray curable resin composition is applied to form an uncured hard coat layer which is then dried by heating to remove the organic solvent. Subsequently the active energy rays are irradiated to cure the uncured layer and to thereby form the hard coat layer . By applying the active energy ray curable resin composition using the organic solvent and then removing the organic solvent by heating and drying the fluorine containing polyether compound B tends to concentrate in the proximity of the surface of the uncured hard coat layer. The result is more fluorine containing polyether compound B existing in the proximity of the surface of the cured hard coat layer . This further enhances the lubricity. The heating drying process is preferably carried out at a temperature of for example 40 C. or more and 100 C. or less and over a time period of for example 30 seconds or more and 8 minutes or less preferably 1 minute or more and 5 minutes or less and more preferably 3 minutes or more and 5 minutes or less. The active energy rays may be properly selected from ultraviolet rays electron rays visible rays and other proper active energy rays. Preferably ultraviolet rays or electron rays are used. The thickness of the hard coat after curing is about 0.1 to 50 m preferably 0.5 to 10 m.

In this manner a phase change type optical recording disk such as that shown in may be produced which represents an example of an optical disk in which the film element side surface acts as the surface upon which the recording reproducing beam is incident.

2. Optical disk in which the supporting substrate side surface acts as the surface upon which the recording reproducing beam is incident 

An optical disk in which the supporting substrate side surface acts as the surface upon which the recording reproducing beam is incident will be described. is a schematic cross sectional view showing another example of the layer structure of an optical disk which is applied to the present invention. The optical disk shown in comprises a recording layer on one surface of a supporting substrate and a protective layer on the recording layer whereas a hard coat layer is formed on the other surface of the supporting substrate . The hard coat layer acts as the side upon which the recording reproducing beam is incident and the laser beam for recording or reproducing is incident through the hard coat layer and the supporting substrate and onto the recording layer .

In addition to the write once DVD R disk shown in a variety of other disk formats including read only DVD ROM and rewritable formats such as DVD RAM and DVD RW and the like can be commercially available. Read only DVD formats include DVD Video DVD ROM and the like.

In such an optical disk a light transmitting substrate having a thickness of 0.6 mm is used as the supporting substrate . Conventionally the supporting substrate is formed by injection molding of a polycarbonate resin with various information formed on the surface of the resin as a series of prepits or pregrooves. However other materials may also be used and resins such as polyolefin resins can also be favorably employed.

In the information recording layer of this example using the desired dye depending on the purpose a solution of the organic dye dissolved in a solvent is applied onto the supporting substrate by a spin coating method and is then dried to form an organic dye layer of the desired thickness of about 10 to 300 nm.

Further a reflective layer of Ag type having a thickness of about 10 to 300 nm is provided on the organic dye layer by sputtering or the like.

Usually a supporting substrate is laminated on the reflective layer via a protective and adhesive layer formed by a spin coating method and the like. The supporting substrate can use the same material as that used for the supporting substrate . There are no particular restrictions on the material used for the protective and adhesive layer provided it is capable of bonding the two substrates and together and protects the reflective layer from external forces. However the protective and adhesive layer is formed by using the material such as an ultraviolet ray curable adhesive by a screen printing method or a spin coating method.

On the other hand a light transmitting hard coat layer is formed on the other surface of the supporting substrate . The material for the hard coat layer and the method used for forming the layer are as described above in the section . The hard coat layer acts as the side upon which the recording reproducing beam is incident.

In the manner described above a DVD R disk such as that shown in may be produced which represents an example of an optical disk in which the supporting substrate side surface acts as the surface upon which the recording reproducing beam is incident.

On the other hand the functional optical film includes anti reflection films and anti glare films which are to be used on surfaces of liquid crystal displays plasma displays and the like. Such functional optical films are products obtained by forming a hard coat layer and various functions imparting layer on a substrate surface to impart to the substrate an optical function such as prevention of surface reflection or prevention of background reflection.

The functional optical film in the present invention is a laminate in which a hard coat layer is formed on a surface of a polyester film or a triacetylcellulose film by using the active energy ray curable resin composition of the present invention or a laminate in which a function imparting layer of the active energy ray curable resin composition of the present invention is formed via a hard coat layer.

While the substrate for the functional optical film includes a plastic film and glass a plastic film is preferably used because of its high transparency and in view of cost and ease of handling. Specific examples include films formed of a polyester resin an acrylic resin a triacetylcellulose resin a polyethylene resin a polypropylene resin a polyolefin resin a polycycloolefin resin a polyvinyl chloride resin a polycarbonate resin a phenolic resin and a urethane resin. From the viewpoint of physical properties optical properties chemical resistance environmental load and the like a polyester based film is preferred. More specifically a polyethylene terephthalate film PET film is preferred. As the substrate a so called easy adhesion film in which a resin layer of an acrylic resin a copolymerized polyester resin a polyurethane resin a styrene maleic acid graft polyester resin an acrylic graft polyester resin or the like is provided on a polyester based film may also be used.

The active energy ray curable resin composition of the present invention can be applied by various methods such as bar coating blade coating spin coating reverse coating die coating spray coating roll coating gravure coating lip coating air knife coating and dipping. A drying step may be carried out optionally depending upon whether a solvent exists or not.

A cured film of the active energy ray curable resin composition of the present invention can be formed by crosslink curing an applied hard coat agent by irradiation with an active energy ray. As the active energy ray ultraviolet rays emitted from a light source such as a xenon lamp a low pressure mercury lamp a high pressure mercury lamp an ultrahigh pressure mercury lamp a metal halide lamp a carbon arc lamp a tungsten lamp or the like or electron beams rays rays rays or the like usually taken out from an electron beam accelerator of 20 to 2000 KeV can be used. A hard coat layer formed in such a manner usually is adjusted to be 0.1 to 50 m and preferably 0.5 to 10 m in thickness.

When the active energy ray curable resin composition contains a non reactive organic solvent a hard coat layer can be obtained by the following procedure applying the active energy ray curable resin composition to form an uncured hard coat layer then removing the non reactive organic solvent by heat drying and thereafter conducting irradiation of an active energy ray to cure the uncured layer.

The present invention will be described concretely below by way of examples and comparative examples but the invention is not limited to the examples. All part s and are by weight unless otherwise stated. The property of the active energy ray curable resin compositions shown in the examples and comparative examples was evaluated by the methods shown below and the results thereof are shown in Table 3 and Table 4.

Property evaluation was performed using a substrate for optical disks with a layer structure shown below or a PET film polyester film manufactured by Toyobo Co. Ltd. E5100 . In other words using a disk shaped supporting substrate formed from polycarbonate diameter 120 mm thickness 1.1 mm in which information recording grooves had been formed sputtering was used to form a reflective layer of thickness 100 nm comprising AlPdCu atomic ratio on the groove side surface of the substrate. The depth of the grooves which is represented by light path length at a wavelength 405 nm was set into 6. The recording track pitch in the groove recording scheme was set into 0.32 m.

Subsequently sputtering with an AlOtarget was used to form a second dielectric layer of thickness 20 nm on the surface of the reflective layer. Sputtering using an alloy target comprising a phase changing material was then used to form a recording layer of thickness 12 nm on the surface of the second dielectric layer. The composition atomic ratio of the recording layer was SbTe GeIn . Sputtering with a ZnS 80 mol SiO 20 mol target was then used to form a first dielectric layer of thickness 130 nm on the surface of the recording layer.

Subsequently active energy ray curable resin with the composition shown below was applied onto the surface of the first dielectric layer by a spin coating method and was then irradiated with ultraviolet rays under conditions including an irradiation intensity of 160 W cm and an integrated light quantity of 3 J cm thus forming a light transmitting layer with a cured thickness of 98 m. The resulting optical disk substrate sample was used.

Subsequently a hard coat layer was formed by applying the active energy ray curable resin composition of the present invention to each of the samples. The application was carried out by spin coating for a optical disk substrate and by bar coating for a PET film. Then the solvent was removed using a hot air drying oven followed by ultraviolet ray irradiation at an irradiation intensity of 160 W cm and an integrated light quantity of 3 J cm yielding a coated article having a thickness of about 2 m. The resulting coated articles were evaluated as follows.

A Cellotape registered trademark produced by Nichiban Co. Ltd. was applied thereto. Then it was forcefully peeled off and the surface condition at this time was observed. The evaluation was performed on the basis of the number of cells where a coating film remained without being peeled among 10 10 100 cells.

Information was recorded on a sample using an optical recording medium evaluation unit ODU 1000 manufactured by Pulstec Industrial Co. Ltd. wavelength 405 nm NA 0.85 under the following conditions. Then the bit by bit error rate bER was measured. Judgment was made using 1 10as a threshold. That is an error rate of less than 1 10was judged as good and an error rate of 1 10or more was judged as not good .
