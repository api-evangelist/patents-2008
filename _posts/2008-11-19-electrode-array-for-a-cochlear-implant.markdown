This application is a National Stage Application of International Application No. PCT AU2008 001718 filed Nov. 19 2008 entitled ELECTRODE ARRAY FOR A COCHLEAR IMPLANT which claims priority from Australian Provisional Patent Application No. 2007906334 filed Nov. 19 2007. The contents of these applications are hereby incorporated by reference herein.

This invention relates to implants having electrodes and or contacts for conducting electrical signals and or delivering energy directly to one or more parts of a patient s body.

The following publications are referred to in the present application and their contents are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety Multifunctional Carbon Nanotube Yarns by Downsizing an Ancient Technology Science Vol. 306. no. 5700 pp. 1358 1361 Strong Transparent Multifunctional Carbon Nanotube Sheets Science Vol. 309. no. 5738 pp. 1215 1219 International Patent Application No. PCT AU99 00391 WO 00 71063 to Cochlear Limited and U.S. Pat. No. 7 240 416 to Cochlear Limited.

Medical implants are used in many areas of medicine to enhance the length and or quality of the life of the implant recipient. Such implants include pacemakers controlled drug delivery implants and cochlear implants.

A cochlear implant allows for electrical stimulating signals to be applied directly to the auditory nerve fibers of the patient allowing the brain to perceive a hearing sensation approximating the natural hearing sensation. These stimulating signals are applied by an electrode array implanted into the patient s cochlea.

The electrode array is connected to a stimulator unit which generates the electrical signals for delivery to the electrode array. The stimulator unit in turn is operationally connected to a signal processing unit which also contains a microphone for receiving audio signals from the environment and for processing these signals to generate control signals for the stimulator.

The signal processing unit is in practice located externally to the patient and the stimulator is implanted within the patient usually near the mastoid on the patient s skull and underneath the surrounding tissue. The processor and stimulator may communicate by various wireless means including by a radio frequency link.

During insertion of the electrode damage to the delicate structures of the patient s cochlea often occurs. This damage may cause a loss of any residual hearing.

Several methods have been proposed to reduce insertion trauma including pre curved electrode arrays and the use of insertion tools. However these have not been particularly successful.

According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a device for implanting into the body of a patient the device comprising a stimulator for converting an input signal to an electrical signal at least one wire of an electrode electrically connected to the stimulator for receiving the electrical signal and an electrode contact of the electrode electrically connected to the at least one wire for operationally contacting a part of the body of the patient to deliver the electrical signal wherein at least a portion of one of the at least one wire and or the electrode contact is made from Carbon Nanotubes CNTs .

According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of manufacturing an electrode array for a medical implant the method comprising connecting a wire made at least partially from Carbon Nanotubes CNTs forming the conducting wire to an element made at least partially from Carbon Nanotubes CNTs forming the electrode contact.

According to a third aspect of the present invention there is provided an electrode for a medical implant the electrode comprising a conducting wire and an electrode contact wherein at least a portion of one of the conducting wire and or the electrode contact is made from Carbon Nanotubes CNTs .

The following describes a number of new techniques for manufacturing an electrode array using carbon nanotubes CNTs as well as an implantable medical lead for a cochlear implant comprising an electrode array that is manufactured according to the various techniques as described herein.

An electrode array will be understood to include one or more electrodes. Each electrode will be understood to include an electrode contact and an elongate element such as a conductive filament or wire or strand of conductive filaments or wires collectively referred to herein as wire that is electrically connected to the electrode contact.

CNT spun wires and sheets are described for example in the following documents previously incorporated by reference Multifunctional Carbon Nanotube Yarns by Downsizing an Ancient Technology Science Vol. 306. no. 5700 pp. 1358 1361 and Strong Transparent Multifunctional Carbon Nanotube Sheets Science Vol. 309. no. 5738 pp. 1215 1219 .

CNT wires and or sheets can be obtained from government research bodies such as the CSIRO Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in Australia or from commercial companies including Carbolex Inc. in Ky. Lexington USA Carbon Nanotechnologies Incorporated in Houston Tex. USA Thomas Swan Co. Ltd in the United Kingdom and Sun Nanotech Co Ltd in Nanchang Jiangxi P.R. China.

Upon obtaining a supply of suitable CNT wire see each CNT wire is coated with a 1 to 5 m thick outer electrically insulating barrier layer see . This forms an insulated CNT wire for use in the electrode array. Suitable materials for use in coating each wire include biocompatible polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE polyimide polyurethane and Parylene. Each coated CNT wire is then cut to a required length usually in the order of between 200 mm to 300 mm.

The insulating layer is then removed from the ends of the wire as shown in . This may be achieved by exposing the ends to heat or using laser ablation mechanical abrasion and or any other suitable method so that a conductive portion of the wire becomes exposed. For example one suitable length of exposed conductive portion is 0.1 mm.

Next upon obtaining a supply of CNT sheets a number of discrete pieces are pressed or otherwise cut from the sheet to provide the CNT electrode contacts and as shown in . An example of a cutting process that may be adapted for use in embodiments of the present invention is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 240 416 also owned by the Applicant the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety. The thickness of the CNT sheets can range between 1 to 100 microns. The size of each CNT electrode contact is for example 0.3 mm wide 0.2 mm long but may be varied according to the requirements of the particular application.

Forming the electrode array from CNT wires and or sheets allows the size of each electrode and the thickness of the electrode array to be reduced in comparison with prior art manufacturing methods. Reducing the physical dimensions of each electrode allows the electrode array to be more flexible than those known previously in the art without comprising on the strength required to withstand the stresses placed upon the electrode array during manufacture transport and handling of its lead. Furthermore increasing the flexibility of the electrode array reduces the restoring force required to return a peri modiolar designed cochlear implant lead to its original curved shape after being straightened prior to insertion of the lead into the cochlea such that the thickness of the lead can be further reduced.

In accordance with embodiments of the present invention the risk of insertion trauma and damage to residual hearing can be substantially reduced.

Each of the electrode contacts is then placed in a holding jig so that they may each be connected to a corresponding wire.

Referring to an alternative arrangement provides the joining of an insulated CNT wire to a conventional platinum electrode contact instead of using a CNT electrode contact as previously described. In this case the conventional platinum electrode contact is crimped around the exposed end of the CNT wire to thereby retain the wire in an electrically conductive connection with the electrode contact . Other joining methods that may also be used to electrically secure each wire to its respective electrode contact include gluing with for example conductive adhesive polymers welding or sewing.

Alternatively the elongate element and contact of the electrode is stamped or otherwise cut as a whole from the sheet of CNT material such that no joining is required as shown in .

In order to form the electrode array the electrode contact are placed in a U shaped holding die as shown in . In this case the electrode contacts are welded or otherwise electrically connected to their respective wires in sequential order starting from the most proximal electrode contact such that the wires are only placed over electrode contact after it is welded to its respective wire . This is to avoid creating a short circuit between the wires by inadvertently welding them together. Once all of the wires have been connected to their respective electrode contacts a droplet of adhesive such as adhesive silicone is placed in the trough of each electrode contact in order to secure the wires in place.

As shown in a production stylet for example a PTFE coated wire is suspended or otherwise placed over the electrode array before filling each trough with more silicone. The production stylet is used to hold the electrode contacts in spaced relationship to each other and provide further support to the electrode array and is later removed to form a lumen in the lead. The holding die is then placed in an oven to cure the silicone.

It will be understood that electrode array arrangements need not use a stylet lumen arrangement and the various aspects of the invention are equally applicable to non lumen stylet arrangements.

For example the U shaped holding die can be flooded with silicone such that the electrode contacts are supported in spaced relationship to each other by a partially constructed lead body as shown in .

The electrode array is then removed from the U shaped holding die and placed in a curved moulding die as shown in . The electrode array is positioned within the curved moulding die such that the electrode contacts are located along the medial side inside of the curve of the die . Then the space in the die is packed with silicone material. A matching moulding die cover is placed over the assembly and pressed down as shown in . The curved moulding die is then placed in an oven to cure the silicone after which the electrode array is removed from the die . A similar method as described above for forming conventional electrode arrays is disclosed in International Patent Application No. PCT AU99 00391 WO 00 71063 .

Dimensions of the intra cochlear electrode array typically chosen for a cochlear implant electrode are 18 mm long. The length of the electrode array can range from 2 mm for a short basilar electrode to 40 mm a full length electrode . Other dimensions and shapes are also possible as would be understood by the person skilled in the art.

The electrode array described above forms the distal end of a lead array assembly that is adapted to be connected to an implantable cochlear stimulator ICS as shown in . The lead array assembly includes the electrode array a helix section and a lead end to be connected to the ICS. The ICS is typically housed within a metallic case. The case has an array of feed through terminals corresponding to its multiple channels.

The CNTs can be connected to a standard feedthrough pin platinum pins held in a ceramic layer via crimping. More specifically a notch can be cut into the platinum pin the CNT conducting strand or wire placed in the notch and the pin then crimped around the CNT conducting strand or wire.

Other methods include tying and knotting the CNT conducting strand or wire onto the feedthrough pin and then bending the pin down and over the tied CNT conducting strand or wire to lock the CNT conducting strand or wire to the pin or using conductive adhesive polymers.

Yet another method is to arrange the CNT conducting strand or wires to match the feedthrough pins embed them in an insulating epoxy to provide mechanical support cure the epoxy polish a bottom side of the embedded strand or wires to expose the aligned CNT conducting strand or wires and use conductive epoxy to attach the CNT conducting strand or wires to the feedthrough pins.

Moreover there can be various sizes of electrode contacts. The limitations are based on physically fitting them into the body of the lead. Length of any one contact is dependant on the number of contacts for example 1 256 contacts . The fewer the number of electrode contacts the larger the length can be conversely the higher the number the shorter the length. Width is dependant on the width of the electrode design and whether the electrode contact is flat or wraps around the surface. In one example 22 CNT electrode contacts are used. According to one aspect of the present invention however far more electrodes and corresponding electrode contacts and conducting strand or wires may be used including anywhere from 1 electrode to 256 or more electrodes and more specifically including 22 to 50 electrodes 45 to 70 electrodes 65 to 90 electrodes 85 to 120 electrodes 110 to 150 electrodes 145 to 190 electrodes 180 to 220 electrodes 210 to 240 electrodes 235 to 256 electrodes. It will also be understood that this includes electrode numbers greater than 256 including 257 to 300 300 to 350 350 to 400 400 to 500 500 to 600 600 to 800 800 to 1000 and above.

It will be appreciated that due to the very high surface area of contacts made out of CNT the required size for effective electrical stimulation is reduced from that of contacts made from Platinum.

It will also be understood that various combinations of existing materials and structures may be used. For example one alternative is to join the CNT conducting strand or wires to a traditional electrode contact such as Platinum Pt or Platinum Iridium Pt Ir . hi this case the joining method may be as described above with reference to or including using knots by crimping or by using a conductive polymer adhesive.

In another alternative combination traditional wires e.g. Pt or Pt Ir used as the conducting strand or wires may be joined to CNT electrode contacts. Again the method of joining may be as described above.

In an alternative method of constructing an electrode array lead assembly a fine mesh with square openings in the 5 to 10 micrometer range for example of biocompatible material such as room temperature vulcanized RTV silicone is glued on the outer surface of the electrode contacts. This is to hinder fibrous tissue growth on the outer surface of the electrode contact and or to selectively stimulate only the growth of neuron cells on the outer surface of the electrode contacts.

Alternatively the outer surface of the electrode contacts may be covered in a thin layer of silicone and an ablation process used to create openings in the thin layer of silicone to expose the outer surface of the electrode contact. Suitable ablation processes include UV laser 193 run to 248 nm wavelength ion beam etching and mechanical and or chemical polishing.

Alternatively the outer surface of the electrode contacts may be finished e.g. ground or pressed or patterned e.g. orientated corrugations to achieve selective biological cell response.

In yet a further alternative CNTs are deposited in channels formed in a suitable substrate matrix e.g. silicone PDMS RTV matrix the CNTs are mixed with a curable solution e.g. PVA Poly Vinyl Alcohol a bio compatible water based glue and poured into the channels in the matrix. An electrical field is applied to each channel to align the CNTs in electrical contact with each other after which the solution is cured. CNT conductive structures are thus created in the substrate matrix. The matrix is sealed using an insulating barrier e.g. parylene coating or RTV adhesive . Openings are created in the back of the substrate matrix to expose the CNT electrode contact area for example using an ablation process as described above and a fine mesh micrometer sized openings of biocompatible material such as RTV silicone is deposited on top of the vertically grown CNT electrode contacts to hinder tissue growth on the contact surface and or to selectively stimulate only the growth of neuron cells on the contact surface. A normal electrode array manufacturing process follows as will be understood to the person skilled in the art.

In yet a further method of manufacture the electrode contacts are made out of polyimide foil instead of CNT. After removing the electrode structure from the silicone injection die the polyimide foil contacts are selectively removed for example using an ablation process as described above thus exposing the non insulated terminations of the CNT strand or wires in the array.

The array is placed and carefully positioned in a matching die that allows external access only in the area of the array formerly occupied by the polyimide contacts and ensures surface protection of the rest of the array.

In the openings available on the back of the masking die above CNT structures are vertically grown through a commercially available growth process such as PECVD Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition . The CNT structures thus created are in intimate contact low ohmic resistance with the conductive CNT strand or wires in the electrode array a suitable polymer such as polyvinyl alcohol is deposited in the same openings and cured.

The masking die is removed and surface polishing is used to back trim level the vertically grown CNT electrode contacts formed back to the silicone surface of the electrode array. The thus formed CNT contacts may then be left unchanged or further covered with a conductive polymer such as previously described . The array is placed back in the masking die and a fine mesh 5 to 10 micrometer size openings of biocompatible material such as RTV silicone etc is glued on top of the vertically grown CNT electrode contacts to hinder fibrous tissue growth on contact surface and or selectively stimulate only the growth of neuron cells on the CNT electrode contact surface. A conventional electrode array manufacturing process follows.

In yet a further alternative arrangement both the CNT conducting strand or wire and the CNT electrode contact are stamped from the CNT sheet in a single operation. The CNT conducting strand or wires are coated with a 1 to 6 m for example thick insulating barrier e.g. Parylene C along then length. shows such a structure with electrode contact and insulated CNT wire .

An example of a similar general technique is described in WO 02 089907 in the name of the Applicant of the present application the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. show an exemplary array of electrode contact structures that may be constructed according to this method. A shows the array of CNT conducting strand or wires with respective CNT electrode contacts and . shows the connection between CNT conducting wires and CNT electrode contacts in more detail.

The resulting CNT conducting wire and CNT electrode contact structures are arranged in a moulding die in a pattern suitable for a functional electrode array. A biocompatible adhesive e.g. silicone adhesive is deposited on the backside of each CNT conducting strand or wire CNT electrode contact and along or at points along the CNT wires structure to ensure mechanical stability for subsequent manipulation.

While the various aspects of the present invention have been described with specific reference to a cochlear implant and having dimensions suitable for insertion into the cochlea it will be understood that the principles of the invention may be applied to other types of implantable leads for applications other than cochlear stimulation. For example 

ABI Auditory Brainstem Implant electrode for hearing placed in the brainstem such as Cochlear Corporation s Nucleus 24 R Multichannel Auditory Brainstem Implant Multichannel ABI .

The auditory brainstem implant consists of a small electrode that is applied to the brainstem where it stimulates acoustic nerves by means of electrical signals. The stimulating electrical signals are provided by a signal processor processing input sounds from a microphone located externally to the patient. This allows the patient to hear a certain degree of sound. Examples of such implants are shown in .

FES is a technique that uses electrical currents to activate muscles and or nerves restoring function in people with paralysis related disabilities.

Injuries to the spinal cord interfere with electrical signals between the brain and the muscles which can result in paralysis.

It will be noted for clarity of illustration the FES system shown in is an external system. In an internal system the stimulator and leads and electrodes are all internal and the controller is external. In application with the present invention the leads could be provided by CNT conducting strand or wires.

This system delivers pulses of electrical energy via an electrode in the spinal area and may be used for pain management. An example of a commercially available system is the RESTOREPRIME system by Medtronic Inc USA.

In another embodiment a cochlear implant may be provided that is the same size as or smaller or larger than prior art implants but that has a larger number of electrodes than prior art implants thereby increasing the fineness of resolution of the coded frequencies and thus increasing effectiveness of the implant.

It will be understood that the above has been described with reference to a particular embodiment and that many variations and modifications may be made to the invention without departing from the scopes of the various aspects of the present invention.

It will also be understood that throughout this specification unless the context requires otherwise the words comprise and include and variations such as comprising and including will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers but not the exclusion of any other integer or group of integers.

The reference to any prior art in this specification is not and should not be taken as an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that such prior art forms part of the common general knowledge.
