title: System and methods for providing gaming activities
abstract: Systems and methods for providing gaming activities, these particularly relating to gaming activities implemented in conjunction with a flexible credit arrangement. A consumer is allocated one or more entries in a gaming activity based on a level of transactable flexible credit held by that consumer. For example, the allocation of entries is increased or decreased subject to a corresponding increase or decrease in transactable flexible credit held by the consumer. In some aspects of the present invention, one or more prizes for the gaming activity are funded in whole, or in part, by way of supplementary contributions realized on the basis of consumers' participation in a flexible credit infrastructure.

This application is a national stage of PCT AU2008 001348 filed on Sep. 10 2008 which claims priority to the following applications AU2008901580 filed on Apr. 2 2008 AU2008100204 filed on Mar. 3 2008 AU2008100206 filed on Mar. 3 2008 AU2008100207 filed on Mar. 3 2008 AU2008100208 filed on Mar. 3 2008 AU2008100209 filed on Mar. 3 2008 and AU2007904938 filed on Sep. 10 2007. The entire contents and disclosures of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

The present invention relates to systems and methods for providing gaming activities. Some embodiments provide hardware and software components for the implementation of such systems and methods. The term gaming is intended to be interpreted in the broadest sense as encompassing the fields of gambling gaming wagering betting lotteries and games or competitions of skill and or knowledge and or chance.

The following discussion of the background art is intended to place the invention in an appropriate context and to allow the unique characteristics and advantages of it to be more fully understood. However any discussion of the background art throughout the specification should in no way be considered as an express or implied admission that such background art is widely known or forms part of common general knowledge in the field.

Traditionally gaming activities have relied upon a model whereby a player exchanges an entry fee for one or more entries and does so on the basis that the entry fee is placed at risk in the sense that it will be lost should the one or more entries not be identified as winning entries. This traditional model is founded on a principle whereby entry fees are central to the funding of prizes for a gaming activity.

The present inventor has recognised alternatives to the traditional model. In particular as discussed in PCT AU2007 000774 it is possible to use notions of supplementary contribution to fund prizes without necessarily making direct use of entry fee capital. In a general sense by engaging in predefined activities a player is able to assist in the funding of a prize pool by way of supplementary contribution without necessarily placing any funds at risk. So as to provide a straightforward example a lottery may be conducted whereby players submit respective entry fees and subsequently receive full refunds of their entry fees. Notions of supplementary contribution allow a prize pool for that lottery to be funded in whole or in part by funds derived by the investment of the players entry fees for a predetermined period of time. In some cases the prize pool is funded in whole or in part players supplementary contributions are funded by third parties in consideration for a benefit they receive from the players involvement in the lottery for example in terms of a marketing benefit.

By moving away from the traditional model of gaming there is scope to apply gaming principles in broader contexts.

It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate one or more of the disadvantages of the prior art or at least to provide a useful alternative.

One embodiment provides a computer program product configured to perform a method as described herein.

One embodiment provides a computer system including a processor configured to perform method as described herein.

One embodiment provides a computer computer readable carrier medium carrying a set of instructions that when executed by one or more processors cause the one or more processors to carry out a method as described herein.

Reference throughout this specification to one embodiment some embodiments or an embodiment means that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus appearances of the phrases in one embodiment some embodiments or in an embodiment in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment but may. Furthermore the particular features structures or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner as would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art from this disclosure in one or more embodiments.

Similarly it should be appreciated that in the present description of exemplary embodiments of the invention various features of the invention are sometimes grouped together in a single embodiment figure or description thereof for the purpose of streamlining the disclosure and aiding in the understanding of one or more of the various inventive aspects. This method of disclosure however is not to be interpreted as reflecting an intention that the claimed invention requires more features than are expressly recited in each claim. Rather as the following claims reflect inventive aspects lie in less than all features of a single foregoing disclosed embodiment. Thus the claims following the Detailed Description are hereby expressly incorporated into this Detailed Description with each claim standing on its own as a separate embodiment of this invention.

Furthermore while some embodiments described herein include some but not other features included in other embodiments combinations of features of different embodiments are meant to be within the scope of the invention and form different embodiments as would be understood by those in the art. For example in the following claims any of the claimed embodiments can be used in any combination.

Furthermore some of the embodiments are described herein as a method or combination of elements of a method that can be implemented by a processor of a computer system or by other means of carrying out the function. Thus a processor with the necessary instructions for carrying out such a method or element of a method forms a means for carrying out the method or element of a method. Furthermore an element described herein of an apparatus embodiment is an example of a means for carrying out the function performed by the element for the purpose of carrying out the invention.

In the description provided herein numerous specific details are set forth. However it is understood that embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known methods structures and techniques have not been shown in detail in order not to obscure an understanding of this description.

As used herein unless otherwise specified the use of the ordinal adjectives first second third etc. to describe a common object merely indicate that different instances of like objects are being referred to and are not intended to imply that the objects so described must be in a given sequence either temporally spatially in ranking or in any other manner.

In the claims below and the description herein any one of the terms comprising comprised of or which comprises is an open term that means including at least the elements features that follow but not excluding others. Thus the term comprising when used in the claims should not be interpreted as being limitative to the means or elements or steps listed thereafter. For example the scope of the expression a device comprising A and B should not be limited to devices consisting only of elements A and B. Any one of the terms including which includes or that includes as used herein is also an open term that also means including at least the elements features that follow the term but not excluding others. Thus including is synonymous with and means the same as comprising .

Similarly the term coupled when used herein should not be interpreted as being limitative to direct connections only. The terms coupled and connected along with their derivatives may be used. The scope of the expression a device A coupled to a device B should not be limited to devices or systems wherein an output of device A is directly connected to an input of device B. It means that there exists a path between an output of A and an input of B which may be a path including other devices or means. Coupled may mean that two or more elements are either in direct physical or electrical contact or that two or more elements are not in direct contact with each other but yet still co operate or interact with each other.

In the context of the present disclosure it is assumed that a gaming activity is an activity where multiple players provide respective entry fees. In exchange for the entry fees the players are respectively allocated one or more entries. The term player as used herein refers to a provider of an entry fee. The term should be construed broadly to include both human players non human players constructs or syndicates defined by a group of two or more human and or non human players such as a collaboration between human players and other legal entities such as corporations or trusts . In some cases the player is identified in a computing system by a unique identifier which might include a purpose defined identifier identifier based on personal information email address cellular telephone number or the like.

In the context of the present disclosure there is discussion of players being allocated entries and disclosure of players being provided entries. The terms allocated and provided are regarded as synonymous in this regard. Furthermore neither of these terms should imply a requirement that a player actually physically receives any entries although equally they may do so only that the entries are notionally allocated to that player.

Although players are considered to provide respective entry fees it will be appreciated that in some instances a single player provides multiple entry fees on multiple occasions.

In the present context the term entry fee describes a sum of consideration that constitutes a wholly or partially refundable payment. No specific implications or connotations should be drawn from the use of the word fee which is descriptive only. In some embodiments the entry fee is provided in whole or in part as monetary currency. In other embodiments the entry fee is notionally derived such as where a consumer purchases predefined goods and or services unrelated to an entry and an entry fee is notionally determined as a function of the purchase value or where the player participates in marketing activities by viewing advertisements or responding to a survey for instance and an entry fee is notionally defined on the basis of a benefit the gaming operator or a third party receives by virtue of the player s participation in those marketing activities. That is by purchasing a certain product a consumer is deemed to have provided an entry fee and is correspondingly allocated one or more entries. In the presently considered embodiments the entry fee is wholly provided for the purpose of participation in a gaming activity.

In sonic embodiments the entry fee defines only a portion of the sum of consideration provided by a player in exchange for one or more entries. For example in some embodiments a player provides an entry amount including an entry fee and an additional component this additional component being in some cases attributable to an operator service charge. In some embodiments although an entry fee is fully refundable it is only the entry fee component of an entry amount that is fully refundable with the additional component being non refundable. It should also be appreciated that the entry fee need not be monetary in nature at all but could constitute any tradable commodity having a real virtual deemed or perceived value.

References to refunds refundable entry fees and the like should be understood unless the context dictates otherwise to encompass full and partial refunds as well as gross and net refunds. In some instances for example a nominal refund may be subject to taxes duties levies or other charges such that the net refund actually received by a player is less than the nominal or gross refund irrespective of whether that refund is notionally full or partial. Such variations should not be considered to depart from the substance or scope of the present invention.

As used herein the terms gaming and gaming activity should be construed broadly so as to encompass any form of gambling gaming or wagering including but not limited to 

It will be appreciated that in all of these examples multiple players provide respective entry fees and in exchange for the entry fees the players are respectively provided with one or more entries.

The term pari mutuel refers generally to a gaming arrangement whereby prizes are funded in whole or in part by entry fees. This term is intended to be synonymous with paramutual para mutual parimutuel mutual betting and other variants.

A method for providing a gaming activity includes substantially any method by which a gaming activity is provided. This includes but is not limited to methods performable by administrators of gaming activities methods performable by vendors of entries in gaming activities methods performable by players computer implemented methods performable in relation to the administration of gaming activities and or sale of entries in such gaming activities and so on. Likewise a system for providing a gaming activity includes substantially any hardware component or group of hardware components associated with the performance of a method for providing a gaming activity. For example such systems include information systems maintained or implemented by or on behalf of administrators of gaming activities vendors of entries in gaming activities or the players themselves.

As used herein the term gaming operator describes a party or group of parties responsible for the carriage and administration of a gaming activity. That is a gaming operator is responsible for tasks including but not limited to defining entry parameters and other predefined terms and conditions for the gaming activity offering for sale entries in exchange for entry fees receiving entry fees from players allocating entries to players in exchange for those entry fees identifying one or more winning entries and arranging for the distribution of prizes among the players. In practice these tasks are often performed by a number of parties. For example a first category of party such as vendors or agents may be responsible for offering for sale entries in exchange for entry fees and receiving entry fees from players whilst a second party may be responsible for identifying one or more winning entries. However this is ignored for the present purposes and the term gaming operator should be read sufficiently broadly so as to cover whatever group of related and or unrelated parties are responsible for the carriage and administration of a particular gaming activity.

Thus in some cases a gaming activity may be provided by a plurality of parties which might or might not be related or affiliated. Additionally in some cases a gaming activity may include a plurality of sub activities such as individual lotteries that might in themselves be provided by differing parties. However it should be appreciated that a plurality of such sub activities regardless of the nature of the relationship between providing parties should be considered as a single gaming activity in the context of the present disclosure. In some cases a plurality of sub activities may be conducted by differing parties in different locations and or with differing branding. However some or all of the entry fees from these sub activities might be notionally or physically combined into a common pool for example to facilitate investment risk management or infrastructure sharing activities. In such cases the sub activities should certainty be collectively regarded as a single gaming activity in the context of the present disclosure.

In some cases a first gaining activity is provided by a first party and this first gaming activity leveraged by a second party to provide a second gaming activity. For example various embodiments discussed herein include an arrangement whereby a flexible credit service provider is responsible for providing a gaming activity and to do so leverages an existing gaming activity that is provided by a gaming service provider or via a scheme such as a Bonus Bonds or Prize Bonds scheme. In such circumstances it is generally considered that both parties provide gaming activities.

The term complementary is primarily used herein with reference to relative percentages of two mutually exclusive components or proportions primarily the proportion of an entry fee that is placed at risk and the complementary proportion that is refundable or vice versa . In this context if a given proportion is X then the complementary proportion would be 100 X . It should also be noted that as used herein unless the context clearly dictates otherwise any reference to a proportion is intended to encompass the situations where that proportion is 0 or 100 as well as any intermediate percentage.

Described herein are various systems and methods for providing gaming activities these particularly relating to gaming activities implemented in conjunction with a flexible credit arrangement. In overview a consumer is allocated one or more entries in a gaming activity based on a level of transactable flexible credit held by that consumer. For example the allocation of entries is increased or decreased subject to a corresponding increase or decrease in transactable flexible credit held by the consumer. In some embodiments one or more prizes for the gaming activity are funded in whole or in part by way of supplementary contributions realized on the basis of consumers participation in a flexible credit infrastructure.

The terms flexible credit and transactable flexible credit are used interchangeably herein. That is although in some instances the term transactable is omitted it is to be assumed that the flexible credit in question is transactable nevertheless. Further elaboration in relation to the meaning of these terms is provided further below.

Various embodiments described herein leverage notions of risk free gaming or reduced risk gaming whereby a player s entry fee is wholly or partially refundable irrespective of the outcome of a gaming activity. However the present invention is by no means limited as such. That is some embodiments are implemented in conjunction with traditional at risk gaming activities. Additional discussion of risk free gaming reduced risk gaming and at risk gaming is provided further below.

Broadly speaking the term flexible credit is used to describe a form of credit that is received subject to an interaction between a supplier and a consumer such as a form of transaction retail or otherwise and maintained for use in subsequent transactions. In many cases the flexible credit exists in conjunction with a reservoir of interest bearing funds that are directly or indirectly transactable by consumers to whom the funds are attributable. The funds are interest bearing in the sense that an investment return can be derived. This investment return is not necessarily attributable to the owner of the funds i.e. the consumer account holder . Rather the investment return is at least in the first instance controlled by the party responsible for holding the funds i.e. the administrator of a flexible credit arrangement which in some cases is the supplier or an affiliate of the supplier .

The terms supplier and consumer should be afforded broad interpretations. A supplier is any party that provides goods and or services to another. Likewise a consumer is any party that receives goods and or services from another party.

In each of these situations a flexible credit service provider holds funds on behalf of a plurality of consumers either directly or notionally funds being required to cover the cost of benefits purchased by those consumers using flexible credit. The funds increase over time as additional flexible credit is awarded and decrease as flexible credit is consumed. In some embodiments of the present invention at least a portion of these funds are used provide the consumers with access to a risk free gaming activity.

In some embodiments the funds are used to obtain no risk recurring entries in a suitable gaming activity such as a no risk lottery or other risk free gaming activity provided in accordance with principles set out in PCT AU2007 000774 such that those entries are able to be allocated to consumers. Further discussion of no risk recurring entries and risk free gaming activities also referred to as no risk gaming activities is provided further below. The allocation of entries between consumers is not necessarily one to one in some embodiments a single entry is proportionally allocated between a plurality of consumers who likewise proportionally share any resulting prize. For example this may occur by way of a syndication mechanism.

In some embodiments the funds are used to obtain bonds or the like in a scheme such as NZ Bonus Bonds or Irish Prize Bonds and these Bonus Bonds allocated to consumers. For the present purposes such schemes are regarded as risk free gaming activities although they by some interpretations investment activities rather than gaming activities . For the purposes of the present specification it is the element of chance in allocation of rewards that categorises such an investment scheme as a gaming activity. Again allocation is not necessarily one to one in some embodiments a single entry might be proportionally allocated between a plurality of consumers who would likewise proportionally share any resulting prize. In fact in this case the consumers participate in a gaming activity that is in effect provided by the existence of such bonds although the consumer themselves do not engage in ownership of Bonus Bonds and therefore need not be concerned with matters of investment . Rather the service provider holds the bonds maintains a record of the allocation of these among the consumers and distributes any prizes accordingly.

It will be appreciated that further embodiments implement alternate approaches for providing entries in a pre existing risk free gaming activity.

Data is indicative of a transaction between consumer and supplier . This data is provided to a flexible credit administration system . The nature of data varies between embodiments. However at a general level it is indicative of the consumer for example by way of a consumer reward account identifier or by way of a unique transaction identifier which identifies the consumer by virtue of the transaction and indicative of one or more characteristics of the transaction such as the total transaction value . This data is processed at a central server to determine a level e.g. quantum value of flexible credit that should be allocated to the consumer. This level of flexible credit is allocated to the consumer in a consumer account database .

In some embodiments consumers are individually identifiable in the consumer account database based on respective consumer identifiers. However in other embodiments a consumer is identifiable based on a consumer identifier that does not directly identify a particular consumer. For example a consumer identifier may be derived from an anonymously purchased stored value card or the like. In such cases a consumer is identifiable based on carriage of the stored value card rather than a personalising characteristic such as a personalised loyalty card credit card personal account login information or the like .

The flexible credit administration system interacts with a gaming administration system . This gaming system provides an arrangement whereby an entry fee is able to be exchanged for one or more entries in a gaming activity.

In overview system obtains entries in a gaming activity from system for allocation to consumers such as consumer . In some embodiments entries are allocated to consumers in the sense that database is updated to associate a given consumer identifier with one or more entry identifiers for entries that have been allocated in whole or in part to the consumer.

System provides to system data indicative of entry fees and entry purchase instructions. Data is in some cases provided in respect of each appropriate item of data . For example each item of data is processed to determine an entry fee amount and this entry fee amount is applied as an entry fee in the context of system . In other cases data is provided periodically. For example system maintains a pool of entries for allocation to consumer accounts and periodically increases the size of that pool to ensure that sufficient entries are available for allocation to consumers over time.

System includes a gaming server which is responsible for the allocation of entries identification of winning entries and distribution of prizes. This server operates in conjunction with a gaming database .

System provides to system data indicative of entry outcome information refunds and prizes. In the case that an entry allocated to a given consumer is a winning entry the resulting prize is marked for distribution to that consumer. In some cases less than 100 of the prize is distributed to the consumer.

Discussion in relation to the present embodiments centres on the use of no risk recurring entries . These are in essence entries that have a periodic opportunity to win a prize but are fully refundable at substantially any time. Additional discussion of the concepts underlying no risk recurring entries is provided in PCT patent application PCT AU2007 000774 and some general guidance provided in the following section.

In some embodiments entries are allocated by system on the basis of a risk profile. Detailed discussion of risk profiles is provided in PCT 2007 000774 and some general context provided below.

In a gaming activity wherein a plurality of players provide respective entry fees one or more risk profiles are able to be defined. Each risk profile defines a proportion of an entry fee that is refundable on the basis of predetermined refund criteria and a complementary proportion of the entry fee that is placed at risk. For each player entry data is indicative of the entry fee provided by that player and a risk profile selected by that player. Each player is allocated on the basis of the entry fee provided by that player and the risk profile selected by that player one or more entries in relation to the gaming activity.

The term complementary is primarily used herein with reference to relative percentages of two mutually exclusive components or proportions primarily the proportion of an entry fee that is placed at risk and the complementary proportion that is refundable or vice versa . In this context if a given proportion is X then the complementary proportion would be 100 X . It should also be noted that as used herein unless the context clearly dictates otherwise any reference to a proportion is intended to encompass the situations where that proportion is 0 or 100 as well as any intermediate percentage.

The nature and number of risk profiles defined varies between embodiments. There are three main categories of risk profile 

It will be appreciated that which of these categories are made available varies between embodiments. In particular some embodiments make use of a no risk profile and full risk profile exclusively some embodiments make use of a no risk profile full risk profile and one or more hybrid risk profiles some embodiments make use of a no risk profile and one or more hybrid risk profiles some embodiments make use of full risk profile and one or more hybrid risk profiles and some embodiments may only make use of one or more hybrid risk profiles.

The manner in which risk profiles are defined also varies between embodiments. Generally speaking there are two main approaches which are by no means mutually exclusive. The first approach is for a gaming operator to stipulate one or more predefined risk profiles and make these available to players. In one such embodiment only the no risk and full risk profiles are made available while in another such embodiment hybrid risk profiles are additionally or alternatively made available at for example 20 increments 20 at risk with 80 refundable 40 at risk with 60 refundable and so on . Of course this simple example should not be regarded as limiting and other increments including consistent and inconsistent increments are used in other instances. The second approach is for a gaming operator to allow players to stipulate risk profiles. For example a given player is invited to stipulate precisely how much of his or her entry fee is to be placed at risk and or how much of his or her entry fee is to be refundable. Although and or is used in this situation it will be appreciated that in most cases a player by stipulating precisely how much of his or her entry fee is to be placed at risk inherently by exclusion stipulates how much is to be refundable and vice versa.

Although the majority of embodiments discussed in PCT 2007 000774 are concerned with a situation where a plurality that is two or more risk profiles are defined in some embodiments there is only a single risk profile. In particular in some embodiments only a single hybrid risk profile is defined. That is all of the players place their respective entry fees on the basis of the same hybrid risk profile. Furthermore embodiments of the present invention are applicable to gaming activities where the only risk profile is a no risk risk profile.

The term refund as used herein is intended to encompass a full or partial refund of the value component of an entry fee whether in the form in which it was contributed or in some other form. Refunds may therefore be in cash or in kind. In particular in some embodiments of the invention a refund may take the form of a limited rollover entry for a specified number of subsequent gaming activities of the same or different type an unlimited rollover entry for an indeterminate number of subsequent gaming activities of the same or different type or the maintenance of a limited rollover entry or an unlimited rollover entry from a previous gaming activity. The term is also intended to encompass the option of a refund in whatever form whether or not that option is exercised at any particular point in time or at all. In some embodiments a player is able to exercise the option of a refund at substantially any point in time. Further the term refund is intended to encompass the concept of a promised prize whether as an alternative to or in addition to a refund based on the value component of the entry itself. It is therefore possible that a refund in the context of particular gaming activities may exceed the full value component of the corresponding entry.

As noted a no risk entry is an entry that is allocated on the basis of a risk profile for which 100 of the entry fee is refundable. A no risk recurring entry is in general terms a no risk entry which has the opportunity of win a prize in periodic draws of a gaming activity as discussed below.

The outcome of the gaming activity is determined at step . Step is bounded by a dashed line to indicate that it is at least in some cases an independent event and not necessarily part of method . For example in some embodiments the outcome of a gaming activity is determined by the completion of a sporting event or the like.

Step includes identifying one or more winning entries. In the context of some gaming activities there is only a single winning entry whereas in other gaming activities there are multiple winning entries. In overview the gaming operator has in place predefined criteria for determining based on the outcome of the gaming activity which entries are winning entries entries in respect of which a win event applies and which entries are non winning entries entries in respect of which a no win event applies . In one simple example the gaming activity involves wagering on the outcome of a sporting event between two teams Team A and Team B. Assume a given entry is placed on the basis of a wager that Team A will be victorious. If the outcome of the sporting event reveals that Team A was indeed victorious that entry would be identified as a winning entry. Otherwise it would be identified as a non winning entry. It will be appreciated that identifying winning entries is a more detailed procedure in for example complex lottery style games.

Step includes distributing a prize pool of prizes to players to whom the winning entries were allocated. That is a prize pool is used to fund one or more prizes and these prizes are awarded to the winning players or player in the event that there is only one prize or in the event that one player wins all prizes . This is carried out in accordance with a predefined prize distribution protocol. There is no requirement that at the completion of step the relevant players have physically received prizes. Rather in some embodiments step includes simply making it possible for winning players to obtain prizes by redeeming their entries in a designated manner. In some practical cases winning entries are never redeemed and the corresponding prizes never physically awarded.

The prize pool and prizes distributed from that prize pool need not be monetary in nature. For example in some embodiments the prize pool includes goods and or services for distribution as prizes. Examples include but are not limited to automobiles consumer electronic devices fashion products retail goods livestock real property professional services education services hospitality services discount coupons entries in other gaming activities and so on.

Step includes refunding the entry fees and more precisely defining the refund of entry fee as no risk entry fee in relation to a subsequent draw. This is in some embodiments notional only and a given entry is by default treated as a recurring entry without any physical refund process. For example in one embodiment an entry is indicative of a set of one or more lottery numbers and the same set of one or more lottery numbers is used by that entry in multiple draws.

The party to whom an entry is allocated is permitted to cancel the recurring nature of that entry and in doing so receive a refund of the associated entry fee. In this manner it is possible for system to periodically obtain and surrender entries via system depending on various considerations including cash flow and the like.

It should be appreciated that the term no risk is not intended to mean that there is absolutely no risk whatsoever. For example although there is no risk in a descriptive sense as applied to a gaming activity some risk will always exist in an absolute sense for example subject to natural economic disasters or the like.

It will be appreciated that in terms of flexible credit embodiments consumers take on the role of players . The term player describes a party who has a chance to win a prize i.e. a party to whom one or more entries are wholly or partially allocated.

As noted in some embodiments system allocates recurring entries on the basis of a 100 refundable i.e. no risk risk profile i.e. entry fees are refundable regardless of whether an entry is a winning entry . In some cases system provides for other risk profiles in addition. However as will be appreciated from the discussion herein it is particularly advantageous to implement the present embodiments in the context of a no risk profile gaming activity.

It will be appreciated that there may be forms of no risk recurring entries present in activities other then those specifically described herein or present by virtue of artefacts in further scenarios that provide subject matter similar in function to no risk recurring entries. For example investment programs such as Ireland s Prize Bonds the UK s Premium Bonds and New Zealand s Bonus Bonds effectively provide subject matter similar in function to no risk recurring entries. In particular bonds are purchased these providing a periodic opportunity to win a prize. The bonds can be redeemed at any time for a full refund.

In broad terms consumers are allocated a number of no risk recurring entries corresponding to the level of flexible credit in their respective accounts or more particularly allocation de allocation occurs responsive to variations in the level of flexible credit. The number of entries increases as does the level of credit. Likewise where credit is consumer e.g. redeemed for benefits or applied against a transaction the number of entries is decreased.

The general approach of applying no risk recurring entries to flexible credit embodiments allows for consumers to participate in gaming at least in terms of having an opportunity to win a prize without risk and simply for maintaining a level of transactable flexible credit.

Step includes receiving subject to a transaction between a consumer and a supplier data indicative of an account identifier and associated data indicative of a flexible credit adjustment. The nature of data indicative of the account identifier varies between embodiments and the notion should be read broadly. In essence all that is required is some form data that allows the identification of a unique account in a consumer account database. The data indicative of a flexible credit adjustment may relate to an increase in credit or a decrease in credit.

Step includes querying a consumer account database to identify a consumer account corresponding to the account identifier. This database includes data for a plurality of accounts. The database is configured so that each account includes data indicative of a level of transactable flexible credit. Each account also includes data indicative of an allocated none or more entries in a risk free gaming activity.

Step includes updating the level of flexible credit in the identified consumer account based on the flexible credit adjustment. For example where the adjustment is an increase in for instance reward points or monetary value the level of flexible credit is increased.

Step includes updating the data indicative of the allocated none or more entries such that the allocation of entries corresponds to the updated level of flexible credit. In broad terms where the level of flexible credit increases the consumer account receives an increased allocation of entries. Likewise where the level of flexible credit decreases the consumer account is updated to reflect a decreased allocation of entries i.e. there is a de allocation of entries . This may be based upon notions of contribution whereby there is relative proportionality between a player s contribution for example in terms of the funding of entries or the funding of a prize pool and the allocation of entries to that player. That is where a first player makes a first level of contribution and a second player makes a second level of contribution that is greater than the first level of contribution the second player receives a greater allocation of entries than the first player and therefore has a greater relative probability of wining a prize .

To facilitate convenient allocation de allocation de allocation should be interpreted as the converse of allocation of entries some embodiments implement a model whereby the service provider maintains a pool of entries for allocation re allocation to consumers re allocation describes a process whereby an entry is allocated for a second third or ntime by allocation de allocation and then re allocation and so on . For example a number of no risk recurring entries are purchased from a gaming provider and these entries are maintained in a pool for allocation re allocation to consumers. This is contrasted with an approach whereby entries are obtained from or returned to a gaming provider in response to each flexible credit adjustment. Rather the size of the pool is periodically adjusted over time such that sufficient entries are available for allocation and optionally such that sufficient funds are retained on hand to cover the costs associated a steady pattern or flexible credit redemptions. It will be appreciated that such a balance is easier to strike where a lesser proportion of funds held on behalf of consumers is directed into gaming.

The term allocation should be read broadly to include partial allocation . That is a single entry might be 10 allocated to one consumer 20 to another and so on. In this manner small amounts of money from a plurality of consumers can be syndicated together such that a level of participation is possible even for a relatively insignificant value of flexible credit. Where a single entry is allocated to a plurality of consumers based on a given ratio any resulting prize is shared among those consumers on the basis of a like ratio.

Based on the present pool model there may be situations where a prize is awarded in respect of an entry that is wholly or partially unallocated. In some embodiments the prize or part thereof corresponding to the unallocated portion of the entry is retained by the service provider. In other embodiments a protocol is applied such that the prize or part thereof corresponding to the unallocated portion of the entry is distributed to one or more of the consumers optionally subject to a second chance draw or the like.

A significant advantage of the pool model is the ability to apply retrospective allocation de allocation of entries. This is particularly significant in the context of stored value card arrangements where flexible credit is able to be obtained and or consumed at terminals that are not in constant communication with a central account database. In such cases the value of flexible credit for a given consumer is maintained locally on the stored value card itself for example by way of smartcard technology . However there may be a time delay in adjustment data being propagated back to the central account database this will depend on the manner by which non connected terminals are managed in the particular circumstances . Retrospective allocation de allocation is used to manage resulting complications. For example where flexible credit adjustment data is received subject to a delay data indicative of the transaction time for that adjustment is used to retrospectively allocate or de allocate entries as of that time.

In this example the consumer account is identified by account identifier 123ABC . Three entries are allocated to this account two being partially allocated and one being fully allocated. Entry 111 1112 was 10 allocated from Time A to Time B and 9 allocated from Time B onwards. This indicates that at Time B there was a consumption of flexible credit resulting in the de allocation of a share of that entry.

It will be appreciated that this exemplary record is provided for the sake of explanation only and should not be regarded as limiting in any way. For example in some embodiments each account includes further information such as personal contact information transaction history information and so on.

In some embodiments rather than partially allocating entries an alternate approach is used whereby each obtained entry in a pool such as a single no risk recurring entry or a single Bonus Bond is notionally split into a larger number of lesser value sub entries for allocation to consumers. These sub entries are provided respective unique entry identifiers by the flexible credit service provider.

In other embodiments alternate approaches are implemented for retrospective allocation de allocation of entries is conducted on a retrospective basis. The underlying rationale is to ensure that the consumers opportunity to win prizes based on one or more entries extends only over the time during which funds are held on behalf of that consumer result in a sufficient gaming allocation value to cover the cost of entry fees in respect of those one or more entries. In some cases there is a lag between flexible credit being used and the value of held funds actually decreasing and an event being initiated such that the number of allocated entries is decreased. This is particularly relevant in the case of some stored value card arrangements whereby credit may be used at disconnected terminals and knowledge of this use is conveyed to a central server at a later point in time. To this end some embodiments implement a retrospective entry allocation reconciliation method. Such a method is typically initiated by a redemption request whereby the consumer presents his her stored value card to a connected terminal and a check is initiated to determine whether the consumer has won a prize. Firstly the consumer s transaction history is processed to determine the held value over time. From this it is possible to retrospectively determine by way of unique entry identifiers those entries that should have been allocated to the consumer over time. It is then considered whether prizes were awarded in respect of those entries are the relevant times. It will be appreciated that other retrospective entry allocation reconciliation methods are used in further embodiments.

An entry administration system coordinates the allocation of no risk recurring entries to consumers. In overview system maintains the value of available funds at a threshold level suitable for funding day to day realisations of flexible credit. Where funds causes available funds to exceed this threshold level an amount is allocated to a gaming transfer amount . Likewise where funds reduce the value of available funds to below the threshold level system reduces the value of the gaming transfer amount to increase the value of available funds . In this manner amount essentially provides a bridge between flexible credit and gaming.

A portion of amount is used to fund entry fees and is attributable to a system gaming amount . A portion of the gaming amount is attributable to an investment amount and a portion is returned to the gaming amount. It will be appreciated that this provides a circulation for the generation of supplementary income in the form of a net investment return amount as discussed in more detail further below. In broad terms investment activities are used to derive a return which is at least in part used in the funding of prizes.

A portion of the gaming amount is distributed as prizes . Another portion of the gaming amount relates to refunds and is returned to the gaming transfer amount . In overview refunds are obtained where there is a need to increase the value of available funds i.e. one or more entries are cancelled to receive refunds of the associated entry fees .

Step describes a second event whereby the consumer increases his her flexible credit i.e. by purchasing additional flexible credit or decreases his her flexible credit i.e. by exchanging some or all of the flexible credit for goods services . Based on this second event the held value either increases or decreases at step . It will be appreciated that such a variation in the held value affects the gaming allocation amount for the relevant consumer noting that the gaming allocation amount is a predetermined proportion of the held value . To account for this step includes allocating to the consumer one or more additional entries in the case of an increase or de allocating from the consumer one or more entries in the case of a decrease . De allocated entries are depending on the circumstances cancelled to obtain refunds for example where there exists a need to increase value allocated to another one or more consumers or returned to the pool for subsequent allocation to one or more consumers.

As noted a specific example of flexible credit includes reward points in the context of a reward program. In some embodiments a gaming activity is implemented in conjunction with a reward program such as a frequent flyer program. In broad terms such reward programs allow consumers to accrue reward points and redeem these for a benefit. The present approach affords to consumers the opportunity to win a prize based on the quantum of reward points they have respectively accrued without affecting the ability to later redeem those points for a benefit. For example in some embodiments a monetary value corresponding to the quantum of reward points is used to fund one or more entries in a gaming activity whereby the entries are allocated on the basis of a no risk profile. In this manner the entry fees are fully refundable.

The term reward program describes an arrangement whereby consumers accrue reward points with are redeemable against a benefit. These notions should be construed in a broad manner. Common examples include frequent flyer programs and other loyalty schemes. In overview each consumer has a reward account identifiable on the basis of a unique account identifier. This account maintains a value of reward points which need not be greater than zero . A reward program administrator is responsible for increasing the value of reward points in a given consumer reward account in the case that the relevant consumer participates in predefined activities. These activities might include 

It will be appreciated that the above context is provided for the sake of explanation only and that the present invention should not be limited in any way to particular reward program characteristics.

Data indicative of a transaction between consumer and supplier is provided to a reward program administration system . The nature of data varies between embodiments. However at a general level it is indicative of the consumer for example by way of a consumer reward account identifier and indicative of one or more characteristics of the transaction such as the total transaction value . This data is processed at a rewards program server to determine a quantum value of reward points that should be allocated to the consumer. These reward points are allocated to the consumer in a consumer account database .

The terms supplier and consumer should be afforded broad interpretations. A supplier is any party that provides goods and or services to another. Likewise a consumer is any party that receives goods and or services from another party.

The reward program administration system interacts with a gaming administration system . This gaming system provides an arrangement whereby an entry fee is able to be exchanged for one or more entries in a gaming activity on the basis of a no risk profile i.e. entry fees are refundable regardless of whether an entry is a winning entry . In some cases system provides for other risk profiles in addition. However as will be appreciated from the discussion herein it is particularly advantageous to implement the present embodiments in the context of a no risk profile gaming activity. Furthermore a recurring entry option is selected such that a given entry fee essentially provides an ongoing opportunity to win a prize. This is discussed in more detail above in the section dealing with risk free gaming and no risk recurring entries.

In overview system obtains no risk recurring entries in a gaming activity from system for allocation to consumers such as consumer . In some embodiments entries are allocated to consumers in the sense that database is updated to associate a given consumer identifier with one or more entry identifiers for entries that have been allocated in whole or in part to the consumer.

System provides to system data indicative of entry fees and entry purchase instructions. Data is in some cases provided in respect of each appropriate item of data . For example each item of data is processed to determine an entry fee amount and this entry fee amount is applied as an entry fee in the context of system . In other cases data is provided periodically. For example system maintains a pool of entries for allocation to consumer accounts and periodically increases the size of that pool to ensure that sufficient entries are available for allocation to consumers over time.

System includes a gaming server which is responsible for the allocation of entries identification of winning entries and distribution of prizes. This server operates in conjunction with a gaming database .

System provides to system data indicative of entry outcome information refunds and prizes. In the case that an entry allocated to a given consumer is a winning entry the resulting prize is marked for distribution to that consumer. In some cases less than 100 of the prize is distributed to the consumer.

In broad terms consumers are allocated a number of no risk recurring entries corresponding to the number of reward points in their respective accounts. The number of entries increases as does the number of points. Likewise where points are redeemed for benefits the number of entries is decreased.

A transaction amount is provided by a consumer to a supplier in exchange for goods or services. A portion of amount is attributable to a supplier amount this essentially being the amount retained by the supplier less a portion that is provided to an reward program administrator as a reward program amount i.e. in the form of commission or the like . A portion of reward program amount is attributable to reward program income . Another portion is used to fund entry fees and is attributable to a gaming amount . A portion of the gaming amount is attributable to an investment amount and a portion is returned to the gaming amount. It will be appreciated that this provides a circulation for the generation of supplementary income in the form of a net investment return amount as discussed in more detail elsewhere in the present specification

A portion of the gaming amount is distributed as prizes . Another portion of the gaming amount relates to refunds and is attributable to reward program income .

Reward program income is used to fund benefits that are realised by the redemption of reward points. To this end a portion of reward program income is attributable to a redemption amount .

Taking a wider view of the above example it will be recognised that the administrator of a reward program essentially takes a small commission to cover the costs of providing benefits to consumers. In many conventional situations this small commission is held by the administrator until such a time as a redemption is made and then applied towards funding the benefit. In the present embodiments the commission or part thereof is used to fund no risk recurring entries in a gaming activity. This provides consumers with an ongoing opportunity to win prizes simply by having reward points in their account. At the same time it does not prevent consumers from redeeming their respective points for benefits in the conventional mariner. This provides a significant commercial advantage over conventional reward programs.

Step includes defining an entry fee amount for the transaction. In some cases the entry fee amount is based on the defined reward program credit. For example in one embodiment it is determined that each X number of reward points correspond to an entry fee amount of Y. In some cases the entry fee amount is based on data indicative of the transaction. For example in one embodiment it is determined that each X of transaction value correspond to an entry fee amount of Y. In further cases criteria such as reward program income and the like are used.

Step includes exchanging the entry fee amount for one or more no risk recurring entries. In some embodiments this includes providing the entry fee amount to a gaming administrator to obtain such entries. In other embodiments this is an internal procedure whereby a pool of pre obtained unallocated entries is maintained for the reward program and step effectively includes allocating to the relevant consumer a value of these entries corresponding to the entry fee amount. It will be appreciated that by such an approach the reward program holds a quantity of entries that are not at all times allocated to consumers. However this is not necessarily problematic given that there is a minimal overhead associated with holding entries. For example in some embodiments the cost of holding entries is defined by the opportunity cost associated with non investment of funds on hand.

Steps and respectively define the receipt of data indicative of a gaming outcome and the distribution of prizes if any to consumers. This loops over time as prize draws occur in respect of the gaming activity.

Step includes receiving from the consumer a request to redeem reward points for a benefit. In some cases this request is directly received for example the consumer uses reward points to make purchases via a website . In other cases it is indirectly received for example the consumer liaises with a third party who then passes on information regarding the redemption to an administrator of the reward program . Step includes determining an entry fee amount corresponding to the redemption amount. This is essentially a reverse of the process at step . That is whereas at step an entry fee amount is defined for a credit in reward points at step an entry fee amount is defined for a debit in reward points. This identifies the number of entries that must be refunded to cover the redemption request this many entries are un allocated from the consumer. In embodiments where the reward program administrator maintains a pool of entries the un allocated entries are returned to the pool. In other examples the entries are redeemed for refunds directly with an administrator of the gaming system.

It will be appreciated that the present reward program embodiments provide a valuable application for risk free gaming and correspondingly provide significant advantages in comparison to known reward programs.

As foreshadowed in some embodiments a flexible credit arrangement is implemented whereby a financial institution manages accounts on behalf of consumers on a cash at call basis. On the basis of funds maintained in these accounts for example by way of some or all of the interest derived or some or all of the capital the financial institution maintains entries in a risk free gaming activity optionally being an activity that provides subject matter being functionally similar to entries in a risk free gaming activity as discussed above . These entries are wholly or partially allocated between account holders thereby to provide the account holders with an opportunity to win prizes. The manner of allocation for the entries is generally based on the level of capital in a given account optionally in combination with additional factors. In some cases the risk free gaming activity is provided by a party other than the financial institution optionally being a lottery conducted by a third party in accordance with the teachings of PCT AU2007 000774 are a Bonus Bonds style arrangement. In the case of the latter a consumer is effectively able to particulate in a Bonus Bonds style arrangement by way of a conventional cash at call account.

Data is indicative of a transaction between account holder and third party . This data may be provided by either of account holder and third party depending on the nature of the transaction. For example where the third party is a retailer data may be provided by the third party via EFTPOS or another electronic payment arrangement to indicate that a payment has been made by the account holder. Where the third party is an employer data may be provided by the third party subject to an electronic funds transfer for transferring funds to the account holder. In some cases the account holder makes an electronic funds transfer via an online banking facility or the like thereby to provide data .

Data is provided to a financial institution system for example by way of an EFTPOS system or other electronic funds transfer arrangement. The nature of data varies between embodiments. However at a general level it is indicative of the account holder for example by way of an account identifier or payment card identifier for a payment card issued by the financial institution and indicative of one or more characteristics of the transaction such as the total transaction value . This data is processed at a banking server to determine a level e.g. quantum value of funds that should be allocated to the account holder or de allocated from the account holder. This level of funds is allocated to or de allocated from the account holder in a account holder account database .

The financial institution system interacts with a gaming administration system . This gaming system provides an arrangement whereby an entry fee is able to be exchanged for one or more entries in a gaming activity.

In overview system obtains entries in a gaming activity from system for allocation to account holders such as account holder . In some embodiments entries are allocated to account holders in the sense that database is updated to associate a given account holder identifier with one or more entry identifiers for entries that have been allocated in whole or in part to the account holder.

System provides to system data indicative of entry fees and entry purchase instructions for example in relation to no risk recurring entries . Data is in some cases provided in respect of each appropriate item of data . For example each item of data is processed to determine an entry fee amount and this entry fee amount is applied as an entry fee in the context of system . In other cases data is provided periodically. For example system maintains a pool of entries for allocation to account holder accounts and periodically increases the size of that pool to ensure that sufficient entries are available for allocation to account holders over time.

System includes a gaming server which is responsible for the allocation of entries identification of winning entries and distribution of prizes. This server operates in conjunction with a gaming database .

System provides to system data indicative of entry outcome information refunds and prizes. In the case that an entry allocated to a given account holder is a winning entry the resulting prize is marked for distribution to that account holder. In some cases less than 100 of the prize is distributed to the account holder.

It will be appreciated that the above described arrangement is suitable for providing a gaming activity in conjunction with flexible credit in accordance with various methods described herein.

As foreshadowed another form of flexible credit includes residual transaction amounts in the context of a residual transaction amount management system. Described herein are various systems and methods for managing residual transaction amounts. In some embodiments such systems and methods are implemented to allow a consumer to direct loose change resulting from a cash transaction towards an electronic account as opposed to receiving the loose change as physical legal tender. In some such embodiments the loose change of a given consumer is subsequently applied to at least partially fund one or more entries in a gaming activity essentially providing the consumer with an opportunity to win a prize. In most cases the loose change results from a transaction for goods and or services unrelated to the gaming activity itself and unrelated to gaming generally.

It will be appreciated that features and functionalities described in the context of residual transaction embodiments are equally applicable to other flexible credit arrangements in a broader context.

One embodiment provides a method for managing residual transaction amounts in which data is received this data being indicative of an account identifier and a residual transaction amount. Subsequently the method includes the step of querying a consumer account database to identify a consumer account corresponding to the account identifier and crediting the identified consumer account by an amount including at least a portion of the residual transaction amount on the basis of predetermined credit allocation criteria. The method at least in some embodiments also includes receiving data indicative of the outcome of a gaming activity and in response to the outcome of the gaming activity querying the consumer account database to identify one or more winning consumer accounts to which prize amounts are to be distributed. In some embodiments the method includes querying the consumer account database to identify one or more consumer accounts for which some or all of the respective credit is to be exchanged for one or more entries in a gaming activity or in some cases one or more partial entries in a gaming activity and subsequently exchanging that credit for the one or more entries or partial entries .

At a broad level in a transaction between a consumer and a supplier the consumer exchanges a transaction settlement amount for predefined goods or services. Essentially this transaction settlement amount corresponds to the specified or agreed price of the relevant goods or services. However in practice the consumer often provides to the supplier a payment amount which is greater than the transaction settlement amount the difference between the payment amount and the transaction settlement amount defining a change amount . The supplier reimburses the consumer for the change amount . Conventionally the supplier provides this change amount in cash i.e. in the form of coins notes or a combination of both .

In the present context the change amount is considered to comprise two components either of which might be zero in certain circumstances a residual transaction amount and another component. This other component for the present purposes is referred to as a cash return amount . The general notion elaborated on below is that the process of reimbursing the consumer for the change amount includes directly providing to the consumer a currency amount corresponding to the cash return amount assuming this to be non zero and arranging for the residual transaction amount to be managed on behalf of the consumer again assuming this to be non zero .

Although the precise definition of residual transaction amount varies between embodiments as further enunciated below for some implementations the general concept is for it to be defined by the loose change of a transaction. The term loose change essentially describes an amount of currency in coin and or note form for which the perceived inconvenience of physical carriage is perhaps greater than the immediate perceived value. It is appreciated that these are subjective considerations with perceptions of inconvenience and value varying from person to person. Ultimately determining an appropriate definition for the term residual transaction amount is a matter to be determined during implementation. Some general guidelines are provided below.

In some cases the residual transaction amount has a value equal to the change amount whereas in other embodiments it has a value of less than 100 of the change amount or even zero. In some embodiments the residual transaction amount is determined according to one of the following formulae RESIDUAL TRANSACTION AMOUNT CHANGE AMOUNT NEAREST LOWER WHOLE DOLLAR AMOUNT OR RESIDUAL TRANSACTION AMOUNT CHANGE AMOUNT NEAREST LOWER CURRENCY NOTE AMOUNT

It will be appreciated that in other embodiments other formulae may be used. In some embodiments only currency notes of over a predetermined value are considered for determinations using the latter formula for example in the context of US currency this might be the nearest lower currency note amount of 10 or greater . In some embodiments the consumer is provided with an option to designate a particular residual transaction amount between zero and the change amount. That is to consider the extremities in some cases the consumer can select a zero value for the residual transaction amount in which case the total value of the change amount would simply be returned to the consumer as cash in the usual way and in some cases the consumer can select the entire change amount to define the residual transaction amount in which case the total value of the change amount would be allocated for management as loose change according to an embodiment of the present invention.

Although a useful feature of certain embodiments is the ability to reduce the need for consumers to physically carry currency coins or low value currency notes specifically by defining a residual transaction amount as a loose change component of the change amount it is envisaged that in various cases the residual transaction amount might be either greater than or less than the next lowest currency note amount available as change for a given transaction. That is although various embodiments are described herein by reference to the concept of loose change it should be appreciated that this term describes a subset of what is defined by the term residual transaction amount and it follows that the scope of the present disclosure should by no means be limited to the concept of loose change .

There are particular advantages in defining the residual transaction amount by reference to the nature of legal tender in a particular jurisdiction. For example in circumstances where legal tender takes both note and coin form such as the United States and Australia the residual transaction amount is able to be defined by the portion of the residual transaction amount that is typically provided by way of currency coins and or low value currency notes. For instance in such situations the residual transaction amount is the change amount less the nearest lower whole dollar amount and is essentially loose change by one definition. However in some cases low value currency notes such as US 1 notes are also considered to be loose change . Conversely in some cases high value currency coins such as Australian 1 and 2 coins may not be considered to be loose change .

By way of example in jurisdictions where one or more units of coin currency have a significant value such as Australia where 1 and 2 currency coins are used and the lowest currency note value is 5 whether or not such coins are included in the residual transaction amount i.e. considered to be loose change varies between embodiments. For example in one embodiment based on the Australian situation the residual transaction amount is the change amount less the nearest lower whole dollar amount 1 and 2 coins are considered to be loose change and in another embodiment again based on the Australian situation the residual transaction amount is deemed to be the change amount less the nearest 5 integral multiple amount 1 and 2 coins are not considered to be loose change . In practice determinations for a particular currency system are able to be made pursuant to an arbitrary value based determination.

In some jurisdictions the lowest denomination of physical currency has a value greater than the minimum theoretical single unit of currency. This leads to a situation whereby at a practical level rounding is often applied to a change amount. For example in Australia the lowest denomination of physical currency is 0.05. If a consumer purchases an item for 0.98 by way of a 1 cash payment amount the change amount is in theory 0.02. However because the lowest denomination of physical currency is a five cent coin this change amount is in practice rounded down to 0.00 i.e. no change is provided . Alternatively it might be considered that the price of that item is rounded up to 1.00 again resulting in no change . On the other hand by some embodiments of the present invention a residual transaction amount of 0.02 is nevertheless defined. As will be appreciated from discussions below the consumer therefore does in fact receive 0.02 as change for the transaction this is credited to an electronic account in spite of the fact that in absence of system no physical change amount would have been received.

In some embodiments various rounding procedures are implemented including approaches whereby all change amounts are rounded down to the nearest set level such as to the nearest 0.05 with 0.96 to 0.99 being rounded to 0.95 rounded up to the nearest set level such as to the nearest 0.05 with 0.96 to 0.99 being rounded to 1.00 or to the closest set level such as to the nearest 0.05 with 0.93 to 0.97 being rounded to 0.95 .

As illustrated in data indicative of the residual transaction amount is transmitted along with data indicative of the consumer to system . This data is used to update a consumer account database under the control of a central server . In this way database maintains data indicative of the amount of credit on behalf of the consumer and on behalf of a plurality of other consumers. The actual residual transaction amount is provided for example by way of electronic credit transfer to a residual transaction amount account . In some cases account is defined by a plurality of distributed accounts.

System is configured to provide instructions for allowing the transfer of credit from account to predefined locations. In some embodiments the predefined locations include 

In the case of the latter in some circumstances credit is provided to the supplier at a time following distribution of the credit to the consumer by the supplier in cash form or as in store credit i.e. reimburse the supplier for monies already distributed to the consumer .

In some embodiments the intermediate account may be omitted and the respective credits may be transferred directly to individual consumer accounts for example

In the presently considered embodiments server provides consumers with an opportunity to participate in one or more gaming activities on the basis of their respective residual transaction amounts. In some embodiments such participation occurs on the basis of a predefined default situation whilst in other embodiments such participation is subject to a positive consumer selection.

In some embodiments residual transaction amounts are exchanged for entries in a gaming activity such as a lottery. Pursuant to the outcome of this gaming activity winning entries are identified and prizes which may or may not be financial in nature are distributed or marked for distribution among those consumers to whom winning entries were allocated.

In some cases there is a minimum spend level in a gaming activity for example a minimum entry cost of 1 this minimum spend level being greater than some or all of the residual transaction amounts. In some cases a consumer is allocated an entry only when the cumulative total of residual transaction amounts maintained on behalf of that consumer accrues to the minimum spend level for example this might occur following a plurality of transactions . In other embodiments consumers are syndicated together such that a single entry is essentially purchased by a plurality of consumers each owning a respective proportion of that entry corresponding to their relative share in the cost. In such cases in the event of a winning entry the prize would be shared among the associated entrants in the same respective proportions or optionally on some other predetermined basis.

In some embodiments the gaming activity is a traditional gaming activity by which the entry fees i.e. the portion of individual or cumulative residual transaction amounts exchanged for entries are placed fully at risk. However in other embodiments as described further below entry fees are refundable.

The terms supplier and consumer should be afforded broad interpretations in the context of the present invention. A supplier is any party that provides goods and or services to another party in exchange for a transaction settlement amount i.e. a supplier receives payment for goods and or services . Likewise a consumer is any party that receives goods and or services from another party in exchange for a transaction settlement amount i.e. a c consumer pays for goods and or services . Suppliers are predominately described herein by reference to the example of retailers however it should be appreciated that in all circumstances where the term retailer is used the broader term supplier should be equally applicable unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.

Provided below is a description of an exemplary hardware configuration for implementing some embodiments of the present invention. It should be appreciated that this is set out for the purposes of example only and should not be read as necessarily limiting the scope of the present disclosure.

It should be appreciated that server is illustrated as a single discrete component for the purposes of illustration only and in other embodiments server includes multiple discrete and in some cases distributed components. In the illustrated example server includes a processor coupled to a memory module that maintains software instructions for execution on processor . These software instructions allow server to perform various methods and provide various functionalities discussed herein. Also coupled to processor is a communications interface for allowing communication between server and client terminals . Server operates in conjunction with an account holder database which might also include distributed components. Database maintains data indicative of consumer accounts. In overview each consumer that makes use of system has an account defined in database . This account maintains information concerning the account such as a level of credit in the account user preferences associated with the account and or contact information for the consumer.

The consumer accounts do not in the present embodiments actually maintain any physical monetary credit. Rather they are virtual accounts optionally configured to include data indicative of a value in credit respectively attributable to the relevant consumers. Actual monies are maintained in one or more physical accounts such as interest bearing accounts and are optionally subjected to various investment procedures to derive investment income.

As illustrated client terminals include retailer client terminals and account holder client terminals although the latter are only present in select embodiments as discussed further below. An exemplary client terminal includes a processor coupled to a memory module that maintains software instructions for execution on processor . These software instructions allow terminal to perform various methods and provide various functionalities discussed herein. In some embodiments these software instructions are implemented in conjunction with software instructions for this purpose such as where a thin client or browser based approach is implemented . Also coupled to processor is a communications interface such as an Ethernet interface GSM other cellular communications module or other communications interface for allowing communication between server and client terminals .

Retailer terminals include any one or more of point of sale POS terminals discrete hardware devices coupled to POS terminals or the combination of such discrete hardware devices coupled with their respective POS terminals. The underlying concept is that a retailer terminal is configured to receive data indicative of a residual transaction amount such as a residual transaction amount itself or other data from which a residual transaction amount is able to be determined subject to further processing .

In the present embodiment a consumer is identifiable on the basis of an account identifier. This account identifier may be for example a numeric alphanumeric or alphabetic string that identifies a unique account in database .

Although each account identifier identifies only a single account in some embodiments multiple account identifiers identify a single account. For example in some embodiments a single consumer account is identified upon the presentation of either a credit card passcode or other loyalty card attributable to a given consumer. For instance a consumer presents a credit card for the purposes of providing an account identifier for one transaction and the same consumer presents a loyalty card for the purposes of providing an account identifier for another transaction. Assume for the sake of example that each of these transactions results in a residual transaction amount. These amounts would be managed as described herein by reference to different account identifiers stemming from the credit card and loyalty card respectively. However the consumer might wish for both of these amounts to go to a single consumer account essentially requiring an account that has multiple account identifiers. In some cases this is implemented by initially creating multiple consumer accounts and subsequently allowing a consumer to whom these accounts are commonly attributable to collate the accounts for example by way of options provided in a web based interface accessible via an account holder terminal .

Although some embodiments described herein are perhaps concerned to some extent with situations where residual transaction management occurs across a potentially large number of venues in some embodiments residual transaction is limited to a predetermined group of venues for example a single chain a group of subscribing participants or venues in a common mall or geographical area or even to a single venue. It will be appreciated that such issues generally hinge on commercial factors.

Step includes providing a signal indicative of the account identifier and residual transaction amount to the central server. In response at least in some embodiments the central server performs a step of crediting the identified consumer account by an amount including at least a portion of the residual transaction amount. In some embodiments this is the whole residual transaction amount. In some embodiments this is greater than the residual transaction amount for example where a consumer is allocated a supplementary contribution amount resulting for example from participation in distribution or collection marketing at the point of sale . In some embodiments this is less than the whole residual transaction amount for example where an operator of system deducts a service fee or commission amount which may assist in covering administration overheads .

The manner by which a consumer account is credited varies between embodiments. In some cases a credit level attributable to a given account is maintained solely in a relevant record in database . However in other embodiments this credit level is additionally or alternatively maintained on a machine readable writable token carried by the consumer such as a smartcard or rewritable RFID tag. For example in one embodiment consumers respective smartcards are the primary source of credit information and back end information in database is used primarily as a cross check or back up against fraud data corruption card loss and the like. In another embodiment the credit is solely stored on a smartcard or the like.

Step includes transferring for example by electronic credit transfer an amount in credit equal to the residual transaction amount to a predefined location such as an interest bearing account with a financial institution. It should be appreciated that this step of transferring need not include performing a physical fund transfer process and might simply involve providing a signal for initiating such a process.

Although the example of deals with a situation where credit transfer occurs after each transaction in other embodiments credit transfer occurs less frequently. For example credit transfer occurs only at the end of a predefined period as method of and step includes transferring an amount in credit equal to the sum of the residual transaction amounts for the period.

Both and deal with a situation where there is a predefined period which is often defined as a single business day or 24 hour period or optionally a longer or shorter period. A report is generated at the end of this period at step to allow reconciliation of monies that have been retained by a retailer as cash with credit that has been electronically transferred as residual transaction amounts. At a practical level at the end of a given period a retailer should have an amount in cash that exceeds the collective value of transaction settlement amounts for that period by the value of electronic credit transfers at step for that period having accounted for any cash withdrawals from electronic credit transfers for example by EFTPOS . It will be appreciated that such an approach facilitates a relatively straightforward reconciliation process.

In some embodiments retailer terminals are not only configured to allow the application of credits to consumer accounts but also to allow consumers to make withdrawals from those accounts. An example of such a procedure is provided by method of . Step includes receiving a withdrawal request indicative of an account identifier. A signal indicative of this account identifier is provided to the central server at such that a withdrawal amount can be verified. In some embodiments the withdrawal amount is equal to the total amount in credit available in the consumer account for that consumer as indicated by database . In other embodiments the consumer nominates a proposed withdrawal amount and the verification process ensures that the nominated amount is less than or equal to the total amount in credit available in the consumer account for that consumer as indicated by database . Data indicative of the verified withdrawal amount is received at step and this amount is subsequently provided to the consumer as cash or as credit against goods and or services in some embodiments only one of these options is available . In some embodiments the amount is directly or indirectly applied to a gaming machine for example to provide the relevant consumer with gaming credits at a poker machine slot machine. As in the examples of and method has a reporting period to allow for reconciliation. An electronic credit transfer is made by the central server to the relevant retailer either corresponding to each withdrawal request or corresponding to each period such that the retailer is reimbursed for withdrawal amounts paid to consumers.

In some embodiments consumers are additionally permitted to make supplementary deposits this being implemented in much the same manner as withdrawals albeit with the direction of electronic credit transfers reversed. In some embodiments a supplementary deposit may be applied at the time of a purchase transaction to increase the amount credited to the consumer over and above the residual transaction amount. In some embodiments a supplementary deposit may be made independently of any specific purchase transaction. In various embodiments deposits can be made at retailers via electronic kiosks and banking terminals or over the Internet. In one embodiment a consumer provides a collection of coins to an electronic kiosk which counts the coins and credits the consumer s account accordingly.

In some embodiments system is configured to provide consumers with access to gaming. For example in some cases this is internalized gaming whereby system wholly or partially provides a gaming activity wherein the players include a subset or all of those consumers for whom a consumer account is defined in database . In other cases this is externalized gaming whereby credit in consumer accounts is exchanged for gaming value in relation to a gaming activity provided wholly by an external party. That is in the case of externalized gaming system has no involvement beyond the allocation of entries or in some cases beyond providing instructions for the allocation of entries.

At a very general level a gaming activity occurs as follows i players are allocated entries in a gaming activity in exchange for respective entry fees ii one or more winning entries are identified on the basis of an event outcome and iii prizes are distributed to the or each player to whom a winning entry or entries were allocated. In the case of internalized gaming system is responsible for at least i and iii although the actual event outcome might be determined externally. For example in some cases system leverages an existing lottery system and yet provides internalised gaming in the sense that it is responsible for the distribution of prizes.

In one example of externalized gaming system is responsible for providing instructions to a gaming service provider such as a lottery agency to allocate entries to certain consumers and additionally responsible for providing entry fees corresponding to these instructions i.e. credit is exchanged for gaming value . The lottery service provider is then responsible for determining winners and distributing prizes. In this sense system queries the consumer account database to determine whether or not to exchange a portion of credit in a given consumer account for gaming value and in the case that the portion of credit is to be exchanged for gaming value provides a corresponding instruction to the lottery service provider.

For the purposes of discussion below there is a general focus on internalized gaming. However it should be appreciated at all times that other embodiments deal with externalized gaming.

In some embodiments these prizes are awarded by directly crediting the relevant consumer accounts however in other embodiments the prizes are awarded without using consumer accounts for example by mailing cheques or vouchers to the relevant consumers.

In the context of the present disclosure it is assumed that a gaming activity is an activity where multiple players provide respective entry fees in some of the present embodiments these entry fees being in whole or in part provided by way of residual transaction amounts. In exchange for the entry fees the players are subject to participation selections respectively allocated one or more entries. The term player as used herein refers to a provider of an entry fee typically being a consumer. The term should be construed broadly to include both human players non human players constructs or syndicates defined by a group of two or more human and or non human players such as a collaboration between human players and other legal entities such as corporations or trusts . In some cases the player is identified in a computing system by a unique identifier which might include a purpose defined identifier identifier based on personal information email address cellular telephone number or the like.

Step includes receiving from a retailer terminal data indicative of an account identifier and a credit amount. The received account identifier is validated at step to determine whether it identifies a consumer account in database and to identify that account. In the event that such an account cannot be identified a new account is optionally defined at step which may involve the acquisition of supplementary mandatory data. The identified or newly defined account is credited by the credit amount at step .

Step includes querying gaming settings for the credited account. These gaming settings essentially determine whether and how entries are to be allocated to a particular consumer. Initially default settings are implemented for each account which might or might not provide for the allocation of entries. In some embodiments a consumer is able to modify the gaming settings for his her account for example by way of a web or other interface accessible by way of a retailer terminal or account holder terminal. In the case of the latter in some embodiments consumers use substantially any Internet enabled device to access a website wherein having provided their account identifier and optionally additional identification verification information they are able to manage various settings and options for their accounts including the gaming settings. Several examples of gaming settings are considered below 

Decision includes determining whether or not to allocate entries on the basis of the credit amount and gaming settings. Subject to this decision entries are allocated at step .

Whilst the example of deals with a situation where entries are allocated at the time of crediting a particular account in other embodiments entries are allocated periodically subject to a gaming period as shown by method of . In this method a gaming entry allocation period starts at step . In overview all entries for a particular instance of a gaming activity defined for example by a single prize determination event are allocated during this period. This includes at step querying an account database to determine for each account the level of credit in that account and gaming settings in place for that account. Step includes for each account allocating none or more entries based on the applicable level of credit and gaming settings. The gaming entry allocation period ends at .

The process of allocation generally includes allocating none or more entry identifiers to the consumers for example by updating the relevant consumer accounts to include such entry identifiers. In some cases there is also a physically manifested allocation whereby the consumer is provided with a receipt describing the entries.

The regularity of prize determination varies between embodiments with the possibility of daily weekly monthly or other periodic draws. In some cases there are multiple tiers of draw such as major and minor which operate on respective determination schedules.

In the context of the present disclosure there is discussion of players being allocated entries and disclosure of players being provided entries. The terms allocated and provided are regarded as synonymous in this regard. Furthermore neither of these terms should imply a requirement that a player actually physically receives any entries although equally they may do so only that the entries are notionally allocated to that player.

Although players are considered to provide respective entry fees it will be appreciated that in some instances a single player provides multiple entry fees on multiple occasions.

In some cases there is a minimum spend level in a gaming activity. For example there is a minimum level of financial consideration in exchange for which one or more entries are able to be obtained. Often this minimum spend level is determined such that it is equal to the smallest unit of currency for a jurisdiction i.e. 0.01 in the case of the United States and Australia such that X entries are available for a price of 0.01 wherein X 1 but no entries are available for a price of less than 0.01 . However in some embodiments that is not the case. For example in one embodiment a minimum spend level is set by a third party gaming operator that conducts gaming independently of a system such as system or system that minimum spend level being greater than the smallest unit of currency for the relevant jurisdiction.

In some embodiments where the minimum spend level is greater than the smallest unit of currency for a jurisdiction a syndication process is used such that consumers having amounts of less than the minimum spend level can nevertheless compete in a gaming activity. In overview credits available in consumer accounts for a plurality of consumers are syndicated together to provide an entry fee of value at least equal to the minimum spend level or in some cases an integral multiple of the minimum spend level and one or more entries are allocated on the basis of that entry fee. Conceptually these entries are partially owned by each of the plurality of syndicated consumers. In this way the loose change of a given consumer is effectively applied to partially fund one or more entries in a gaming activity.

In implementing syndication it is initially necessary to form syndicates. The manner by which syndicate formation is administered varies between embodiments. Several examples are discussed below 

It will be appreciated that these examples are provided for the sake of explanation only and should not be regarded as limiting in any way. Those skilled in the art will recognise numerous equivalent and alternative approaches.

Generally speaking in the case that a syndicated entry wins a prize that prize is shared among those consumers that contributed to the relevant entry fee the sharing preferably being in accordance with the consumers relative contributions. For example assume that the minimum spend level is 1.00 and a single entry is allocated in exchange for 1.00. Further assume that for a given syndicated entry Consumer A contributes 0.10 Consumer B contributes 0.75 and Consumer C contributes the remaining 0.15. The relative contributions for these consumers are respectively 10 75 and 15 . Should that entry win a prize the prize is shared among the consumers in accordance with those percentages.

It will be appreciated that syndication allows small amounts of credit to be applied in a useful manner which might not have otherwise been possible. Given the present context being management of typically small amounts of credit this is a particularly advantageous result.

It will be appreciated from the foregoing description that the term risk free gaming essentially describes a form of gaming whereby entry fees are placed subject to a no risk risk profile that is 100 of the entry fee is refundable. In some embodiments consumer accounts are implemented on the basis of a default position of full participation in risk free gaming. In some such embodiments there are no other options i.e. all consumers have full participation in risk free gaming .

It is presently considered that risk free gaming is particularly advantageous in the context of a system for managing residual transaction amounts. In particular it is thought that consumer willingness to make use of a residual transaction amount management system will be enhanced on the basis of the credit diverted being later redeemable substantially in full. That is there is no substantial cost to the consumer in using the system other than perhaps a commission service fee or other administration charge . In some embodiments it could be considered that there is also an opportunity cost to the consumer on the basis of the time value of the residual transaction amounts under management. In the context of the present invention however most consumers would regard this cost as negligible. Moreover in some embodiments actual or notional interest could be applied to the consumer accounts. In cases where there is no substantial cost incurred the consumer s decision to participate is relatively uncomplicated. Such a decision becomes more difficult in the case that the consumer may have to place credit at risk for the purpose of gaming. However in the case of risk free gaming this complication is averted. Indeed the net result is essentially a system for managing residual transaction amounts for the primary purpose of accumulation without the hitherto attendant inconveniences while providing as a further benefit a chance to win prizes. Given that a residual transaction management system is at a practical level typically implemented by a supplier for the purpose of consumer enticement and to provide a competitive advantage over other suppliers who do not implement such a system the application of risk free gaming is particularity advantageous.

The manner by which prizes are funded for risk free gaming activities varies between embodiments. In the case of traditional gaming activities funding is a relatively straightforward affair with the prizes being predominately funded by entry fees i.e. residual transaction amounts . However funding is less straightforward in the cases of no risk and partial risk gaming. In some such cases prizes are funded in whole or in part by supplementary contributions . The supplementary contribution amount provided by or on behalf of a given player in some embodiments includes components having values corresponding to any one or more of

This is by no means an exclusive list and alternative embodiments make use of a wider range of possible methodologies and amounts. In overview supplementary contribution amounts are combined into a prize pool for funding prizes in relation to the gaming activity. The relative magnitudes of these amounts as between players preferably affect some characteristic of the gaming activity the entries for the gaming activity submitted on behalf of respective players or the manner in which the respective players otherwise participate in the gaming activity.

There is discussion in the above examples of gross amounts and net amounts. The terms gross and net are used in a general descriptive sense only. In particular the term gross refers to an amount derived by the gaming operator and the term net refers to an amount that is added as the supplementary contribution amount. In some cases the net amount is the corresponding gross amount less any applicable taxes levies duties commissions or operator charges. In some cases the gross and net amounts are the same. In other cases there is no direct nexus between the gross and net amounts.

In some cases consumers are able to increase their respective likelihoods of winning a prize by taking active steps to increase their respective supplementary contributions. In some cases this supplementary contribution simply results in additional entries being allocated i.e. no credit to consumer account however in other embodiments consumers receive a direct financial reward for making a supplementary contribution i.e. a credit to the consumer account . For example in one embodiment a player who agrees to respond to a survey question at the point of sale receives an additional credit amount in conjunction with the residual transaction amount this additional credit amount being considered for the allocation of entries and assuming it is not placed at risk subject to entry settings can be redeemed via a withdrawal request.

In some embodiments particularly embodiments involving risk free gaming prizes are funded out of an investment return derived from temporarily holding the collective loose change of a plurality of consumers. That is the loose change of these consumers is maintained in one or more interest bearing accounts or otherwise invested to generate an investment return and a portion of this return is distributed as one or more prizes.

In some of embodiments the number of entries allocated to a given consumer takes into account the contribution made by that consumer either towards a prize pool or towards the funding of entry purchases. For example in some embodiments a consumer who makes a greater contribution to a prize pool is allocated a correspondingly greater share in entries. In some embodiments a consumer who makes a greater contribution to the purchase of entries from a separate gaming system is allocated a correspondingly greater share in entries.

In some embodiments a consumer is able to obtain or at least provide funding in relation to one or more entries or a portion of one or more entries without placing and entry fee at risk and instead by allowing funds to be invested or by participating in marketing activities. Such approaches allow a consumer so as to derive a supplementary contribution amount and therefore make a non zero contribution even though no funds are placed at risk in fact these funds in essence remain available to the consumer as transactable flexible credit or as reward point or the like which correspond to transactable flexible credit . In a practical example consumers are in this way essentially able to be provided free entries in exchange for viewing advertisements or participating in market research activities. The number of entries allocated to a given consumer is as in various other examples presently considered preferably related to the supplementary contribution amount for that consumer.

As foreshadowed in some embodiments the supplementary income is practically or notionally funded by subjecting some or all of the entry fees collected from consumers or held directly or notionally on behalf of consumers in relation to transactable flexible credit to an investment procedure for a period of time the supplementary income including some or all of the investment return derived from that investment procedure or an amount corresponding to the value of some or all of that investment return.

Any references herein to investment return or investment income are to be interpreted as references to net investment return and net investment income unless specifically stated otherwise. In practice the investment procedure results in the derivation of a gross investment return and various deductions such as taxes levies duties commissions investment charges broker fees operator charges and so on are taken from this gross investment return. The term net investment return defines a remainder of the gross investment return this net investment return being added to the prize pool as some or all of the supplementary income.

The terms taxes and duties as used herein are intended to encompass any relevant Federal State and or local government taxes duties or imposts as well as levies or charges applied by intermediaries or other third parties connected with the gaming activity that are essentially non discretionary in so far as the gaming operators or consumers are concerned.

The terms invest investing investment and the like as used herein are intended to be afforded a broad interpretation covering the utilisation or disposition of funds or valuable assets in a general sense. Examples include but are not limited to investment in any financial or real asset or property of any type whether securitised or otherwise with value denominated in any currency or combination of currencies whether listed on a public trading exchange or unlisted on any such exchange including the following as well as warrants options derivatives deferred purchase contracts installment receipts and the like over any of the following 

Further it should be appreciated that for the purposes of the present invention any investment procedure or other methodology for generating supplementary contributions for or on behalf of consumers may be entirely invisible from the consumers perspectives being managed as a back office operation by or on behalf of the gaming operator. Indeed in many embodiments this is the preferred approach so as to shield the consumers from the detail of potentially complex investment and risk management strategies which might otherwise detract from the experience and enjoyment of the primary gaming activity itself. This is an important distinction with respect to some forms of investment product in which an understanding of transparent the underlying investment mechanics is primary and any associated gaming activity is of secondary significance.

The funds are combined into a funding pool . This funding pool includes non investment capital and investment capital although in some embodiments the former has a zero value. Investment capital is provided to an investment vehicle optionally by way of electronic funds transfer. In some embodiments the entry fees or parts thereof are transferred substantially directly to this vehicle. Non investment capital is added to a prize pool .

At the end of a predetermined investment period investment capital is added to prize pool . A gross investment return is received and from this an administrator commission is deducted along with other deductions such as taxes levies duties investment costs and so on thereby to define a net investment return . Net investment return is added to prize pool that prize pool being at an appropriate time distributed among players including contributor . The contributor distributes prizes among consumers who participate in a flexible credit arrangement.

In the example of prizes are funded out of the funding pool as well as investment income. However in some circumstances all of the funding pool is intended to be returned to the contributor in due course as consumers flexible credit is not placed at risk . schematically illustrates an exemplary gaming administration system according to one embodiment where the prize pool is defined by investment income.

A contributor provides funds to system . For example these funds may be provided by consumers or held on behalf of consumers in accordance with a flexible credit arrangement as discussed further above.

It will be appreciated that various embodiments of the present invention are technically implemented using various combinations of hardware and software. Some of these are considered below.

Memory module is configured for maintaining software instructions which when executed on processor allow server to perform various methods including but not limited to one or more of the methods described herein.

The term communications interface or interface should be read broadly to include any component or group of components including one or more of a network interface such as an Ethernet interface or other wired wireless network interface modem other interfaces configured to allow communication between server and another processing platform ports such as serial or parallel ports for receiving data from or providing data to input output devices such as keyboards scanners and printers.

As illustrated server is coupled to a consumer account database . Although in the context of the present illustrations this database is shown as being a single discrete component in alternate embodiments it is defined by a plurality of distributed components optionally including memory modules of one or more servers such as server .

In some embodiments such as that of a plurality of like or similar servers are coupled to a common database . For example servers are provided at distributed locations with a database provided at a centralised location.

Database maintains data indicative of transactions and account statuses which includes in various embodiments data indicative of the level of flexible credit held by consumers and the allocation of entries between consumers.

As illustrated terminal includes a processor communications interface and memory module which maintains software instructions .

In overview a consumer interacts with terminal to complete a transaction having a flexible credit component. In some embodiments this is a direct interaction whereas in other embodiments it is an indirect interaction whereby a terminal operator interacts with terminal on behalf of the consumer. The consumer provides identifying information which is in the present embodiment read into terminal from a ID card by way of a card reader such as a magnetic strip arrangement . This allows terminal to provide to server data indicative of a flexible credit adjustment.

As illustrated terminal includes a processor communications interface and memory module which maintains software instructions . A card reader is also coupled to processor . In overview to redeem flexible credit prizes a consumer presents an ID card. Terminal then performs a query process to determine whether the ID card is indicative of a level of flexible credit. This in some cases requires communications with server . Prizes and or refunds are provided to the consumer where appropriate. In some cases these are provided by cash and in some cases by way of a further ticket or other indication of entitlement that is redeemable for cash or cheque either upon presentation or at some predetermined future point in time. In further cases the consumer nominates a location to which the prize refund should be delivered such as a physical address or bank account. In some cases the consumer arranges for the prize refund to be credited to a specified bank credit card account.

In some embodiments redemption is automated. For example a consumer is invited to create a user account this account including details of a bank account to which prizes refunds are to be credited and this crediting occurs automatically.

In some embodiments some or all of the general functionalities of either or both of terminal and are made available to a consumer via a personal computing platform such as a desktop computer laptop computer cellular telephone PDA gaming console or other platform. In some such embodiments consumers access a website over the Internet to purchase goods services or otherwise complete transactions for example by selecting risk profiles via a selection interface provided by a web page viewable through a web browser application and providing funds by way of an online payment procedure. In other embodiments consumers download proprietary software as an alternative to a browser based approach.

In some embodiments transactions are completed via online approaches for example via a website accessible over the Internet and in store approaches for example at a retail location having a sales terminal and or redemption terminal . In some cases different rules apply for transactions completed online as opposed to transactions completed in store.

The approach of is to provide a website on the Internet for interfacing the client terminals with the administration server. The approach of is to provide a connection such as a VPN connection over the Internet or another network such as a LAN or WAN for interfacing the client terminals with the administration server.

Unless specifically stated otherwise it should be appreciated that throughout the specification terms such as processing computing calculating determining analyzing or the like in some embodiments refer to the action and or processes of a computer or computing system or similar electronic computing device that manipulate and or transform data represented as physical such as electronic quantities into other data similarly represented as physical quantities.

In a similar manner the term processor may refer to any device or portion of a device that processes electronic data e.g. from registers and or memory to transform that electronic data into other electronic data that e.g. may be stored in registers and or memory. A computer or a computing machine or a computing platform may include one or more processors.

The methodologies described herein are in some embodiments performable by one or more processors that accept computer readable also called machine readable code containing a set of instructions that when executed by one or more of the processors carry out at least one of the methods described herein or a variation on at least one of the methods described herein. Any processor capable of executing a set of instructions sequential or otherwise that specify actions to be taken should be included. Thus one example is a typical processing system that includes one or more processors. Each processor may include one or more of a CPU a graphics processing unit and a programmable DSP unit. The processing system further may include a memory subsystem including main RAM and or a static RAM and or ROM. A bus subsystem may be included for communicating between the components. The processing system further may be a distributed processing system with processors coupled by a network. If the processing system requires a display such a display may be included e.g. an liquid crystal display LCD or a cathode ray tube CRT display. If manual data entry is required the processing system also includes an input device such as one or more of an alphanumeric input unit such as a keyboard a pointing control device such as a mouse and so forth. The term memory unit as used herein if clear from the context and unless explicitly stated otherwise also encompasses a storage system such as a disk drive unit. The processing system in some configurations may include a sound output device and a network interface device. The memory subsystem thus includes a computer readable carrier medium that carries computer readable code e.g. software including a set of instructions to cause performing when executed by one or more processors one of more of the methods described herein. Note that when the method includes several elements e.g. several steps no ordering of such elements is implied unless specifically stated. The software may reside in the hard disk or may also reside completely or at least partially within the RAM and or within the processor during execution thereof by the computer system. Thus the memory and the processor also constitute computer readable carrier medium carrying computer readable code.

Furthermore a computer readable carrier medium may form or be includes in a computer program product.

In alternative embodiments the one or more processors operate as a standalone device or may be connected e.g. networked to other processor s in a networked deployment the one or more processors may operate in the capacity of a server or a user machine in server user network environment or as a peer machine in a peer to peer or distributed network environment. The one or more processors may form a personal computer PC a tablet PC a set top box STB a Personal Digital Assistant PDA a cellular telephone a web appliance a network router switch or bridge or any machine capable of executing a set of instructions sequential or otherwise that specify actions to be taken by that machine.

Note that while some diagrams only show a single processor and a single memory that carries the computer readable code those in the art will understand that many of the components described above are included but not explicitly shown or described in order not to obscure the inventive aspect. For example while only a single machine is illustrated the term machine or device shall also be taken to include any collection of machines that individually or jointly execute a set or multiple sets of instructions to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed herein.

At least one embodiment of each of the methods described herein is in the form of a computer readable carrier medium carrying a set of instructions such as a computer program that are for execution on one or more processors such as one or more processors that are part of an information system . Thus as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art embodiments of the present invention may be embodied as a method an apparatus such as a special purpose apparatus an apparatus such as a data processing system or a computer readable carrier medium such as a computer program product . The computer readable carrier medium carries computer readable code including a set of instructions that when executed on one or more processors cause the processor or processors to implement a method. Accordingly aspects of the present invention may take the form of a method an entirely hardware embodiment an entirely software embodiment or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects. Furthermore the present invention may take the form of carrier medium such as a computer program product on a computer readable storage medium carrying computer readable program code embodied in the medium.

The software may further be transmitted or received over a network via a network interface device or other communications interface. While the carrier medium is shown in an exemplary embodiment to be a single medium the term carrier medium should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media such as a centralized or distributed database and or associated caches and servers that store the one or more sets of instructions. The term carrier medium shall also be taken to include any medium that is capable of storing encoding or carrying a set of instructions for execution by one or more of the processors and that cause the one or more processors to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the present invention. A carrier medium may take many forms including but not limited to non volatile media volatile media and transmission media. Non volatile media includes for example optical magnetic disks and magneto optical disks. Volatile media includes dynamic memory such as main memory. Transmission media includes coaxial cables copper wire and fiber optics including the wires that comprise a bus subsystem. Transmission media also may also take the form of acoustic or light waves such as those generated during radio wave and infrared data communications. For example the term carrier medium shall accordingly be taken to included but not be limited to solid state memories a computer product embodied in optical and magnetic media a medium bearing a propagated signal detectable by at least one processor of one or more processors and representing a set of instructions that when executed implement a method a carrier wave bearing a propagated signal detectable by at least one processor of the one or more processors and representing the set of instructions a propagated signal and representing the set of instructions and a transmission medium in a network bearing a propagated signal detectable by at least one processor of the one or more processors and representing the set of instructions.
