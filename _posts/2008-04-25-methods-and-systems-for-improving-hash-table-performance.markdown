title: Methods and systems for improving hash table performance
abstract: Methods and systems for generating a hashcode for a hash table are provided to improve the hash table performance. A particular method includes receiving an input of a key; applying a hash function to the key to generate an incoming hashcode of the key; encoding a key type into the incoming hashcode to generate a first hashcode; and storing the first hashcode. A particular method includes encoding the key type into at least one bit of a bucket index portion of the incoming hashcode.
