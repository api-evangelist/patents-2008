title: Systems and methods for presenting information based on publisher-selected labels
abstract: Publishers define relationships between their own content items (e.g., World Wide Web pages) and content items created or maintained by other publishers. A central namespace manager provides grouping labels that publishers insert into their content items. Content items having matching grouping labels are identified as related. Different classes of grouping labels can be used to define different types of relationships, and multiple classes of grouping labels can co-exist. Grouping labels are made available to an information server such as a search server, which uses the labels in identifying content items related to a currently displayed content item.

The present application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 11 231 632 entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR PRESENTING INFORMATION BASED ON PUBLISHER SELECTED LABELS filed on Sep. 20 2005 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 421 441 by Alwin Fei Quen Chan et al. the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The present disclosure is related to the following commonly assigned co pending U.S. patent applications 

The present invention relates in general to information delivery systems and methods and in particular to systems and methods for presenting information based at least in part on publisher selected labels. The labels are applied to content items by publishers and used to identify related content items in various situations.

The World Wide Web Web as its name suggests is a decentralized global collection of interlinked information generally in the form of pages that may contain text images and or media content related to virtually every topic imaginable. A user who knows or finds a uniform resource locator URL for a page can provide that URL to a Web client generally referred to as a browser and view the page almost instantly. Since Web pages typically include links also referred to as hyperlinks to other pages finding URLs is generally not difficult.

What is difficult for most users is finding URLs for pages that are of interest to them. The sheer volume of content available on the Web has turned the task of finding a page relevant to a particular interest into what may be the ultimate needle in a haystack problem. To address this problem an industry of search providers e.g. Yahoo MSN Google has evolved. A search provider typically maintains a database of Web pages in which the URL of each page is associated with information e.g. keywords category data etc. reflecting its content. The search provider also maintains a search server that hosts a search page or site on the Web. The search page provides a form into which a user can enter a query that usually includes one or more terms indicative of the user s interest. Once a query is entered the search server accesses the database and generates a list of hits typically URLs for pages whose content matches keywords derived from the user s query. This list is provided to the user. Since queries can often return hundreds thousands or in some cases millions of hits search providers have developed sophisticated algorithms for ranking the hits i.e. determining an order for displaying hits to the user such that the pages most relevant to a given query are likely to appear near the top of the list. Typical ranking algorithms take into account not only the keywords and their frequency of occurrence but also other information such as the number of other pages that link to the hit page popularity of the hit page among users and so on.

To further facilitate use of their services some search providers now offer search toolbar add ons for Web browser programs. A search toolbar typically provides a text box into which the user can type a query and a Submit button for submitting the query to the search provider s server. Once installed by the user the search toolbar is generally visible no matter what page the user is viewing enabling the user to enter a query at any time without first navigating to the search provider s Web site. Searches initiated via the toolbar are processed in the same way as searches initiated at the provider s site the only difference is that the user is spared the step of navigating to the search provider s site.

One technique for helping a user find content is to provide an interface via which the user can request related pages. Pages can be identified as related based on similarity of their content to that of the currently viewed page and or whether the pages are published by the same entity. As implemented in existing systems neither technique is very reliable.

Existing algorithms for identifying related pages based on similarity of content generally rely on overlap of textual elements words phrases etc. between the current page and the related page. The best matches according to such algorithms have the most overlap with the current page however the pages with the most overlap are often least interesting to the user who typically wants to find pages with different information on the same subject. Determining whether two pages relate to the same subject is a difficult task as it requires determining the subject of each page which might or might not be evident from the words used.

Identifying pages published by the same entity is sometimes easier but is of limited help to the user. The publisher s own pages can sometimes be identified by URL on the assumption that URLs beginning with the same domain name are commonly owned but this assumption is not always reliable. For instance some domains host content created by multiple independent publishers and some publishers use multiple domains. Further domain name matching does not provide a way to identify affiliates of a publisher since the affiliates typically use different domains.

Therefore it would be desirable to provide systems and methods for more efficiently identifying related content.

 Embodiments of the present invention provide systems and methods allowing publishers to define relationships between their own content items e.g. World Wide Web pages and content items created or maintained by other publishers. A central namespace manager provides grouping labels that publishers can insert into their content items and content items having matching grouping labels are identified as related. Different classes of grouping labels can be used to define different types of relationships and multiple classes of grouping labels can co exist. For instance in one embodiment one class of grouping labels is used to indicate a personal or business connection between or among publishers and another class is used to indicate a subject matter relationship between content items. Grouping labels are advantageously not displayed when the content item is displayed for a user but are made available to an information server such as a search server which uses the labels in identifying content items related to a currently displayed content item. For example if a user viewing a first content item requests similar or related items a grouping label included in the first content item can be used to select appropriate items. In another embodiment in line or pop up advertisements to be displayed while the user is viewing a target content item are selected based at least in part on a grouping label included in the target content item. In still another embodiment grouping labels included by publishers in their content items are used to construct a subject matter directory of content items.

According to one aspect of the present invention a method for providing information from a corpus of content items to a client is provided. A number of grouping labels are defined where each grouping label is includable by publishers in content items in a corpus. An index is automatically built with the index being configured to identify for each of the plurality of grouping labels each of the content items in the corpus that includes that grouping label. A request is received from a client for identification of content items related to a first content item with the request including a first one of the plurality of grouping labels extracted from the first content item. The index is accessed to identify a second content item having the first one of the plurality of grouping labels included therein and a reference to the second content item is returned to the client. In some embodiments the grouping labels are included in a contextual search code block that is part of the content item and are extracted from the code block when the user requests related content.

Various classes or types of grouping labels can be defined. For instance in some embodiments each grouping label corresponds to a group of affiliated publishers and in other embodiments each grouping label corresponds to a category identifier for content items. Multiple classes of grouping labels may coexist in one embodiment and a given content item might include a grouping label from any all or none of the classes at the publisher s discretion.

Where the grouping labels correspond to category identifiers that form a hierarchical taxonomy a directory of content items might be built based on the hierarchical taxonomy of category identifiers each content item that has at least one grouping label included therein can be listed in the directory under each category identifier that corresponds to one of the grouping labels included in that content item.

The index can be built in various ways. For instance if the content items are Web pages a Web crawler can be operated to locate and process a plurality of Web pages. During processing of each Web page the presence of any of the plurality of grouping labels is detected and information about the detected grouping labels for each Web page is added to a page index built by the Web crawler. The page index can be inverted to create an index of the content items by grouping label.

In another embodiment the index is built as requests are received from clients. For instance in response to a request for content related to the first content item the first content item can be added to the index in association with the first grouping label.

According to another aspect of the present invention a method of retrieving information is provided. A client system displays a first content item the first content item including an interface element operable to request related content the first content item further including a first grouping label associated with the interface element. In response to user operation of the interface element the client system transmits a request for related content to a server system the request including the grouping label. The client system receives a reference to a related content item selected by the server system in response to the request the related content item also includes the first grouping label. The client system displays the reference to the related content item.

According to still another aspect of the present invention a method for providing information from a corpus of content items to a client is provided. A number of grouping labels are defined with each grouping label corresponding to a node in a hierarchical taxonomy of content categories and each grouping label being includable by a plurality of publishers in a plurality of content items in a corpus. A directory is automatically built the directory is configured to identify for each of the grouping labels each of the content items in the corpus that includes that grouping label. A client interface is provided the client interface including controls for navigating among the nodes in the hierarchical taxonomy of content categories upon navigation to a particular node in the hierarchical taxonomy the client interface presents a listing of at least some of the content items identified in the directory as including the grouping label that corresponds to the particular node in the hierarchical taxonomy.

The directory can be built in various ways. In one embodiment building the directory includes determining for each of the plurality of grouping labels an order of presentation for the content items in the corpus that include that one of the grouping labels. The order of presentation may be based at least in part on user ratings of the content items in the corpus that include the one of the grouping labels a relevance score relative to a category name that corresponds to the grouping label determined for each content item that includes the one of the grouping labels and or other information about the content items.

According to a further aspect of the present invention an information retrieval and communication system includes a namespace data store an index data store and an information server. The namespace data store is configured to store a plurality of grouping labels with each grouping label being includable by publishers in content items in a corpus. The index data store is configured to store an index identifying for each of the grouping labels stored in the namespace data store each of the content items in the corpus that includes that grouping label. The information server includes a client interface module and an index interface module. The client interface module is configured to receive requests from a client computer system for identification of content items related to a starting content item where each request includes a grouping label extracted from the starting content item. The index interface module is configured to access the index to identify a second content item having the grouping label extracted from the starting content item included therein and the client interface module is further configured to return a reference to the second content item to the client computer system.

In some embodiments the system also includes a namespace manager communicably coupled to the namespace data store and configured to provide a namespace interface configured to support searching the plurality of grouping labels the namespace interface being accessible to the publishers. The namespace manager can also be configured to generate a new grouping label in response to a request from one of the plurality of publishers. In some embodiments the namespace data store is further configured to store in association with each of the grouping labels a characteristic value and wherein the namespace manager is further configured to support searching for a desired characteristic value. The characteristic value might be e.g. a category name or other term descriptive of subject matter of a content item.

In other embodiments the system includes an index builder configured to create the index and store the index in the index data store. For instance the index builder might be configured to navigate from one content item to another and generate index information for each content item to which the index builder navigates. In other embodiments the information server is further configured to maintain a log of requests received from client systems the log including an identifier of each starting content item in association with the grouping label extracted from the starting content item and the index builder is further configured to generate index information from the log.

The following detailed description together with the accompanying drawings will provide a better understanding of the nature and advantages of the present invention.

Embodiments of the present invention provide systems and methods allowing publishers to define relationships between their own content items e.g. World Wide Web pages and content items created or maintained by other publishers. A central namespace manager provides grouping labels that publishers can insert into their content items and content items having matching grouping labels are identified as related. Different classes of grouping labels can be used to define different types of relationships and multiple classes of grouping labels can co exist. For instance in one embodiment one class of grouping labels is used to indicate a personal or business connection between or among publishers and another class is used to indicate a subject matter relationship between content items. Grouping labels are advantageously not displayed when the content item is displayed for a user but are made available to an information server such as a search server which uses the labels in identifying content items related to a currently displayed content item. For example if a user viewing a first content item requests similar or related items a grouping label included in the first content item can be used to select appropriate items. In another embodiment in line or pop up advertisements to be displayed while the user is viewing a target content item are selected based at least in part on a grouping label included in the target content item. In still another embodiment grouping labels included by publishers in their content items are used to construct a subject matter directory of content items.

Several elements in the system shown in include conventional well known elements that need not be explained in detail here. For example client system could include a desktop personal computer workstation laptop personal digital assistant PDA cell phone or any WAP enabled device or any other computing device capable of interfacing directly or indirectly to the Internet. Client system typically runs a browsing program such as Microsoft s Internet Explorer browser Netscape Navigator browser Mozilla Firefox browser Opera browser or a WAP enabled browser in the case of a cell phone PDA or other wireless device or the like allowing a user of client system to access process and view information and pages available to it from server systems to over Internet . Client system also typically includes one or more user interface devices such as a keyboard a mouse touch screen pen or the like for interacting with a graphical user interface GUI provided by the browser on a display e.g. monitor screen LCD display etc. in conjunction with pages forms and other information provided by server systems to or other servers. The present invention is suitable for use with the Internet which refers to a specific global internetwork of networks. However it should be understood that other networks can be used instead of or in addition to the Internet such as an intranet an extranet a virtual private network VPN a non TCP IP based network any LAN or WAN or the like.

According to one embodiment client system and all of its components are operator configurable using an application including computer code run using a central processing unit such as an Intel Pentium processor AMD Athlon processor or the like or multiple processors. Computer code for operating and configuring client system to communicate process and display data and media content as described herein is preferably downloaded and stored on a hard disk but the entire program code or portions thereof may also be stored in any other volatile or non volatile memory medium or device as is well known such as a ROM or RAM or provided on any media capable of storing program code such as a compact disk CD medium a digital versatile disk DVD medium a floppy disk and the like. Additionally the entire program code or portions thereof may be transmitted and downloaded from a software source e.g. from one of server systems to SON to client system over the Internet or transmitted over any other network connection e.g. extranet VPN LAN or other conventional networks using any communication medium and protocols e.g. TCP IP HTTP HTTPS Ethernet or other conventional media and protocols .

It should be appreciated that computer code for implementing aspects of the present invention can be C C HTML XML Java JavaScript etc. code or any other suitable scripting language e.g. VBScript or any other suitable programming language that can be executed on client system or compiled to execute on client system . In some embodiments no code is downloaded to client system and needed code is executed by a server or code already present at client system is executed.

Content servers to store content items such as content item e.g. Web pages images media files that can be provided on demand to client system via Internet . Content servers to may support various information sharing protocols such as HTTP and or other known protocols. It is to be understood that any number N of content servers may be present and each content server may provide any number of content items. Further client access to some or all of the content items may be limited to authorized users as is known in the art.

Content items are created and stored at content servers to by publishers as used herein the term publisher refers to any entity including persons organizations and or computer systems responsible for creating and or maintaining a content item on any one of content servers to . In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention publishers can select grouping labels such as the Qgroup and Qcat labels shown in content item to be included in their content items. As described below grouping labels can be provided to the server and or client systems of and used to determine which content items are related to each other. In some embodiments the Qgroup label denotes an affiliation among publishers of different content items while the Qcat label denotes a subject matter relationship among content items other grouping labels may also be used.

In some embodiments content items such as content item may also include a context vector. The context vector may contain any data representative of the content or of some portion thereof . For instance a context vector can include a list of terms words or phrases appearing in the content item and each term may have an associated weight based on the term frequency i.e. number of occurrences of the term in the content item document frequency i.e. number of content items in the corpus that contain the term or the like. Examples of context vectors are described e.g. in above referenced application Ser. No. 10 903 283 and application Ser. No. 11 033 100.

According to one embodiment a client application represented as module executing on client system includes instructions for controlling client system and its components to communicate with server systems and and to process and display data content received therefrom. Client application may be transmitted and downloaded to client system from a software source such as a remote server system e.g. server systems server system or other remote server system or client application module may also be provided on any software storage medium floppy disk CD DVD etc. that is readable by client system as discussed above. For example in one aspect client application may be provided over Internet to client system in an HTML wrapper including various controls such as for example embedded JavaScript or Active X controls for manipulating data and rendering data in various objects frames and windows.

Client application module advantageously includes various software modules for processing data and media content. In one embodiment these modules include a specialized search module a user interface module and an application interface module . Specialized search module is configured for processing search requests also referred to herein as queries to be sent to search server and search result data received from search server .

User interface module is configured for rendering data and media content in text and data frames and active windows e.g. browser windows and dialog boxes. In some embodiments user interface module includes or communicates with a browser program which may be a default browser configured on client system or a different browser. Application interface module is configured to support interfacing and communicating between client application and various other applications executing on client such as e mail applications instant messaging IM applications browser applications document management applications and others.

User interface module advantageously provides user input interfaces allowing the user to enter queries for processing by search server system . For example where user interface module includes or communicates with a browser the user may be able to enter a URL or activate a control button to direct the browser to a Web search page or site from which the user can submit a query to search server system for processing. In addition or instead user interface module may include a search toolbar or other interface via which the user can enter and submit a query without first navigating to the search page. Queries entered using user interface module may be preprocessed by specialized search module prior to being sent to search server system e.g. to remove so called stop words the and etc. to correct spelling errors or the like.

In some embodiments client application may include various features for adding context data referred to herein as a context vector to the user s queries. For example specialized search module may be configured to generate context vectors based on content the user is currently viewing at the time a query is entered. As another example in some embodiments of the present invention Web pages displayed in the browser may include one or more context vectors that can be used to supplement user entered queries. User interface module may be configured to detect such context vectors in a page being displayed and use context vector data to supplement a query entered by the user.

According to one embodiment of the invention search server system is configured to provide search result data and media content to client system and content server systems to are configured to provide data and media content such as web pages to client system for example in response to links selected by the user in search result pages provided by search server system . In some variations search server system returns content as well as or instead of links and or other references to content. Search server system references various page indexes that are populated with e.g. pages links to pages data representing the content of indexed pages etc. Page indexes may be generated by various collection technologies such as an automatic web crawler in addition manual or semi automatic classification algorithms and interfaces may be provided for classifying and ranking web pages within a hierarchical category structure. Such technologies and algorithms may be of generally conventional design and a detailed description is omitted as not being critical to the present invention.

In one embodiment an entry in page index includes a search term a reference e.g. a URL or other encoded identifier to a page in which that term appears and a context identifier for the page. The context identifier may be used for grouping similar results for search terms that may have different meanings in different contexts. For example the search term jaguar may refer to the British automobile to an animal to a professional football team and so on. The context identifier for a page can be used to indicate which of these contexts is applicable. In one embodiment the context identifier includes a category for the page with the category being assigned from a predefined hierarchical taxonomy of content categories. A page reference may be associated with multiple context identifiers so the same page or a link thereto may be displayed in multiple contexts. In some embodiments context identifiers are automatically associated with page links by the system as users perform various searches the identifiers may also be modified and associated with links manually by a team of one or more index editors.

Page index may also store the grouping label s if any included in the page allowing the corpus to be searched by grouping label. As described below in some embodiments one or more indices that index the corpus by grouping label are also created Qcat index is an index of pages by Qcat label and Qgroup index is an index of pages by Qgroup label. In other embodiments page index can be searched by Qcat label and or Qgroup label and building a separate Qcat index and or Qgroup index is not required.

Search server system is configured to provide data responsive to various search requests received from a client system in particular from search module and or user interface module . For example search server system may include a query response module that is configured with search related algorithms for identifying and ranking Web pages relative to a given query e.g. based on a combination of logical relevance which may be measured by patterns of occurrence of search terms in the query context identifiers page sponsorship etc.

In some embodiments query response module is also configured to receive and make use of context vector data that may be provided in association with a query in order to further enhance the response to queries. Query response module may also enhance search result information with additional information e.g. links and or advertising copy obtained from a sponsored content database . Sponsored content database may be implemented as part of page index by the inclusion of additional fields in each entry to identify page references that are sponsored and keywords for triggering the display of sponsored content or it may be implemented in a separate database.

In some embodiments search server also includes a context processing module that is configured with various algorithms for processing received content to generate a context vector representative of the received content. In general a context vector may include any data that represents all or part of the content. For example one embodiment of a context vector for text content may include keywords such as terms e.g. words or phrases that appear in the content and each such term may have an associated frequency count or a weight based on term frequency the number of times the term occurs in the received content and or document frequency e.g. the number or fraction of documents in the corpus that contain that term and or other parameters reflecting the likelihood that a particular term is a reliable indicator of context. Other types of data may also be included e.g. URLs or other data identifying any links that may be included in the content the URL or other identifier of the page that contains the content category data associated with the content or with a page that contains the content and so on.

As noted above content item and other content items can include grouping labels. As used herein a grouping label includes any piece of data e.g. an alphanumeric string or numerical value that can be inserted into a document by a publisher and recognized by various servers as indicating that the document belongs to a group of related documents. In preferred embodiments the grouping label is included in an HTML tag or other control structure so that it is detectable by suitably configured computer systems but does not appear in the displayed page.

Grouping labels can be used to indicate various relationships that can exist between content items. For instance two documents addressing the same subject matter might be considered related as might two documents produced by the same publisher two documents produced by affiliated publishers and so on. In some embodiments multiple classes of grouping labels are supported allowing different types of relationships to be defined.

For purposes of the present description two classes of grouping labels referred to herein as Qcat and Qgroup labels are used. A Qcat label is a label indicative of the subject matter of the document. In some embodiments a hierarchical taxonomy of category names is defined and each node in the taxonomy is assigned a unique Qcat label. The publisher of a particular content item selects a suitable category name from the taxonomy and includes the corresponding Qcat label in the content item. All content items containing a particular Qcat label are presumed to be related to each other by subject matter.

A Qgroup label is a label that indicates a personal or professional affiliation between publishers of different documents. In some embodiments a publisher referred to herein as a founding publisher who wants to be affiliated with other publishers creates a unique Qgroup label. The founding publisher includes this Qgroup label in its own content items and invites other publishers to include the same Qgroup label in their items as well. All content items containing a particular Qgroup label are presumed to be affiliated with each other i.e. produced by publishers who have an affiliation with each other and therefore related to each other.

It is to be understood that the classes of grouping labels used herein are illustrative and not limiting. Other classes of grouping labels e.g. by author by type of content etc. could also be supported in addition to or instead of those used in the examples herein. Further it is to be understood that only one class of grouping labels might be used with different types of relationships not being distinguished.

To facilitate consistent use of grouping labels across publishers and content items each label namespace is advantageously subject to centralized management. In some embodiments a namespace manager is communicably connected to Internet . Namespace manager maintains a labels data store that stores a list of valid grouping label values for each recognized class of grouping labels. Namespace manager communicates via Internet with publishers of content distributed via content servers to allowing the publishers to select grouping labels for inclusion in their content items. In some embodiments namespace manager can create new grouping labels in response to publisher requests in other embodiments namespace manager provides grouping labels from a predefined list.

Further as described below namespace manager may also be configured to validate any grouping labels found in content items e.g. in response to requests from web crawler and or search server . For instance when web crawler detects a grouping label in a Web page the value of the detected grouping label may be checked against the list of valid values in labels data store . Invalid grouping label values are advantageously not recorded in page index Qgroup index or Qcat index .

In some embodiments system also includes an advertisement ad server coupled to Internet . Ad server has access to a sponsored content database that stores references to content items that can be displayed as advertisements e.g. banner ads or pop ups or the like while the user views a related content item. In some embodiments each entry in sponsored content database can have one or more group labels associated with it and ads to be displayed while the user views a given content item are selected using the grouping labels as described below.

It will be appreciated that the search system described herein is illustrative and that variations and modifications are possible. Any of the various systems including content server search server web crawler namespace manager and or ad server may be part of a single organization e.g. a distributed server system such as that provided to users by Yahoo Inc. or they may be part of disparate organizations. Each server system generally includes at least one server and an associated database system and may include multiple servers and associated database systems and although shown as a single block may be geographically distributed. For example all servers of a search server system may be located in close proximity to one another e.g. in a server farm located in a single building or campus or they may be distributed at locations remote from one another e.g. one or more servers located in city A and one or more servers located in city B . Thus as used herein a server system typically includes one or more logically and or physically connected servers distributed locally or across one or more geographic locations the terms server and server system are used interchangeably. Further servers described as separate may be implemented on the same computer system or on different computer systems.

The search server system may be configured with one or more page indexes and algorithms for accessing the page index es and providing search results to users in response to search queries received from client systems. The search server system might generate the page indexes itself receive page indexes from another source e.g. a separate server system or receive page indexes from another source and perform further processing thereof e.g. addition or updating of the context identifiers and or grouping labels .

In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention publishers can label their Web pages or other content items with grouping labels that are usable to associate pages with each other. As described above various classes of grouping labels can be used to represent different relationships e.g. Qcat labels for related subject matter and Qgroup labels for affiliated publishers. The grouping labels selected by the publisher are included in the content items and can be detected by web crawler search server and other systems thus information about which pages include which grouping labels can be used in a variety of ways for selecting information to present to a user. This section describes processes for selecting grouping label s to include in a content item. Examples of using grouping labels to select information for presentation to a user are described below.

In some embodiments of the present invention the available grouping labels include a Qgroup label that represents a personal or professional or affiliation among publishers. Using the Qgroup label publishers can identify their content items as being provided by mutually affiliated publishers.

Qgroup labels are advantageously managed by namespace manager . In one embodiment namespace manager creates a Qgroup label in response to a request from a first publisher referred to herein as a founding publisher. Once a Qgroup label is created other publishers may use that label at the invitation of the founding publisher. Any number of Qgroup labels may coexist and labels data store advantageously includes a list of Qgroup labels their founding publishers and other publishers who have been invited by the founding publisher. In some embodiments additional metadata about each Qgroup label may also be stored in labels data store .

At step the founding publisher shares the Qgroup label with one or more other publishers. In one embodiment the Qgroup label is a numerical value and the founding publisher may provide the Qgroup label directly to other publishers. These other publishers can join the group by including the Qgroup label in their own content items. In some embodiments publishers may be limited to one Qgroup label per content item in other embodiments a content item might include multiple different Qgroup labels.

In other embodiments Qgroup labels might be encoded to ensure that the use of the label by other publishers has been approved by the founding publisher. For instance each publisher might be given a different but related Qgroup label each of which is separately validated. In one such embodiment at step the founding publisher receives a first Qgroup label that has a base portion and a publisher specific portion. At step the founding publisher communicates with namespace manager to issue an invitation to another publisher to obtain a related Qgroup label for inclusion in its own pages. The invitation may be communicated to the other publisher by e mail or any other suitable channel. If the other publisher accepts namespace manager generates a second Qgroup label that has the same base portion as the first Qgroup label but a different publisher specific portion. For purposes of identifying related pages e.g. as described below Qgroup labels are considered the same if the base portions are the same. For purposes of validating a Qgroup label labels data store maintains a list of recognized publisher specific portions for each base Qgroup label and a Qgroup label is valid only if the combination of base portion and publisher specific portion is recognized. Other schemes for regulating which publishers can use a Qgroup label may also be used.

As described below after the Qgroup labels have been included in the Web pages or other content items published by affiliated publishers these labels can be detected and used to identify the pages having the same Qgroup label or at least the same base portion as being related to each other.

In some embodiments other publishers are allowed to join an existing group by adding the Qgroup label to their content items without an explicit invitation from the founding publisher. Where this is the case namespace manager advantageously provides metadata about existing groups that enables a publisher to make an informed selection. For instance when a new Qgroup label is created the founding publisher can supply a description of a theme for the group e.g. cat breeders wine enthusiasts etc. . The theme is stored as metadata and other publishers can search for Qgroup labels for their content based on theme. In some embodiments the founding publisher may select between an open any publisher can join or closed only publishers invited by the founding publisher can join policy for the label and namespace manager implements the selected policy.

In another embodiment namespace manager can infer metadata about a group. For instance a theme for the group can be inferred by analyzing the content of different pages having the same Qgroup label. For this purpose namespace manager might access Qgroup index to identify such pages.

It is not required that all of a publisher s content items include the same Qgroup label. For instance a publisher that publishes content in several unrelated areas might prefer to have different content items be affiliated with different groups of publishers.

In other embodiments of the present invention the available grouping labels include a Qcat label that represents a subject matter category of a content item. Using the Qcat label publishers can identify by category the subject matter of their content items. As described below Qcat labels can be detected and used to identify pages having the same Qcat label as being related to each other.

Qcat labels are advantageously managed by namespace manager . In one embodiment a team of human editors generates a taxonomy of category names. This taxonomy may be hierarchical in one embodiment the taxonomy is generally similar to the existing Yahoo directory. Where a taxonomy of context identifiers is used to categorize pages during web crawling operations as described above the same taxonomy may also be used for the category names. Namespace manager defines a Qcat label corresponding to each category name and stores the Qcat labels and associated category names in data store . Publishers can interact with namespace manager to view or browse the taxonomy of category names and select the one that best describes a particular content item. Namespace manager provides the Qcat label corresponding to the selected category name and the publisher includes the Qcat label in the content item.

At step a publisher communicates with namespace manager to view the taxonomy of category names. Communication may take place via HTTP requests from the publisher for a document containing all or part of the taxonomy. Namespace manager transmits the requested document e.g. as an HTML form the publisher can use to select a category. In some embodiments one document includes the entire taxonomy in other embodiments multiple interlinked documents are used. In some embodiments a search interface is provided via which the publisher can enter keywords and retrieve a list of categories corresponding to those keywords. The publisher browses the taxonomy and selects a category name. The selected name is transmitted to namespace manager .

At step namespace manager provides to the publisher the Qcat label corresponding to the selected category name. At step the publisher includes the Qcat label in the content item.

It will be appreciated that the process described herein is illustrative and that variations and modifications are possible. Steps described as sequential may be executed in parallel order of steps may be varied and steps may be modified or combined. In one alternative embodiment the publisher provides to namespace manager a content item to be categorized. Namespace manager executes a text processing algorithm to select one or more suggested categories for the content item e.g. based on an analysis of terms appearing in the content item. These suggestions are presented to the publisher who can select one or reject them all and select a different category e.g. by browsing the taxonomy starting from one of the suggested categories.

In some embodiments only one Qcat label per content item is supported. In other embodiments multiple Qcat labels might be supported. For instance if a Web page contains sections related to several different subjects as is often the case for news pages web logs blogs and the like it might be desirable to include a different Qcat label for each section.

As described below after the Qcat labels have been included in the Web pages or other content items by the publishers thereof these labels can be detected and used to identify the pages in which they appear as being related to each other.

Grouping labels are used to define relationships among content items. By way of illustration is a relationship diagram illustrating relationships among content items according to an embodiment of the present invention. In this example three publishers A B and C have created content items. Publisher A has created content items Item A Item A and Item A publisher B has created content items Item B and Item B and publisher C has created content items Item C Item C and Item C . It is to be understood that content items may be published via any combination of content servers to .

Each content item includes a Qcat label that was selected by the publisher of that item e.g. in accordance with process described above. Items with the same Qcat label are regarded as being related in the sense that such items pertain to similar subject matter. Thus as indicated by the solid lines connecting pairs of related items items and all having Qcat 3141 are related and items and both having Qcat 13759 are related.

Further each content item includes a Qgroup label selected by the publisher. In this example publisher A is the founding publisher for a Qgroup label Qgroup 4379 that has been shared to publisher B. Publisher A s items and publisher B s items have each been labeled with the same Qgroup label. Items with the same Qgroup label are regarded as being related in the sense that there is some affiliation between the publishers of those items. Thus as indicated by the broken lines connecting pairs of related items items are all related to each other. Publisher C is not affiliated with publishers A and B and items are not related by Qgroup to any of the other items shown. It is to be understood that the Qgroup label in publisher C s items might be shared with other publishers not explicitly represented in .

As shows use of grouping labels allow publishers to define relationships e.g. content based or affiliation based relationships among content items by voluntarily including grouping labels in their own content items. In the embodiments described herein publishers do not label other publishers content and might not know whether or how content items of other publishers have been labeled.

To the extent that the same grouping labels are included in different content items relationships among content items are established. The grouping label information is advantageously harvested and used to identify related content to present to users as will now be described.

In some embodiments the grouping labels are included as tokens e.g. HTML tags or other control structures in the content item. The tokens are advantageously formatted so as not to affect the display of the content item. In some embodiments however the tokens are detectable as grouping labels by web crawler as it processes Web pages. In some embodiments web crawler communicates with labels data store e.g. directly or via namespace manager to verify that any purported grouping labels detected in content items are valid i.e. within the set of grouping labels defined and managed by namespace manager .

At step web crawler detects a Qcat label in the page. In preferred embodiments a Qcat label may appear anywhere within a page and a page may contain multiple Qcat labels. Web crawler is advantageously configured to detect any number of Qcat labels per page regardless of where they appear. At step web crawler determines whether the Qcat label is valid e.g. by consulting labels data store . If the Qcat label is valid then at step the Qcat label is added to the page index entry for the current page. The Qcat label is advantageously in a separate field from other information in the entry. Where a page includes multiple Qcat labels each Qcat label is added to the page index entry.

At step web crawler determines whether more pages remain to be processed. If so the next page is selected at step e.g. using conventional techniques and process returns to step to process the next page.

After all pages have been processed at step web crawler builds Qcat index which lists pages containing each valid Qcat label e.g. by inverting page index . In some embodiments some valid Qcat labels might not be included in any pages and Qcat index is advantageously arranged such that the absence of pages corresponding to a particular label is correctly handled.

It will be appreciated that the process described herein is illustrative and that variations and modifications are possible. Steps described as sequential may be executed in parallel order of steps may be varied and steps may be modified or combined. In addition a similar process can be used to generate Qgroup index of or an index keyed to any other grouping label. In some embodiments multiple indices are generated in parallel as web crawler operates. Alternative techniques for collecting grouping label data are described below.

In some embodiments grouping labels are used in processing search queries submitted by users. For example in the embodiment of a client system may transmit a search query to search server . Query response module of search server accesses page index to generate a response to the query. The response generally includes a list of hits i.e. references to pages that include terms from the search query. The hits are ranked e.g. based on some measure of logical relevance to the query and the ranked list of hits is formatted into a search report that is transmitted to client system . In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention search server may enhance the generally conventional query processing techniques implemented in query response module by using grouping labels during the identification and or ranking of search hits. For example in some embodiments where Qcat labels are used search server matches the search query to a Qcat label then identifies category matching pages based on Qcat index . The category matched pages can be presented as a separate list of hits or information about which hits are also category matched pages can be used in ranking the hits found in a conventional search.

At step search server converts one or more of the query terms to a category name selected from the taxonomy of categories stored in labels database . Various algorithms known in the art including text string matching algorithms or the like may be used to match query terms to a category name. At step search server identifies a Qcat label that matches the category name e.g. by reference to labels data store . At step search server identifies category matching pages i.e. pages that include the matching Qcat label. Step may include consulting Qcat index or page index using the Qcat label as a key.

At step search server incorporates the category matching pages into the search report. Incorporation may take various forms. In one embodiment search server ranks the Qcat matching pages e.g. based on occurrence of the query terms therein and provides a separate listing of category results in addition to the conventional list of hits. In another embodiment search server determines whether any of the Qcat matching pages correspond to the hits and uses that information to rerank the pages e.g. by boosting the ranking of hits that are also Qcat matching pages. At step the search result is transmitted to the user.

It will be appreciated that process is illustrative and that variations and modifications are possible. Steps described as sequential may be executed in parallel order of steps may be varied and steps may be modified or combined. In some embodiments not all search queries can be matched to a category name e.g. due to ambiguity or limitations of the matching algorithm. Where a match is not possible steps and might be omitted. In some embodiments where the search query can be matched to multiple category names the user might be prompted to select the category that best represents the desired information.

In other embodiments an initial search report is presented to the user without category matching the search report page includes a section listing the category names of one or more possible matching categories selected as in step of process and suitable prompts inviting the user to explore one or more of these categories. When the user selects a category search server responds with a list of category matching pages generated e.g. in accordance with steps and of process .

In still other embodiments when the user submits a query to search server search server initially responds with a listing of hits that is generally conventional except that for each hit that includes a grouping label e.g. Qcat or Qgroup label the listing includes a control that the user can operate to view related content. When the user activates this control the related content can be selected based on the grouping labels included in the hit e.g. in accordance with steps and of process .

In some embodiments grouping labels are integrated with contextual search interfaces. A contextual search interface is associated with a specific Web page or portion of a Web page. The contextual search interface can appear as an icon in a Web page referred to herein as a hosting page in association with some or all of the page content. The user can activate the icon to view related content and or execute a search using a user supplied query together with a context vector representing the content. A detailed description of contextual search interfaces can be found in above referenced application Ser. No. 10 903 283 application Ser. No. 11 033 100 and application Ser. No. 11 033 417.

By way of illustration shows an example of a hosting page that includes content items as it might appear when displayed on client system of . A contextual search Related Results icon is placed near each content item . Each icon corresponds to a contextual search interface in an inactive state. The interface is brought to an active state when the user activates it e.g. by clicking on the icon using a conventional mouse or other pointing device.

Icons are advantageously generated using suitable code blocks in the source code for page . is an example of a code block for a contextual search interface with grouping labels according to an embodiment of the present invention. The code block includes among other things a hyperlink that invokes a script to activate the icon an activated icon is described below a context vector a Qgroup label and a Qcat label . Qgroup label and Qcat label are advantageously generated as described above and inserted into code block at the direction of the publisher of the page that includes code block . Also included is a customization sourceOrder tag that is set by the publisher to indicate which types of information should be included in the active contextual search interface. In this embodiment value s denotes suggested search queries value r denotes related content described below and value i denotes an interface for submitting user created contextual queries. These values are illustrative and other values could be substituted.

Referring again to a user who is interested in information related to a content item on page e.g. content item selects the corresponding contextual search icon e.g. by clicking on it using a conventional mouse. When contextual search icon is selected it is activated to provide a contextual search interface. Activation of icon advantageously includes sending an information request including at least part of contextual search interface code block to search server of . Search server responds by providing to client application various information items that can be displayed in a contextual search overlay.

A list of suggested search queries is presented in section and the user may execute one of these queries by clicking on it. Suggested search queries can be generated based on the context vector e.g. as described in above referenced application Ser. No. 10 903 283 application Ser. No. 11 033 100 and application Ser. No. 11 033 417.

Overlay also includes in section a listing of related sites. In one embodiment the listing in section is generated using the Qcat label and or Qgroup label from code block as well as the context vector . In this embodiment overlay displays only a small number of related sites in section and the user can operate More . . . button to view additional related results e.g. in a new window.

At step search server logs the received information request. The logged information can be used to build indexes of pages with contextual search interfaces as described below.

At step search server determines from the customization tag whether related content is to be displayed in the active contextual search interface. If so then at step search server reads the Qcat and or Qgroup labels from the information request. At step search server identifies one or more pages with a matching Qcat label or Qgroup label or both e.g. by consulting Qcat index and or Qgroup index .

At step search server ranks the matching pages. In one embodiment ranking includes comparing the content and or context vectors associated with the each matching page to the content and or context vector of the hosting page. Qgroup and or Qcat labels may also be used in ranking.

At step search server selects matching pages to be displayed. The contextual search interface displays e.g. the top three top five or some other number of matching pages and the highest ranking matching pages are advantageously selected for display. At step references to the matching pages are added to the contextual search interface e.g. by including suitably formatted references in a code block defining overlay . As noted above the overlay may also include a control allowing the user to view pages not selected at step and this control may also be implemented by including suitable code in the code block defining overlay .

At step other components of the active contextual search interface such as suggested queries listing and query submission box are generated e.g. as described in above referenced application Ser. No. 10 903 283 application Ser. No. 11 033 100 and application Ser. No. 11 033 417. At step the contextual search interface in the form of computer readable code for displaying the page is transmitted to client system and at step client system displays the active contextual search interface.

It will be appreciated that the contextual search interface and activation process described herein are illustrative and that variations and modifications are possible. Steps described as sequential may be executed in parallel order of steps may be varied and steps may be modified or combined. A contextual search interface may include any combination of elements and can appear in an overlay in line in the hosting page in a new window in a new browser tab or elsewhere as desired.

As noted above information requests generated from contextual search icons can be logged by search server . The request logs can be processed to gather information about contextual search interfaces and user behavior associated with such interfaces. For example an index of pages that have contextual search interfaces can be created. In addition where the logged information includes grouping labels an index keyed by grouping label e.g. Qgroup index or Qcat index can be built from the log. Also popularity scores for particular pages containing contextual search interfaces can be generated e.g. based on the number of times an information request is sent from a page containing such an interface. This popularity information can be used e.g. in ranking related pages selected by grouping label.

In another embodiment of the present invention Qgroup and or Qcat labels are used to select advertisements ads to be displayed when a particular Web page is displayed.

It is known in the art that an advertisement can be dynamically selected when a page is displayed for a user. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention the selection includes matching a Qgroup or Qcat label of the page being displayed to a Qgroup or Qcat label assigned to an advertisement by a sponsor thereof. The process may be generally similar to that shown in with the steps of finding and ranking matching ads being performed by an ad server and the top ranked ad being selected for display to the user. Ranking of the matching pages can be based in part on the terms of agreements between the provider of the ad server and the sponsors of various ads as is known in the art.

In another embodiment of the present invention grouping labels can be used to create a browsable directory of labeled pages. For example in embodiments where the Qcat label represents a category name selected by the publisher from a hierarchical taxonomy a browsable version of the taxonomy can be displayed for the user. When the user selects a category name from the taxonomy a listing of pages labeled with the corresponding Qcat label can be displayed.

At step search server accesses Qcat index to find pages referred to herein as hit pages or hits that have the Qcat label s identified at step . At step the hit pages are ranked. In one embodiment ranking is based on a relevance score determined by comparing a context vector or other representation of the content of the hit page to the category name e.g. using a conventional search algorithm with the category name substituted for the search query. In other embodiments ranking might be based at least in part on page sponsorship information and or explicit user feedback e.g. ratings about the page content or relevance of the page to the category. Such feedback may be collected as users browse the directory and added to the Qcat index. Conventional techniques for collecting user feedback and incorporating such feedback into page ranking may be used.

At step a listing of hit pages in rank order is provided to the user. In one embodiment the listing is presented in a manner analogous to a conventional search report with links to the top ten or twenty or some other number of hit pages presented in a first screen and navigation buttons for viewing links to additional pages. Each listing may include e.g. a page title abstract and other information e.g. user feedback and may be accompanied by prompts and control elements for soliciting and accepting user feedback as to whether the page is useful or relevant to the category.

The listing advantageously is presented together with a navigation panel that allows the user to further browse the taxonomy. The navigation panel may include a list of sub categories of the current category an option to move up in the hierarchy and so on.

While the invention has been described with respect to specific embodiments one skilled in the art will recognize that numerous modifications are possible. For instance the Qgroup and Qcat labels are illustrative. Any number of grouping labels may be supported and a grouping label may indicate any definable relationship.

In addition some embodiments may include user feedback features and or an editorial review process for evaluating the appropriateness of the grouping labels assigned to particular pages. Where a grouping label is used inappropriately e.g. where a Qcat label is included in a page whose content does not relate to the category the grouping index or other data store can be updated such the label is in effect ignored.

The embodiments described herein may make reference to Web sites pages links and other terminology specific to instances where the World Wide Web or a subset thereof serves as the search corpus. It should be understood that the systems and processes described herein can be adapted for use with a different search corpus such as an electronic database or document repository and that results may include content as well as links or references to locations where content may be found.

In addition the invention has been described with reference to computer systems having particular hardware and software elements. It is to be understood that other systems with different combinations of hardware and or software components could also be implemented.

Thus although the invention has been described with respect to specific embodiments it will be appreciated that the invention is intended to cover all modifications and equivalents within the scope of the following claims.
