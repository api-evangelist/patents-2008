title: Method for manufacturing lateral germanium detectors
abstract: An improved method for manufacturing a lateral germanium detector is disclosed. A detector window is opened through an oxide layer to expose a doped single crystalline silicon layer situated on a substrate. Next, a single crystal germanium layer is grown within the detector window, and an amorphous germanium layer is grown on the oxide layer. The amorphous germanium layer is then polished to leave only a small portion around the single crystal germanium layer. A dielectric layer is deposited on the amorphous germanium layer and the single crystal germanium layer. Using resist masks and ion implants, multiple doped regions are formed on the single crystal germanium layer. After opening several oxide windows on the dielectric layer, a refractory metal layer is deposited on the doped regions to form multiple germanide layers.

The present invention was made with United States Government assistance under Contract No. HR0011 05 C 0027 awarded by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA . The United States Government has certain rights in the present invention.

The present invention relates to optical detectors in general and in particular to a method for manufacturing lateral germanium detectors.

Photodetection in the near infrared IR regime has many applications such as telecommunications thermal imaging etc. InGaAs based PIN photodetectors are commonly used for telecommunication applications due to their high responsivity and speed. However the majority of the InGaAs based detectors are normal incidence detectors and the integration of such devices on silicon surfaces can be very expensive. Also integration of high speed InGaAs detectors requires special optics to focus light into a small active area which has been found to reduce device performance.

Germanium based detectors are known to be a suitable alternative. However germanium based detectors exhibit a higher dark current than InGaAs based detectors which limit their application in the telecommunications industry. In recent years attempts have been made to improve the performance of polycrystalline germanium based detectors for these applications. One exemplary prior art poly germanium detector is described by Colace et al. in an article entitled Applied Physics Letters vol. 76 p. 1231 et seq. 2000 .

The present disclosure provides an improved method for manufacturing lateral germanium based detectors.

In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention a detector window is opened through an oxide layer to expose a doped single crystalline silicon layer located on a substrate. Next a single crystal germanium layer is grown within the detector window and an amorphous germanium layer is grown on the oxide layer. The amorphous germanium layer is then polished to leave only a small portion around the single crystal germanium layer. A dielectric layer is deposited on the amorphous germanium layer and the single crystal germanium layer. Using resist masks and implants doped regions are formed on the single crystal germanium layer. After opening several oxide windows on the dielectric layer a refractory metal layer is deposited on the doped regions to form multiple germanide layers.

All features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent in the following detailed written description.

Referring now to the drawings and in particular to there are illustrated successive steps of a method for fabricating a lateral germanium based detector in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Initially a dry etch process is utilized to open a detector window through a nitride layer 250 and an oxide layer 6 000 to expose a single crystalline silicon layer situated on an insulator substrate as shown in .

A single crystal germanium layer is then grown within detector window as depicted in . Four different gases are used for the growth of single crystal germanium layer namely hydrogen 100 silane SiH 100 germane GeH and 100 diborane BH . The germanium growth process uses silicon and silicon germanium seed layers to create an abrupt transition from the underlying single crystal silicon surface and the single crystal germanium growth. The usage of the seed layers allows for a subsequent single crystal germanium growth even across very large exposed single crystal silicon regions. For the present embodiment the bottom portion of the germanium growth is in situ doped with boron at a concentration of approximately 1 Eatoms cm. The boron concentration is graded with the highest concentration at the bottom of single crystal germanium layer as a doped germanium layer .

Because of the usage of the silicon seed layer the germanium growth is not completely selective and some germanium can form over nitride layer as an amorphous germanium layer as depicted in . Amorphous germanium layer may serve as a sacrificial polish layer for subsequent processing.

Doped germanium layer minimizes the electric fields at the bottom of single crystal germanium layer which can decrease detector noise and dark currents caused by defects commonly located at the bottom of single crystal germanium layer . The boron in doped germanium layer can be replaced by other dopants.

Single crystal germanium layer and amorphous germanium layer are then polished via a chemical mechanical polish CMP as shown in . It is preferable to stop the CMP process before amorphous germanium layer is completely removed. This is because polishing too far can expose voids and crystalline defects that tend to form at the edge of detector window from and single crystal germanium layer and polishing too close to the crystalline defects can create voids by tearing out entire crystalline defects.

Using a mask the remaining portion of amorphous germanium layer is removed via a dry etch leaving a portion of amorphous germanium layer located around single crystal germanium layer as depicted in .

After a tetraethyl orthosilicate TEOS layer has been deposited on single crystal germanium layer and amorphous germanium layer multiple n implant regions are formed on single crystal germanium layer as shown in via an appropriate mask and ion implants.

TEOS layer may be replaced by other types of oxides or dielectrics including nitride. For example germanium oxy nitride can be used instead of TEOS in layer in order to lower the stress over amorphous germanium layer which should reduce noise and dark current. TEOS layer is utilized to seal the edge of a germanium detector at which defects and voids are most prone to be formed.

Next multiple p doped germanium regions are formed on single crystal germanium layer as depicted in via a mask. All n implant regions and p doped germanium regions can be activated via annealing. Preferably implant masks are utilized to keep the n and p dopants away from the defects and voids at the edge of single crystal germanium layer . Keeping the n and p dopants away from the defect prone edge regions can decrease detector noise and dark current.

TEOS or germanium oxy nitride layer is then patterned using a resist mask and a dry etch is utilized to open multiple oxide windows as shown in . Oxide windows expose n implant regions and p doped germanium regions for respective germanide formations later.

A titanium deposition is performed on n implant regions and p doped germanium regions that are exposed through oxide windows . One or more heat treatments are then utilized to form TiGe material within oxide windows as depicted in . Since no TiGe can be formed over TEOS layer non reacted Ti layer remains to be situated on top of TEOS layer as depicted in .

The remaining non reacted Ti layer located on top of TEOS layer may be removed using a resist mask and dry etch as depicted in . Alternatively the remaining non reacted Ti layer located on top of TEOS layer may be removed with a wet strip. Generally a wet strip is not the preferred choice because there is some risk that the wet strip may remove TiGe material or create pits in single crystal germanium layer . The processing options are not limited to titanium germanide as any refractory metal may be used to form the germanide.

At this point a P i N germanium detector having a lateral configuration is formed and conventional semiconductor processing techniques can be utilized to fabricate dielectrics and contacts at the top of the P i N germanium detector. The detector shown in may be used to detect light from above single crystal germanium layer and may be configured as a focal plane array. Alternatively the detector shown in may be configured to detect light from an underlying waveguide by using single crystalline silicon layer as the end of a waveguide. The detector shown in may also be configured as a butt coupled device where the light comes from a waveguide that is coupled from the side of single crystal germanium layer .

As has been described the present invention provides an improved method for manufacturing a lateral germanium detector.

While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
