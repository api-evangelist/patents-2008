The present invention relates to a corona charger and a process cartridge and an image forming apparatus using the corona charger.

In a typical electrophotographic image forming apparatus first a surface of a photoreceptor is evenly charged and the charged surface is then exposed to a light beam modulated by image information to form an electrostatic latent image thereon. A toner is supplied to the electrostatic latent image to form a toner image on the surface of the photoreceptor. The toner image is transferred onto a recording medium directly or via an intermediate transfer member and then fixed thereon upon application of heat and pressure. Residual toner particles remaining on the surface of the photoreceptor are removed by a cleaning blade.

Corona discharge is a continuous discharge phenomenon that occurs upon local dielectric breakdown of air in an uneven electric field. A typical corona charger has a configuration in which a corona wire with a micro diameter is stretched taut in a shield case made of aluminum a part of which is eliminated. Corona ions are discharged from the part of the sealed case which is eliminated. As the voltage applied to the corona wire increases a strong electric field is locally formed at the periphery of the corona wire causing local dielectric breakdown of air and thus continuous discharge of electricity.

The type of corona discharge largely depends on the polarity of the voltage applied to the corona wire. A positive corona discharge causes an even electric discharge on the surface of the corona wire whereas a negative corona discharge causes a local streamer discharge. Accordingly the positive corona discharge has an advantage over the negative corona discharge in evenness of electric discharge. In addition the negative corona discharge produces several tens of times the amount of ozone produced by the positive corona discharge thereby increasing environmental load.

Although having a more complicated configuration and providing a lower charging efficiency than the corotron corona charger the scorotron corona charger is widely used because of having an advantage in evenness of charging. The control electrode is usually known and described as charging grid in electrophotographic image forming apparatuses and therefore the control electrode may be hereinafter referred to as charging grid .

However the corona charger has the following problems 1 to 3 which are caused by discharge products such as nitrogen oxides NOx .

It is known that a negative corona charger typically produces discharge products because substances in the air are reacted upon a negative corona discharge. Specific examples of the discharge products include ozone O and nitrogen oxides NOx such as nitrogen monoxide NO and nitrogen dioxide NO that are produced by oxidation of nitrogen with ozone. In general ozone adversely affects the human respiratory system and humans can generally sense a foul odor of ozone when it is in concentrations of 0.1 ppm or more. Specifically nitrogen dioxide NO is the worst at adversely affecting the human respiratory system. A permissible level of nitrogen dioxide NO is 0.04 to 0.06 ppm or less per hour on daily average based on environmental standards. Further nitrogen oxides may be altered into photochemical oxidants Ox by a photochemical reaction caused by ultraviolet rays a permissible level of which is 0.06 ppm or less based on environmental standards. Generally several tens of ppm of ozone and several ppm of nitrogen oxides are produced in the corona discharge. Consequently contemporary image forming apparatuses are provided with a filter made of activated carbon or the like so that fewer discharge products are emitted from the image forming apparatus.

During a long term discharge discharge products are accumulated on inner walls of a corona charger. When the corona charger is left at rest after the long term discharge the discharge products gradually contaminate a charging target i.e. a photoreceptor resulting in a difference in surface potential between a surface area of the photoreceptor disposed immediately below the corona charger and the other areas thereof. As a consequence the resultant image density is uneven. The above described phenomenon that causes unevenness in the resultant image density prominently occurs in a low humidity condition of about 20 RH and rarely occurs at normal temperature and humidity.

Specifically the surface of the photoreceptor is reversibly reacted with the discharge products thereby increasing the capacitance or decreasing the resistance of the photoreceptor. As a result a difference in surface potential is generated. Most photoreceptors cause this phenomenon. In particular a photoreceptor having a cross linked surface layer as a protective layer prominently causes the phenomenon.

As long as a photoreceptor is charged by electric discharge in an electrophotographic image forming apparatus image blurring is caused to a greater or lesser extent resulting in deterioration of resolution of the resultant image referred to here as image blurring.

Image blurring is caused by adhesion of paper powder to a photoreceptor and by use environment and is mainly caused by discharge products. Image blurring cannot be completely prevented unless a photoreceptor is charged by a charging method which does not produce ozone and NOx which is not yet invented. Image blurring can be suppressed to some extent by heating a photoreceptor however problems of shortening of the life of the photoreceptor waste of electric power upsizing of apparatus and so forth may arise. Alternatively image blurring can be suppressed to some extent by abrading a surface of a photoreceptor so that discharge products adhered to the surface can be removed. However contemporary photoreceptors have developed to have a durable surface that is hard to abrade resulting in insufficient removal of discharge products.

Discharge products adhere to a photoreceptor sparsely at first but gradually spread thereover. As a consequence a hygroscopic low resistance layer is formed thereon. As described above image blurring is a phenomenon in which an image in particular edges thereof is blurred because an electrostatic latent image is not normally formed. This phenomenon generally occurs when charges diffuse at a surface of the photoreceptor or the periphery thereof. In a case in which a hygroscopic low resistance layer is formed on or inside the photoreceptor charges are diffused resulting in destabilization of the electrostatic latent image. is a graph showing the surface potential of a photoreceptor when image blurring occurs.

When a surface of a photoreceptor is negatively charged and subsequently exposed to a light beam containing image information a pair of a hole and an electron is formed in a charge generation layer. The electron then migrates to a conductive substrate while the hole migrates toward negative charges present on an outermost layer. If the hole meets a low resistance layer on the way to the outermost layer the hole may leak laterally without reaching the outermost layer. If the outermost layer itself has a low resistance the hole may leak laterally on the outermost layer. In these cases a normal electrostatic latent image cannot be formed because charges i.e. holes in these cases are diffused or dissipated.

The lowness of the resistance of the low resistance layer is preferably as small as possible for the purpose of suppressing diffusion of charges that is deterioration of resolution of the resultant image. When the resistance of the low resistance layer is very low in particular when the volume resistivity is 10 cm or less the resolution of the resultant image deteriorates causing image blurring. Finally a normal image cannot be produced. At that time the surface potential of the photoreceptor has a dull pattern not a square wave pattern as illustrated in . More specifically a surface potential of a non image portion is reduced and that of an image portion is increased showing a low contrast there between. Such an undesirable phenomenon is further aggravated by time and humidity. In order to produce high resolution images a photoreceptor is required to have a volume resistivity of 10 cm or more and a surface resistivity of 10 cm or more.

An image forming apparatus using the scorotron corona charger sometimes produces an uneven image with raindrop like marks as illustrated in . Thin lines in a halftone image illustrated in are raindrop like marks. This phenomenon occurs when the charge amount is uneven within a small area of a surface of a photoreceptor. Specifically when high resistance substances such as toner silica that is an external additive of the toner or discharge products are adhered to a charging wire electric discharge does not occur reliably causing the above described phenomenon. When the high resistance substances described above are adhered to a charging grid discharged charges cannot flow into the charging grid and flow into the photoreceptor instead causing the above described phenomenon. Alternatively the charging grid itself is charged because the capacitance thereof is increased thereby excessively charging the photoreceptor locally.

As described above in order to reduce the emission amount of discharge products from an image forming apparatus a filter may be provided on an emission path. A charging target disposed immediately below the corona charger is generally contaminated with discharge products while the corona charger and the charging target are generally disposed facing with each other forming a gap of 1 to 2 mm there between so that the charging target is reliably charged. In order to prevent contamination of the charging target with discharge products a complicated mechanism is required such that a shield is disposed between the corona charger and the charging target or the corona charger or the charging target is withdrawn after the electric discharge.

To overcome the disadvantages of such a complicated configuration one proposed approach involves retaining a zeolite on the charging grid for the purpose of preventing contamination of the charging target with discharge products without such a mechanism. Specifically the zeolite retained on the charging grid adsorbs discharge products to prevent contamination of a charging target therewith. The charging grid typically retains the zeolite using a binder resin.

However the zeolite retained on the charging grid may be released therefrom with time resulting in insufficient removal of discharge products. This is because the discharge products that is reactive gases such as ozone and nitrogen oxides may degrade the binder resin with time.

In attempting to solve such problems Unexamined Japanese Patent Application Publication No. herein after JP A 2005 227470 discloses a corona charger the charging grid of which is made of SUS and coated with a conductive coating composition including an organic binder resin and fine particles of graphite nickel and an aluminum compound. It is disclosed therein that such a configuration prevents corrosion of the charging grid because the conductive coating layer adsorbs discharge products. Accordingly a charging target is prevented from being contaminated with discharge products. However since the fine particles in the conductive coating layer adsorb discharge products the capacity for adsorbing discharge products depends on the number of adsorbing sites in the fine particles and there is a possibility that the adsorbing sites become buried with long term use.

Unexamined Japanese Utility Model Application Publication No. 62 089660 discloses a corona charger in which finely partitioned communicating holes are arranged within an opening and an ozone adsorbing layer containing an ozone adsorbing material is further formed on the inner surface of the communication holes. A zeolite and an activated carbon are used as the ozone adsorbing material. It is disclosed therein that such a configuration prevents diffusion of ozone. However it is difficult to prevent ozone from diffusing toward a charging target side possibly contaminating a charging target with ozone.

JP 2003 43894 A discloses an image forming apparatus including a corona charger and a means for removing adsorbing discharge products adhered to a charging target and at least one of a means for preventing adhesion of discharge products to the charging target a means for preventing lowering of the resistance of the discharge products adhered to the charging target and a means for reducing the amount of discharge products produced at the periphery of the charging target. Accordingly multiple members are needed which is a disadvantage. An embodiment is also disclosed therein in which an adsorbent such as a zeolite is provided between the charging target and the corona charger. However such an embodiment cannot reliably charge the charging target.

In attempting to effectively reduce the amount of discharge products generated at the periphery of a charger JP 2001 075338 A discloses an image forming apparatus containing a photocatalyst i.e. a semiconductor such as titanium oxide on a surface that faces a discharge wire. The photocatalyst effectively decomposes discharge products so as to reduce the amount thereof. However the decomposition ability of the photocatalyst may not last for an extended period of time.

JP 2002 278223 A discloses an image forming apparatus including a charging member mainly composed of a catalytic and conductive material such as activated carbon fiber for the purpose of preventing deterioration of image quality under high humidity conditions improving durability of a photoreceptor and preventing generation of discharge products such as ozone and nitrogen oxide. However an ability of the activated carbon fiber to adsorb discharge products may deteriorate with long term use. Further an optional coating layer may not be consistently formed on such an activated carbon fiber because adhesion properties there between may deteriorate with long term use.

JP 2003 091143 A discloses an image forming apparatus in which a corona charger is disposed below a photoreceptor. An adsorptive and catalytic member is provided on a back side of the corona charger so as to adsorb discharge products. However the discharge products may also diffuse to a photoreceptor side which is opposite the back side of the corona charger resulting in incomplete adsorption of the discharge products.

Accordingly an object of the present invention is to provide a corona charger that produces fewer discharge products so as not to contaminate either the environment or a charging target.

An other object of the present invention is to provide a process cartridge and an image forming apparatus that reliably produces high quality images.

To achieve such objects the present invention contemplates the provision of a corona charger comprising 

wherein a layer comprising a zeolite a conductive agent and a binder resin is formed on a surface of the control electrode and a process cartridge and an image forming apparatus using the above corona charger.

These and other objects features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon consideration of the following description of the preferred embodiments of the present invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The latent image formed on the photoreceptor is then developed with a developer in a developing device to form a toner image. The toner image thus formed on the photoreceptor is then transferred onto a recording sheet upon application of a voltage to a transfer device . The applied voltage is controlled so that a constant current flows in the photoreceptor . On the other hand residual toner particles that remain on the photoreceptor without being transferred onto the recording sheet during development of the latent image into a toner image are removed by a cleaning device . The cleaning device includes a cleaning brush and a cleaning blade made of an elastic rubber. Subsequently residual latent images that remain on the photoreceptor are removed by a decharging device so that the photoreceptor is prepared for a next image forming operation. Thus a series of image forming processes is finished.

The above described image forming members may be directly mounted on an image forming apparatus such as a copier a facsimile and a printer. Alternatively they may be integrally supported as a process cartridge detachably attachable to an image forming apparatus.

For example such a process cartridge may include a photoreceptor and at least one member selected from a charger a developing device a transfer device a cleaning device and a decharging device.

The charge generation layer thus prepared preferably has a thickness of from 0.01 to 5 m and more preferably from 0.05 to 2 m.

The charge transport layer has a function of transporting charge.

The content of the charge transport material is preferably from 20 to 300 parts by weight and more preferably from 40 to 150 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the binder resin. The charge transport polymer can se used alone or in combination with the binder resin.

Specific examples of suitable solvents for preparing a coating liquid of the charge transport layer include the above described solvents suitable for that of the charge generation layer . Specifically solvents capable of sufficiently dissolving the charge transport material and the binder resin are preferable. These solvents can be used alone or in combination. The charge transport layer can be formed by the same method as the charge generation layer .

The charge transport layer preferably has a thickness of from 5 to 40 m and more preferably from 10 to 30 m.

The protective layer is provided for the purpose of improving a resistance to abrasion and scratching. Fine particles of conductive materials and or lubricative materials such as fluorine containing resins and acrylic resins may be dispersed in the protective layer for example. Alternatively a layer of a cross linked resin having a good mechanical strength may be formed as the protective layer . Specific examples of suitable cross linked resins include but are not limited to phenol resins urethane resins melamine resins hardened acrylic resins and siloxane resins. Further the protective layer preferably includes a charge transport material to improve electric properties thereof. Specific examples of suitable charge transport materials for the protective layer include the above described charge transport materials suitable for the charge transport layer .

The charging grid of the corona charger is typically made of a metal that is conductive to serve as a control electrode. Specific examples of suitable metals include but are not limited to aluminum nickel iron nichrome copper zinc and silver. Since the corona charger is exposed to discharge products such as ozone and nitrogen oxides metals having high corrosion resistance are preferable such as stainless steel including chrome and nickel.

In addition the charging grid has a function of transporting charges produced by the corona discharge to a photoreceptor and serves as a control electrode. Therefore the charging grid is preferably composed of a thin metal plate on which a grid is formed by punching or etching or as a plurality of metal wires arranged at even intervals.

In the present embodiment the charging grid is made of a plate of SUS304 having a thickness of 0.1 mm a length of 285 mm and a width of 40 mm. A grid pattern each section having sides of 0.1 mm are formed at an angle of 45 and intervals of 0.5 mm is formed within an opening having a length of 250 mm and a width of 36 mm.

In the present embodiment zeolite is used for removing discharge products. Zeolite is a crystal mainly composed of aluminum and silicon. A crystal of zeolite is too small to visually check the shape and size thereof but which when magnified reveals a lot of fine pores. More than 40 kinds of zeolite have been found in the natural world.

Zeolite has an adsorption ability and a decomposition ability. In order to further improve such properties synthetic zeolites have been commercially manufactured. Although having high characteristics a disadvantage of such synthetic zeolites is their high manufacturing cost.

For the above described reason zeolites manufactured using recycled materials such as coal ash have received attention recently as being both useful and environmentally sound. In addition such zeolites have an advantage of low manufacturing cost.

As described above zeolite has an ability to adsorb various substances. The mechanism of adsorption is similar to that of a deodorant or a desiccant. Accordingly zeolite is capable of adsorbing hazardous substances and removing foul odors.

In addition zeolite has an excellent cation exchanging capabilities that are two to three times those of natural zeolite. Accordingly zeolite is capable of ameliorating soil degradation by neutralizing acid and removing ammonium ion from sewage or drainage.

Further zeolite functions as a catalyst. Accordingly various attempts have been made to use zeolite for the purpose of decomposing nitrogen oxides NOx .

The kind of molecule which can be adsorbed in the pores of a zeolite is determined by the size of the pores and the size of the pores varies depending on the crystal form and the kind of cationic species of the zeolite. Therefore the crystal form and the kind of cationic species are preferably optimized according to a target material.

Zeolite generally has a crystal form of A form X form Y form L form mordenite form ferrierite form ZSM 5 form or beta form and generally includes a cationic species such as potassium sodium calcium ammonium and hydrogen. In addition the absorption ability and the function of a catalyst also vary depending on the content ratio between aluminum and silicon in the zeolite.

Among various kinds of zeolites those having a crystal form of A form X form or Y form and including a cationic species selected from potassium sodium and calcium are preferable. Such a zeolite sufficiently removes discharge products even after long term discharge.

A zeolite is retained on the charging grid using a binder resin. In other words a layer including a binder resin and a zeolite is formed on the charging grid. Both natural and synthetic resins can be used as the binder resin. Specific examples of suitable synthetic resins include but are not limited to thermoplastic and thermosetting resins such as polystyrene styrene acrylonitrile copolymer styrene butadiene copolymer styrene maleic anhydride copolymer polyester polyvinyl chloride vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer polyvinyl acetate polyvinylidene chloride polyarylate resin phenoxy resin polycarbonate cellulose acetate resin ethyl cellulose resin polyvinyl butyral polyvinyl formal polyvinyl toluene poly N vinylcarbazole acrylic resin silicone resin epoxy resin melamine resin urethane resin phenol resin and alkyd resin. These resins can be used alone or in combination.

The binder resin is required to be resistant to electric discharge and to be intimately adhered to the charging grid. Accordingly the amount of a thermosetting resin having a network structure which is formed by a polymerization upon application of heat is preferably as small as possible.

Moreover the binder resin is required not to excessively cover the zeolite to the point of suppressing the ability of zeolite to remove discharge products. Therefore the layer generally includes the binder resin in an amount of about 10 to 30 by weight. Within such a range not only can the zeolite sufficiently remove discharge products but the layer can also be intimately adhered to the charging grid.

In addition to the above described resins a hardened resin composition including an alkyd resin and an amino resin is preferable for the binder resin because such a resin composition is capable of finely dispersing zeolite and intimately adhering to the charging grid providing a reliable layer on the charging grid over a long term.

Usable alkyd resins include oil modified alkyd resins oil free alkyd resins and epoxy modified alky resins. Specific examples of commercially available oil modified alkyd resins include but are not limited to ETERKYD 3803 X 65 from Eternal Chemical Co. Ltd. BECKOSOL EZ 3801 60 from DIC Corporation and PHATALKYD 804 701A from Hitachi Chemical Co. Ltd. . Specific examples of commercially available oil free alkyd resins include but are not limited to BECKOLITE 46 118 and BECKOLITE M 6401 50 from DIC Corporation ALMATEX P645 from Mitsui Chemicals Inc. and ETERKYD 5062 X 70 1 from Eternal Chemical Co. Ltd. . Specific examples of commercially available epoxy modified alkyd resins include but are not limited to BECKOSOL P 790 50 from DIC Corporation EPOKEY 701HV and ETERKYD NP1022 R 50 from Eternal Chemical Co. Ltd. .

Among these resins oil free alkyd resins are preferable because of their excellent adhesion properties.

The amino resin serves as a cross linking agent for the alkyd resin. A melamine resin a guanamine resin and a combination of a melamine resin and a guanamine resin are preferably used as the amino resin. Specific examples of commercially available melamine resins include but are not limited to SAIMEL 303 from Mitsui CYTEC Ltd. SUPER BECKAMINE L 105 60 and SUPER BECKAMINE G 821 60 from DIC Corporation and ETERMINO 9216 60 from Eternal Chemical Co. Ltd. . Specific examples of commercially available guanamine resins include but are not limited to DELAMINE T 100 S and DELAMINE CTU 100 Fuji Kasei Kogyo Co. Ltd. SUPER BECKAMINE TD 126 from DIC Corporation and ETERMINO 9411 75 from Eternal Chemical Co. Ltd. .

Further polyamide resins are also preferable for the binder resin because the polyamide resins are capable of finely dispersing zeolite and intimately adhering to the charging grid providing a reliable layer on the charging grid over a long term.

In particular alcohol soluble polyamide resins are preferable such as modified polyamide resins copolymerized polyamide resins and copolymerized modified polyamide resins.

As the modified polyamide resin a modified nylon 6 in which hydrogen atoms are substituted with dimethyl amino groups can be used. Alternatively a modified nylon 6 in which hydrogen atoms of amide groups are substituted with methoxymethyl groups can also be used. Specific examples of commercially available modified polyamide resins include but are not limited to FR 101 FR 104 and FR 105 from Namariichi Co. Ltd. and F30K MF 30 and EF 30T from Nagase ChemteX Corporation .

Specific examples of usable copolymerized polyamide resins include but are not limited to trinary or quaternary copolymers such as nylon 6 66 610 nylon 6 66 12 nylon 6 69 12 nylon 6 612 12 nylon 6 66 69 12 nylon 6 66 11 12 nylon 6 66 610 12 nylon 6 66 612 12 and nylon 6 66 bis 4 aminocyclohexyl methane 6. Specific examples of commercially available copolymerized polyamide resins include but are not limited to CM 4000 CM 4001 and CM 8000 from Toray Industries Inc. .

Specific examples of commercially available copolymerized modified polyamide resins include but are not limited to FR 301 from Namariichi Co. Ltd. .

Among these resins copolymerized polyamide resins are preferable because of having excellent adhesion properties. In addition zeolites can be finely dispersed therein.

When an acid catalyst is added to the modified polyamide resin or the copolymerized modified polyamide resin intermolecular cross linking is accelerated therein providing better adhesion. As the acid catalyst both organic and inorganic acids can be used.

Specific examples of suitable organic acids include but are not limited to aliphatic monocarboxylic acids such as formic acid acetic acid propionic acid butyric acid isobutyric acid pentanoic acid pivalic acid lauric acid myristic acid stearic acid acrylic acid propiolic acid methacrylic acid crotonic acid and oleic acid aliphatic dicarboxylic acids such as oxalic acid malonic acid succinic acid glutaric acid adipic acid maleic acid and fumaric acid aromatic carboxylic acids such as benzoic acid phthalic acid isophthalic acid terephthalic acid toluic acid naphthoic acid and cinnamic acid heterocyclic carboxylic acids such as 2 furoic acid nicotinic acid isonicotinic acid aliphatic oxycarboxylic acids such as glycolic acid lactic acid hydracrylic acid oxybutyric acid glyceric acid tartronic acid malic acid tartaric acid and citric acid aromatic oxycarboxylic acid such as salicylic acid m oxybenzoic acid p oxybenzoic acid gallic acid mandelic acid and tropic acid aliphatic aminocarboxylic acids such as glycine alanine valine leucine isoleucine serine threonine cysteine cystine methionine aspartic acid glutamic acid lysine and arginine aminocarboxylic acids having an aromatic ring such as phenylalanine and tyrosine and amino acids having a heterocyclic ring such as histidine tryptophan proline and oxyproline.

Specific examples of suitable inorganic acids include but are not limited to sulfuric acid hydrochloric acid nitric acid phosphoric acid boric acid carbonic acid sulfurous acid nitrous acid phosphorous acid boronic acid hydrogen peroxide perchloric acid and nitrogen peroxide.

The layer formed on the charging grid further includes a conductive agent to control the resistance of the charging grid. If the layer includes no conductive agent the layer may have a very high volume resistance because neither the zeolite nor the binder resin is conductive. In this case the charging grid cannot function as a control electrode providing a similar performance to that of the related art corotron charger. As a consequence abnormal images with raindrop like marks may be produced. When the layer has a volume resistance of 1.0 10 or less abnormal images with raindrop like marks are not produced. In order to reliably produce higher quality images the layer preferably has a volume resistance of 1.0 10 or less and more preferably 1.0 10 or less.

The conductive agent is dispersed in the binder resin. Specific examples of suitable conductive agents include but are not limited to fine particles of metals such as graphite nickel copper and silver metal oxides such as antimony doped tin oxide ATO indium tin oxide ITO tin oxide and zinc antimonate and activated carbon. Since the charging grid is continuously exposed to electric discharge the conductive agent is required to be resistant to the electric discharge. Among the above described materials metals such as graphite and nickel and non doped metal oxides such as tin oxide and zinc antimonate are preferable because these materials provide reliable resistance even with long term use regardless of environmental variations.

In order not to suppress the other functions of the layer such as intimate adhesion to the charging grid and sufficient removal of discharge products the layer preferably includes the conductive agent in an amount as small as possible. Accordingly each of the fine particles of the conductive agent preferably has a conductivity as high as possible and a particle diameter as small as possible. In the present embodiment conductive fine particles having a particle diameter of from 0.01 to 15 mm are used. Binder resins having conductivity can be also used as the conductive agent. Two or more kinds of conductive agents can be used in combination.

First 5 to 10 by weight of a binder resin is dissolved in a solvent and then a zeolite and a conductive agent are added thereto while the solvent is agitated. Thus a coating liquid is prepared. The coating liquid preferably includes solid components in an amount of 30 by weight or less in a case used for spray coating.

The coating liquid can be applied to the charging grid by dipping spray coating roller coating electrophoretic deposition and the like method. From the viewpoint of even application spray coating is most preferable.

The charging grid is stretched taut from both ends in a direction of the long axis thereof and then set to a cylindrical base having a diameter of 30 mm so that the direction of the long axis is equal to that of the cylindrical axis. The cylindrical axis is horizontally disposed and the cylinder is rotated at a rotation speed of 170 rpm in a circumferential direction. The coating liquid is sprayed onto the charging grid by horizontally scanning the spray at a scanning speed of 10 mm sec while the charging grid is rotated. In order to apply the coating liquid on both sides of the charging grid the charging grid is set to the cylindrical base forming a gap of 3 mm there between. The charging grid one side of which is coated by the coating liquid is allowed to settle for 10 minutes. After replenishing the coating liquid the other side of the charging grid is also coated by the coating liquid. The charging gird both sides of which are thus coated is dried in a drier for 30 minutes at 130 C. so that layers are formed and fixed on both sides of the charging grid. The resultant layers have a thickness of 30 m.

As described above the conductive agent may be previously added to the coating liquid. Alternatively the conductive agent may be applied to or buried in a layer composed of the binder resin and the zeolite only.

The compositions of the coating layer of the charging grid in Examples 1 to 29 and Comparative Examples 1 to 7 are shown in Table 1.

The evaluation results of Examples 1 to 29 and Comparative Examples 1 to 7 are shown in Tables 2 1 2 2 and 2 3.

It is apparent from Table 2 1 that the coating layer has a high strength when the binder resin is a thermosetting resin. Specifically when the binder resin is an alkyd melamine resin the coating layer can keep a high strength even after a long term use. In particular when the content of the binder resin is from 10 to 60 by weight the coating layer is more intimately adhered to the charging grid the photoreceptor is more reliably charged and discharge products are more sufficiently removed.

It is apparent from Table 2 2 that the surface potential of the photoreceptor excesses the voltage applied to the charging grid and the resultant image is uneven when the coating layer includes no conductive agent. In other words the photoreceptor is not reliably charged when the coating layer includes no conductive agent. By contrast when the coating layer includes a conductive agent the surface potential of the photoreceptor is similar to that in a case the coating layer is not formed on the charging grid. In other words the photoreceptor is reliably charged when the coating layer includes a conductive agent. In particular when the content of the conductive agent is from 20 to 50 by weight the photoreceptor is more reliably charged the coating layer is more intimately adhered to the charging grid and discharge products are more sufficiently removed.

It is apparent from Table 2 3 that corona chargers including a charging grid having a coating layer including a zeolite are capable of suppressing production of NOx effectively removing discharge products and suppressing the occurrence of image density unevenness and image blurring. It is more effective to use such a corona charger in combination with a photoreceptor having an outermost protective layer. In particular when the content of the zeolite is from 20 to 70 by weight discharge products are more effectively removed. When the coating layer includes no zeolite discharge products cannot be removed.

The evaluation results of Examples 30 to 36 and Comparative Examples 8 to 11 are shown in Tables 4 1 4 2 and 4 3.

It is apparent from Table 4 1 that the coating layer of Comparative Example 10 that includes no binder resin does not reliably adhere to the charging grid and peels off by electric discharge. By contrast when the coating layer includes a binder resin to reliably hold a zeolite and a conductive agent the coating layer reliably adhere to the charging grid for an extended period of time.

It is apparent from Table 4 2 that the coating layer of Comparative Example 11 that includes no conductive agent produces abnormal images from an early stage. In addition the surface potential of the photoreceptor excesses the voltage applied to the charging grid.

It is apparent from Table 4 3 that discharge products are effectively removed when the coating layer includes a zeolite. In particular when the crystal form of the zeolite is A form X form or Y form discharge products are effectively removed even after 200 hour electric discharge.

The evaluation results of Examples 37 to 39 and Comparative Examples 12 to 13 are shown in Tables 6 1 6 2 and 6 3.

It is apparent from Table 6 1 that the coating layer of Comparative Example 12 that includes no binder resin does not reliably adhere to the charging grid and peels off by electric discharge. By contrast when the coating layer includes a binder resin to reliably hold a zeolite and a conductive agent the coating layer reliably adhere to the charging grid for an extended period of time.

It is apparent from Table 6 2 that the coating layer of Comparative Example 13 that includes no conductive agent produces abnormal images from an early stage. In addition the surface potential of the photoreceptor excesses the voltage applied to the charging grid.

It is apparent from Table 6 3 that discharge products are effectively removed when the coating layer includes a zeolite. In particular when the cationic species of the zeolite is potassium calcium sodium or hydrogen discharge products are effectively removed even after 200 hour electric discharge. It means that these cationic species are effectively replaced with discharge products.

Thus in order from an innermost side thereof an undercoat layer having a thickness of 3.5 m a charge generation layer having a thickness of 0.2 m and a charge transport layer having a thickness of 22 m were formed.

Further a cross linked charge transport layer coating liquid including 10 parts of a radical polymerizable trifunctional monomer having no charge transport structure trimethylolpropane triacrylate having a molecular weight of 296 and 3 functional groups KAYARAD TMPTA from Nippon Kayaku Co.

Thus a photoreceptor 4 including in order from an innermost side thereof an undercoat layer having a thickness of 3.5 m a charge generation layer having a thickness of 0.2 m a charge transport layer having a thickness of 22 m and a cross linked charge transport layer having a thickness of 5.2 m was prepared.

The procedure for preparation of the coating layer on the charging grid in Example 1 was repeated except that the composition of the coating liquid was change to those shown in Table 7.

The resultant corona charger was subjected to the following evaluations 4 to 6 using the photoreceptor 4 .

The volume resistance of the coating layer was measured using an instrument HIRESTA MODEL HT 201 from Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation . A voltage of 100 V was applied to the coating layer from two pronged high voltage application terminals. More specifically each of the terminals was brought into contact with a portion of the charging grid on which the coating layer was formed and that the coating layer was not formed. The center of the two terminals corresponded to a boundary between the portion of the charging grid on which the coating layer was formed and that on which the coating layer was not formed. A volume resistance was measured 10 seconds after the measurement was started. The measurement was repeated for 3 times and the measured values were averaged.

The charging grid was mounted on an image forming apparatus IMAGIO NEO 1350PRO from Ricoh Co. Ltd. at 10 C. and 15 RH. A voltage was applied to the charging grid so that a constant current flowed in the charging wire resulting in the occurrence of corona discharge.

Subsequently a halftone image was produced and visually observed whether raindrop like marks were present or not.

The charging grid was mounted on an image forming apparatus IMAGIO NEO 1350PRO from Ricoh Co. Ltd. at 10 C. and 15 RH. The image forming apparatus was brought into operation to copy 20 000 sheets of A4 size image and then powered down and left at rest for 12 hours. The image forming apparatus was powered up again and a halftone image was produced and visually observed whether the image density was even or not. At the same time the surface potential of the photoreceptor was measured particularly in a portion which was disposed immediately below the corona charger while being left.

B The image density was slightly uneven at an area corresponding to a portion of the photoreceptor which was disposed immediately below the corona charger while being left but allowable.

D The image density was uneven at an area corresponding to a portion of the photoreceptor which was disposed immediately below the corona charger while being left. Unallowable.

It is apparent from Table 8 that images are reliably produced when the volume resistance of the coating layer is 1.0 10 or less.

The procedure for preparation of the coating layer on the charging grid in Example 1 was repeated except that the composition of the coating liquid was changed to those shown in Table 9.

The resultant corona charger was subjected to the above described evaluations 1 to 3 using the above prepared photoreceptor 2 .

The evaluation results of Examples 52 to 63 and Comparative Examples 20 to 22 are shown in Tables 10 1 10 2 and 10 3.

It is apparent from Table 10 1 that when the coating layer includes a binder resin including both an alkyd resin and an amino resin the coating layer reliably adheres to the charging grid for an extended period of time. In particular when the content of the binder resin is from 10 to 60 by weight the coating layer is more intimately adhered to the charging grid the photoreceptor is more reliably charged and discharge products are more sufficiently removed.

It is apparent from Table 10 2 that the surface potential of the photoreceptor excesses the voltage applied to the charging grid and the resultant image is uneven when the coating layer include no conductive agent. In other words the photoreceptor is not reliably charged when the coating layer include no conductive agent. By contrast when the coating layer includes a conductive agent the surface potential of the photoreceptor is similar to that in a case the coating layer is not formed on the charging grid. In other words the photoreceptor is reliably charged when the coating layer includes a conductive agent.

It is apparent from Table 10 3 that corona chargers including a charging grid having a coating layer including a zeolite are capable of suppressing production of NOx effectively removing discharge products and suppressing the occurrence of image density unevenness and image blurring.

The procedure for preparation of the coating layer on the charging grid in Example 1 was repeated except that the composition of the coating liquid was changed to those shown in Table 11.

The resultant corona charger was subjected to the above described evaluations 1 to 3 using the above prepared photoreceptor 2 .

The evaluation results of Examples 64 to 74 and Comparative Examples 23 to 25 are shown in Tables 12 1 12 2 and 12 3.

It is apparent from Table 12 1 that when the coating layer includes a binder resin including a polyamide resin the coating layer reliably adheres to the charging grid for an extended period of time. In particular when the content of the binder resin is from 10 to 60 by weight the coating layer is more intimately adhered to the charging grid the photoreceptor is more reliably charged and discharge products are more sufficiently removed.

It is apparent from Table 12 2 that the surface potential of the photoreceptor excesses the voltage applied to the charging grid and the resultant image is uneven when the coating layer include no conductive agent. In other words the photoreceptor is not reliably charged when the coating layer include no conductive agent. By contrast when the coating layer includes a conductive agent the surface potential of the photoreceptor is similar to that in a case the coating layer is not formed on the charging grid. In other words the photoreceptor is reliably charged when the coating layer includes a conductive agent.

It is apparent from Table 12 3 that corona chargers including a charging grid having a coating layer including a zeolite are capable of suppressing production of NOx effectively removing discharge products and suppressing the occurrence of image density unevenness and image blurring.
