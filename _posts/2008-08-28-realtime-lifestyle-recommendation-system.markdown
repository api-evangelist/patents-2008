With reference to illustrative operations performed by cloud computing system are described. Additional fewer or different operations may be performed depending on the embodiment. The order of presentation of the operations of is not intended to be limiting. In an operation one or more lifestyle recommendation applications are received. For example the one or more lifestyle recommendation applications may include a relational database and stored procedure functions with superkeys compound keys and unique keys to sort through various data buckets parameters that are updated frequently through middleware system . The one or more lifestyle recommendation applications may be in a text format an object code format or an executable format. The received one or more lifestyle recommendation applications are stored to cloud computing system in an operation . User provided information is received in an operation . For example user provided information may include home and work vocation address age sex race sexual orientation daily weekly monthly and yearly income investment planning and implementation entertainment and media preferences daily weekly monthly yearly schedule spending habits vacation preferences restaurant preferences health medical and exercise regimen and history social habits political affiliations hobbies home home maintenance information children s needs family and friends dossier including birthdays and likes and dislikes personality profile etc.

In an operation user account information is requested given that the user has granted access to user account information to do so was received as part of the user provided information. In an operation the user account information is received. For example user account information may include any expressly authorized data that can be accessed by the one or more lifestyle recommendation applications of cloud computing system from the one or more user account information devices . . . . Thus user account information can include information obtained from the user s files and directories on one or more of the user s computing device s online accounts obtained from the one or more user account information devices . . . information obtained from other third party networked computers of family affiliations or friends that may relate to the user with the permission of the third parties etc. Access to these systems can allow the one or more lifestyle recommendation applications of cloud computing system to gather and synthesize information relating to the user s contacts including personal business and vendor contacts. Items such as media collections positioning system GPS information investment holdings bank statements and credit card accounts can also be utilized. In an operation the user information including the user provided information and the user account information is stored in cloud computing system .

In an operation general information that can be accessed by the one or more lifestyle recommendation applications of cloud computing system from the one or more general information devices . . . is monitored to provide additional input into the lifestyle recommendation process. The general information can include information from news services weather and traffic patterns health information travel information dining and entertainment guides dating services professional services time of day information and other researchable areas that may provide general reference data to assist in determining a recommendation for the user and are accessible by the one or more lifestyle recommendation applications of cloud computing system from the one or more general information devices . . . 

If a request is not received in an operation processing continues at operation to continuously monitor the one or more general information devices . . . for general information that may assist in determining a recommendation for the user in the future. If a request is received in operation processing continues at operation .

In operation a lifestyle recommendation is determined based on information received in the request on the general information of relevance to the user and on the stored user information. For example the request may indicate an exit the user s vehicle is approaching the vehicle functional status the date and time of day and the user information may include the user s eating preferences and when the user last ate based on both the user s eating habits and an up to date scan of the user s debit credit card information. The most time sensitive information may be processed first and the information delivered to the user s computing device s most likely to be accessible to middleware system based upon the information available. For example cloud computing system may receive information from middleware system that the user is approaching an intersection at 5 15 pm on a Friday evening. The received information does not include an indication of a mechanical issue with the vehicle so cloud computing system does not prioritize that information to recommend that the user pull over to a gas station at a nearby intersection. Instead cloud computing system associates the time of day with the user s habits to determine that the user frequently eats at a first nearby restaurant with a greater frequency than a second nearby restaurant. Based on the frequency of eating at the first nearby restaurant cloud computing system may send a recommendation to the user to see if a call should be placed to reserve a table for the user at the first nearby restaurant. The request may include an indication that the user is in their car. As a result cloud computing system contacts the user s cell phone via middleware system . Middleware system configures the user interface operating system and media to conform to the needs of the user s device.

As another example cloud computing system may prompt the user that it is his wife s birthday tomorrow if no purchase for her is indicated on his debit credit card statement. As a result cloud computing system may recommend that the user stop at his wife s favorite spa and pick up a gift certificate for treatments that his wife prefers and beauty products that are known to be available from a scan or system call to confirm the store s inventory.

In an operation the determined recommendation is sent to middleware system and processing continues at operation to continuously monitor the one or more general information devices . . . for general information that may assist in determining a recommendation for the user in the future.

With reference to illustrative operations performed by user computing device are described. Additional fewer or different operations may be performed depending on the embodiment. The order of presentation of the operations of is not intended to be limiting. In an operation a first request for a user to enter information is received. For example the user may access a website using a browser application which causes the first request to be received at user computing device . In an operation the request for information is presented to the user. For example the user may be presented with a series of questions to identify the user s preferences habits likes dislikes etc. In an operation the user information is received. In an operation user authorization information to access one or more user account information devices . . . including the user s computing device s is received. In an operation user device information is received which may include the type of device the operating system the hardware characteristics of the device etc. In an operation the received user information the received user authorization information and the received user device information is sent to middleware system in one or more messages. In an operation the recommendation system application is received and installed if necessary at the one or more user computing device s identified by the user device information.

After being received and installed if necessary the one or more user computing device s execute recommendation system application . If a request for a recommendation is received from the user in an operation processing continues at an operation . If a request for a recommendation is not received in operation processing continues at an operation . If a user location update is not received in operation processing continues at operation . If a user location update is received in operation processing continues at operation . For example a user may enter a location update or a GPS may be associated with user computing device such that an update is automatically sent for example periodically or after a defined travel distance etc. If an issue with a user device associated with user computing device is received from the user in operation processing continues at operation . If an issue with the user device associated with user computing device is not received in operation processing continues at operation to continuously monitor for a request for a recommendation and or for a user location update and or for an issue with the user device.

In operation a request is defined based on the operation that led to defining the request. In an operation the defined request is sent to middleware system . In an operation a recommendation is received from middleware system . In an operation the recommendation is presented at user computing device . For example a map may be displayed to the user indicating a restaurant or gas station location using output interface a recommendation may be presented to the user using output interface etc.

With reference to illustrative operations performed by middleware system are described. Additional fewer or different operations may be performed depending on the embodiment. The order of presentation of the operations of is not intended to be limiting. Middleware system defines the parameters for returning readable data to computing device using application programming interfaces for example associated with operating system compatibility display capability media player capability etc. In an operation the one or more lifestyle recommendation applications are sent to cloud computing system . In an operation the user information is received from user computing device . In an operation the received user information is sent to cloud computing system . In an operation the one or more recommendation system applications are sent to the user s computing device s identified in the received user information.

If a request is not received in an operation processing continues at operation to continuously monitor for a user request. If a request is received in operation processing continues at operation . In operation the received request is sent to cloud computing system . In an operation a recommendation is received from cloud computing system . In an operation the received recommendation is sent to user computing device .

The system continues to function on an ongoing basis noting when user computing device is on so that the user can be contacted. In the absence of user computing device being on lifestyle recommendation system may send recommendations in emails. The user may instruct lifestyle recommendation system to stop generating recommendations at any time to cache the recommendations or to modify the user s settings in any way including unsubscribing from lifestyle recommendation system . Lifestyle recommendation system can also print traditional mail or courier reminders as a service feature if selected by the user. Thus the user may receive real time recommendations to one or more of the user s computing devices using various communication methods. Some recommendations may be directed to specific devices based on parameters set by the user as part of the user device information. For example without an explicit user setting to the contrary lifestyle recommendation system may send vacation recommendations to the user s desktop or laptop computing device because that type of information is typically digested by the user in this setting versus a call or text message to a mobile device. Also this kind of information is usually not time sensitive.

The recommendation logic systems are persistently subject to evolve and be updated based on data available to lifestyle recommendation system . The programming changes can be automated based upon conditions that exist and are computed by cloud computing system . For example if salsa lessons were not popular in 2007 but become wildly popular in 2008 with married couples over 40 who reside in southern Georgia lifestyle recommendation system may update leisure activity recommendation data parameters for that demographic using news information from published trends and hot lists. Updated versions of the entire database logic can be exchanged between cloud computing system and middleware system for backup archival or auxiliary use.

Lifestyle recommendation system may create an affinity program for frequent users. Lifestyle recommendation system may charge users for use and or may charge advertisers for access to lifestyle recommendation system or integrate a hybrid economic model for use.
