This invention was made with Government support under Grant No. EAR 0421020 awarded by the National Science Foundation. The Government has certain rights in this invention.

The present invention relates to laser related uses of diamond. More particularly the present invention relates to laser related uses of single crystal diamond produced using Microwave Plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition MPCVD within a deposition chamber.

Diamond in addition to its gem properties is the hardest known material has the highest known thermal conductivity and is transparent to a wide variety of electromagnetic radiation. Diamond with its high Raman frequency shift 1332.5 cm combined with very high Raman gain coefficient g 15 cm GW G. A. Pasmanik Laser Focus World 35 137 1999 is also one of most interesting crystals for stimulated Raman scattering SRS generation. Monocrystalline or single crystal diamond in particular possess a wide range of important properties including a low coefficient of thermal expansion the highest known thermal conductivity chemical inertness wear resistance low friction and optical transparency from the ultra violet UV to the far infrared IR . Therefore it is valuable because of its wide range of applications in a number of industries and research applications in addition to its value as a gemstone.

For at least the last twenty years a process of producing small quantities of diamond by chemical vapor deposition CVD has been available. As reported by B. V. Spitsyn et al. in Vapor Growth of Diamond on Diamond and Other Surfaces Journal of Crystal Growth vol. 52 pp. 219 226 the process involves CVD of diamond on a substrate by using a combination of methane or another simple hydrocarbon gas and hydrogen gas at reduced pressures and temperatures of 800 1200 C. The inclusion of hydrogen gas prevents the formation of graphite as the diamond nucleates and grows. Growth rates of up to 1 m hour have been reported with this technique.

Subsequent work for example that of Kamo et al. as reported in Diamond Synthesis from Gas Phase in Microwave Plasma Journal of Crystal Growth vol. 62 pp. 642 644 demonstrated the use of Microwave Plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition MPCVD to produce diamond at pressures of 1 8 kPa at temperatures of 800 1000 C. with microwave power of 300 700 W at a frequency of 2.45 GHz. A concentration of 1 3 methane gas was used in the process of Kamo et al. Maximum growth rates of 3 m hour have been reported using this MPCVD process. In the above described processes and in a number of other reported processes the growth rates are limited to only a few micrometers per hour.

Recent efforts however have increased the growth rate quality and size of the diamonds grown in an MPCVD process.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 858 078 to Hemley et al. which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference is directed to an apparatus and method for diamond production.

U.S. application Ser. No. 11 438 260 filed May 23 2006 which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference is directed to producing colorless single crystal diamonds at rapid growth rate using Microwave Plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition MPCVD within a deposition chamber.

U.S. application Ser. No. 11 599 361 filed on Nov. 15 2006 which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference is directed to new uses for colorless single crystal diamonds produced at a rapid growth rate. The application is also directed to methods for producing single crystal diamonds of varying color at a rapid growth rate and new uses for such single crystal colored diamonds.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 420 879 issued May 30 1995 is directed to a solid state laser which includes synthetic diamond crystal as a medium of laser beam emission and generates a laser beam having a wavelength of 225 to 300 nm. The synthetic diamond crystal used in the invention is produced via a high pressure method not by chemical vapor deposition.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 667 999 issued on Dec. 23 2003 discloses a method and apparatus for cooling a high power laser oscillator or amplifier using diamond as an optically transparent heat transfer medium. The patent does not disclose the use of single crystal CVD diamond as a heat transfer medium.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 574 255 issued on Jun. 3 2003 discloses external cavity optically pumped semiconductor lasers that can include single crystal CVD diamond but as a film.

Accordingly the present invention is directed to new laser uses of single crystal CVD diamonds including uses as a frequency converter.

Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows and will be apparent in part from the description or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.

To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the present invention as embodied and broadly described an embodiment of the invention includes a laser comprising a diamond component the improvement being that the diamond component comprises single crystal CVD diamond.

In one embodiment the diamond component is produced by a method comprising controlling the temperature of a growth surface of the diamond such that the temperature of the growing diamond crystals is in the range of 900 1400 C. the diamond is mounted in a heat sink holder made of a material that has a high melting point and high thermal conductivity to minimize temperature gradients across the growth surface of the diamond growing single crystal diamond by microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition on the growth surface of a diamond in a deposition chamber having an atmosphere greater than 150 torr wherein the atmosphere comprises from about 8 to in excess of about 30 CHper unit of H.

In another embodiment all temperature gradients across the growth surface of the diamond are less than about 30 C.

In another embodiment all temperature gradients across the growth surface of the diamond are less than about 20 C.

In another embodiment the single crystal diamond is produced by a method further comprising the use of from about 5 to about 25 Oper unit of CHin the deposition chamber atmosphere.

Specific uses for the single crystal CVD diamond components in lasers can include heat sinks or optically transparent heat transfer media frequency converters elaton s optical windows Raman shifters gain sources and other optical components.

Another embodiment of the invention is a nonlinear crystalline material for Raman laser converters comprising a single crystal diamond.

It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.

Due to its extreme physical properties such as high hardness and high thermal conductivity synthetic diamond is used in many industrial and scientific applications. Given its high Raman frequency shift 1332.5 cm and a very high Raman gain coefficient g 15 cm GW G. A. Pasmanik Laser Focus World 35 137 1999 diamond has the potential to be an excellent crystal for stimulated Raman scattering SRS generation. As confirmed in a soon to be published paper single crystal CVD diamond is potentially an effective stimulated Raman scattering SRS crystalline materials for Raman laser converters.

Reference to the detailed methods for producing the single crystal CVD diamond used in the invention can be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 599 361 which as discussed above is incorporated herein by reference.

The various embodiments of the invention will be described with respect to which illustrates an embodiment of a pumped laser gain medium which includes active laser medium and mirrors and . The laser is comprised of a gain medium and a resonant optical cavity. The gain medium transfers external energy into the laser beam . Pump energy that is absorbed but not converted into laser energy becomes heat and must be removed. One or more heat sinks are in thermal connection with the active laser medium to remove unused heat.

The active laser medium or gain medium can be for example a solid state gain medium such as a Nd YAG material or in some embodiments single crystal CVD diamond. In general the heat flow path is substantially axial from the first surface of the laser gain medium .

As is known in the art the action of pumping a laser gain medium with energy produces stimulated emission of laser energy within the laser gain medium. Because only a portion of the pumped energy received by the laser gain medium is used in the stimulated emission process the energy absorbed but not used to promote stimulated emission produces heat within the laser gain medium. The heat generated within the laser gain medium can cause problems. Accordingly it is important to dissipate the heat using a heat sink that is optically and thermally coupled to the laser gain medium . The heat sink should be substantially optically transparent at both the lasing wavelength and the pump wavelength. Moreover it should have a very high thermal conductivity compared to the active medium.

In one embodiment heat sink comprises single crystal CVD diamond a material which has the aforementioned desired properties.

The laser output is passed along the optical axis through heat sink which does not absorb significant heat from the laser output since it is substantially transparent at the lasing frequency. Heat from the surface of the laser gain medium is transferred via the heat sink to a heat exchanger for dissipation to cool the interior of the laser gain medium.

In other embodiments single crystal CVD diamond can be used as a heat sink in other types of lasers including but not limited to thick disk lasers e.g. ND GGG 100 kW or less thick disk lasers zig zag amplifiers e.g. Nd and Yb mostly YAG around 5000 W single mode fiber lasers e.g. mostly Yb silica 1000 W single mode fiber lasers rod lasers e.g. Nd and Yb mostly YAG 1000 W rod lasers and thin disk amplifiers or lasers e.g. Nd and Yb mostly YAG 2000 W . In a preferred embodiment single crystal CVD diamond is used as a heat sink material in a thin disk laser which is readily cooled by a single crystal CVD diamond.

The pump optics which are not shown in and which produce pump light are arranged for multiple passes of the pump radiation. The heat is extracted in the longitudinal direction via the heat sink thus minimizing thermal lensing effects. This results in good beam quality and stable operation.

In one embodiment the one or more heat sinks comprise single crystal CVD diamond produced in accordance with U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 599 361.

Diamond produced by the methods disclosed in this application will be sufficiently large defect free and transparent so as to be useful in lasers as for example windows and optical components Raman shifters gain source laser emission media gain media heat sinks frequency converters and nonlinear crystalline material for Raman laser converters.

While the single crystal diamond used in the above described laser uses can be produced in accordance with the methods disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 599 361 it can also be produced according the other methods including for example those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 858 078 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 438 260.

As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof it should also be understood that the above described embodiments are not limited by any of the details of the foregoing description unless otherwise specified but rather should be construed broadly within its spirit and scope as defined in the appended claims and therefore all changes and modifications that fall within the metes and bounds of the claims or equivalence of such metes and bounds are therefore intended to be embraced by the appended claims.
