The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to stun grenades and in particular to flash bang type stun grenades.

To shock and distract an adversary during a forced entry the adversary can be shocked by creating a loud noise and a bright flash. Currently there are flash bang stun grenades on the market that accomplish this through a pyrotechnic energetic means. The pyrotechnic approach to creating the flash bang has limitations because the pyrotechnic mix is an integral combination of the flash and bang mixes. An advantage would be gained if each feature were to be independent of the other. Additionally the current pyrotechnic design technology is limited in its ability to prevent the combustion of adjacent materials as the stun grenade is initiated. The violent reaction of the energetics is difficult to control using known designs.

It is an object of the invention to provide a flash bang stun grenade having separate flash and bang sections.

One aspect of the invention is a stun grenade comprising a housing having at least a portion that is not opaque a light output section disposed in the housing the light output section comprising a pyrotechnic material a fuze coupled to the housing the fuze including a time delay column inserted into the housing and a noise output section comprising a lower portion of the time delay column and a pyrotechnic material disposed in the lower portion of the time delay column.

The grenade may further comprise a protective cover disposed around at least the noise output section.

In one embodiment the light output section may comprise a second housing having at least a portion that is not opaque the second housing being disposed in an upper portion of the housing the time delay column being inserted through the second housing and the time delay column including a port that opens into the second housing.

In a second embodiment the housing may comprise upper and lower portions the upper portion housing the noise output section and the lower portion housing the light output section.

The second embodiment may further comprise a firing pin disposed adjacent a bottom of the time delay column and a primer charge disposed adjacent the firing pin the primer charge communicating with the light output section.

Another aspect of the invention is a method of using a stun grenade comprising igniting a light output section at a first time and igniting a noise output section at a second time that is different than the first time.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

In the invention the light flash and sound bang output are isolated into individual events. An advantage of isolating the flash and the bang is that more or less of either reaction can be created without affecting the other. So if the intensity of the flash candlepower needs to be increased the brightness can be adjusted without affecting the noise level. Additionally isolating the flash and the bang allows one to control the timing of either the flash or the bang.

An advantage of flash bang grenades with variable timing delays is the ability to tailor or maximize the shock factor for various forced entry scenarios. Additionally the total amount of energetic material used can be reduced by separating the flash and the bang. Unlike the prior art the invention eliminates the simultaneous creation of flash and bang. Simultaneous initiation requires that only certain energetics can be used. On the other hand the invention can use less violent energetic reactions to create a similar flash and or bang.

In one embodiment of the invention the flash occurs before the bang. In another embodiment of the invention the bang occurs before the flash.

The light output section includes a housing containing pyrotechnic material for producing the flash. Pyrotechnic material can be for example magnesium wire or powder. At least a portion of the housing is not opaque and the entire housing may be translucent or transparent. Similarly at least a portion of the housing is not opaque and the entire housing may be translucent or transparent. Housings and may comprise for example glass or a polycarbonate. Housing is disposed in an upper portion of the housing . The time delay column is inserted through the housing . Housing can have a donut like shape to accommodate the time delay column .

The time delay column includes a port that opens into housing . A thin seal can be used to close port . When the grenade is initiated the flammable material in the time delay column burns and causes ignition of the pyrotechnic material via port . Pyrotechnic material produces the flash. The flammable material continues burning downward and ignites the pyrotechnic material that produces the bang. The fuze and time delay column of a standard U.S. Army fragmentation grenade may be used in the stun grenade with the addition of port .

A protective cover is disposed around at least the noise output section and can also be disposed around the light output section . The protective cover can comprise a semi rigid material having passageways there through such as plastic foam or sponge like material. To better contain fragments the passageways are maze like or labyrinthian. The cover can also absorb toxic gases.

For further protection from fragments a cylindrical sleeve may be disposed around the time delay column . The sleeve can comprise metal or plastic. A port is formed in sleeve and aligned with port in the time delay column .

The noise output section includes a lower portion of the time delay column . A pyrotechnic material is disposed in the lower portion . Ignition of the pyrotechnic material causes the bang or noise. Disposed above pyrotechnic material in delay column is a flammable material that provides a time delay as is well known in the art.

The light output section contains pyrotechnic material for producing the flash. Pyrotechnic material can be for example magnesium wire or powder. At least part of the lower portion of the housing is not opaque and may be translucent or transparent. Housing portions may comprise for example glass or a polycarbonate. Housing portions can be joined in a variety of ways for example threads adhesive welding etc.

A support member is disposed below the noise output section and supports a firing pin . When the grenade is initiated the flammable material in the time delay column burns and causes ignition of the pyrotechnic material . Pyrotechnic material produces the bang. Detonation of the pyrotechnic material forces firing pin into primer charge . Primer charge ignites pyrotechnic material which produces the flash.

A protective cover is disposed around at least the noise output section . The protective cover can comprise a semi rigid material having passageways there through such as plastic foam or sponge like material. To better contain fragments the passageways are maze like or labyrinthian. The cover can also absorb toxic gases.

For further protection from fragments a cylindrical sleeve not shown similar to the sleeve of may be disposed around the time delay column . The sleeve need not include the port shown in .

An advantage of the inventive stun grenade is that much of the energetic material of known stun grenades can be replaced with alternate materials that are less toxic but still provide the required noise and light outputs. In addition the sum of the explosive outputs of the flash and bang sections of the invention can be much less than the explosive output of a conventional stun grenade because of the separation of the flash and bang materials. Thus users of the stun grenade are safer.

The invention may be used not only for hostile enclosure raids but can be used to complement crowd control especially in dark areas devices police surveillance and security activities. The invention can also be used as a personal protection device.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
