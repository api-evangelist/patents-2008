title: OC2 oriented connections 2
abstract: The invention discloses design concepts and means and methods that can be used for enhancing the reliability and extending the operating life of electronic devices, and assemblies incorporating such devices, and substrates and/or PCBs, especially if such assemblies are exposed to severe environmental conditions such as thermal cycling or power cycling. The main thrust of the invention is to provide flexible joints, such as columns, between the attached components, and preferably to orient such joints, so that they would present their softest bending direction towards the thermal center or fixation point of the assemblies. Joints with rectangular or elongated cross-section are preferred, and they should be oriented so that the wide face of each joint would be facing the thermal center, perpendicular to the thermal deformation ray emanating from the thermal center towards the center of each respective joint. The concepts apply equally to leadless packages as well as to leaded packages.

This application is a DIVISIONAL UTILITY patent application BASED ON patent application Ser. No. 10 765 772 entitled Oriented connections for leadless and leaded packages which was filed on Jan. 26 2004 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 433 201 which in turn is a NON PROVISIONAL UTILITY patent application which in turn could have been considered to be a CONTINUATION OR CONTINUATION IN PART application from patent application Ser. No. 09 947 240 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 254 889 entitled Interconnection Devices and from patent application Ser. No. 10 075 060 now U.S. Pat. No. 6 884 707 entitled Interconnection .

This application is claiming the priority and benefits of all the above mother applications and all the references of those mother applications all of which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.

The Mother application Ser. No. 10 765 772 was claiming the priority and benefits of the same references which were claimed by its two mother applications. These references are the following six previous applications which include four provisional patent applications and two non provisional utility patent applications all of which were incorporated herein in their entirety by reference 

The References of the Mother application Ser. No. 10 765 772 can be visualized easier in the following TABLE 1 

Please review specifically the following sections in the following TABLE 2 in preparation for this present application 

In addition the following references relate to both groups of products covered by this present application i.e. the Leaded Devices as well as the Leadless Devices .

I would like to incorporate here the three following papers which I had attached at the end of Ref6 as appendices to that document and were numbered as Additional Documents .

Papers 1 2 were intended to be published at the Eighth Annual Pan Pacific Microelectronics Symposium 2003 SMTA Kohala Coast Island of Hawaii Hi. Feb. 18 20 2003. This conference is organized by the SMTA Surface Mount Technology Association 5200 Wilson Road Suite 215 Edina Minn. 55424 1343 Tel 952 920 7682 Fax 952 926 1819 E Mail smta smta.org www www.smta.org. However because of financial difficulties I cancelled my attendance and withdrew the papers from the conference. However the papers as intended to be presented were included in Ref6.

Paper 3 was presented at the IPC Printed Circuits EXPO 2003 IPC Long Beach Calif. Mar. 25 27 2003. This conference is organized by the IPC Lincolnwood Ill. Tel 847 790 5325.

I would also like to refer to the following paper which I had presented in connection with my old CCMD Solder Columns which I had developed around 1982 86.

This paper shows that a solder column that has a wide base near the pads and a narrower waist about the middle of the height is better suited to withstand the ill effect of the TCE Mismatch between the package and the substrate. The amount of flexing and the level of bending stresses become more favorable with this kind of general shape than with a column that is uniform in cross section throughout its whole length. I would like to refer to such a shape as the starved column shape. I will talk more about that further down below.

The present invention relates generally to means and methods for attaching devices to each other more particularly to attaching electronic devices and packages on to each other or on to substrates or Printed Circuit Boards PCBs etc. The invention relates to both leadless packages such as BGAs or LCCCs as well as to leaded packages such as DIPs.

The invention further relates to the reliability and long operating life of assemblies incorporating such devices and more specifically when such assemblies are exposed to harsh operating or environmental conditions such as power cycling or thermal cycling and more specifically yet when the different components of such assemblies have different Thermal Coefficients of Expansion TCEs what is referred to TCE Mismatch.

Furthermore the invention relates to the connecting means such as leads legs solder joints and the like both for the leadless as well as the leaded devices and the shape and orientation positioning of these connecting means especially as to how all this would affect the reliability and long operating life of such assemblies especially when exposed to the above mentioned operating conditions.

The products covered by this present application can be divided into two groups. The first group includes any leadless devices such as Ball Grid Array Packages BGAs Leadless Ceramic Chip Carriers LCCCs or any other leadless packages. The second group includes any leaded devices such as Dual In Line Packages DIPs or any other leaded packages.

I will first provide a general introduction and background applicable to both groups of products and then another one more expanded applicable to each of the two groups of products separately.

Note The examiner may decide that both groups of products are so related that they can be processed as one application. However if the examiner decides that they should be divided into two separate applications then I would abide by that decision. Please advise.

In my opinion there is nothing in the Prior Art that resembles the concepts covered by this present invention.

The only thing that could be considered prior art is what has been covered in my prior applications i.e. in Ref1 through Ref6 which were cited listed in the cross reference section at the beginning of the application. However this present application is either a continuation or a continuation in part to those references.

The main object of this invention is to improve and enhance the reliability and long operating life of assemblies incorporating leadless and or leaded devices especially when such devices are mounted on or attached to each other or to substrates or Printed Circuit Boards PCBs and more specifically when such assemblies are exposed to harsh operating or environmental conditions such as power cycling or thermal cycling and more specifically yet when the different components of such assemblies have different Thermal Coefficients of Expansion TCEs TCE mismatch .

The reliability issues can be divided into several different groups. The most talked about issue is with surface to surface interconnections mounting and is the fact that the solder joints may crack and or delaminate from the solder pads and end up with open circuits.

One new reliability issue is related to the new lead free solders that are being mandated to be used soon to avoid problems related to solders containing lead Pb . A new fact is starting to get heard about these new lead free solders. It seems that there may be problems with the copper solder pads delaminating from the Printed Circuit Board PCB during the reflow mounting process or at least getting weaker. See Ref13 above.

So if this is true then the concepts presented in this present invention will improve the reliability of such assemblies as well because they will reduce the stresses on the pads and hence less chance for them to delaminate or to fail prematurely.

It has been known in the industry that when two bodies are attached together like in the case of a leadless electronic package mounted to a PCB and the assembly is exposed to harsh environmental conditions such as power cycling or thermal cycling the joints between the two bodies can get overstressed and may fail prematurely. It has also been know shown that if the joints are elongated like columns or leads or legs instead of being wide short or stubby connections then the life expectancy of such assemblies gets extended.

Furthermore it was mentioned in the previous referenced applications especially in Ref3 as well as in Ref5 that Oriented Leads or Columns can improve the life and reliability of assemblies incorporating packages and substrates especially if the components have some TCE mismatch and if they are exposed to temperature fluctuations. I have also provided some sketches and drawings illustrating what I mean as listed in Table 2 above.

Ref3 and especially Ref5 include a lot of descriptions and explanations about orienting the leads so that they would face the thermal center or thermal fixation point of the packages or rather of the assemblies. I will refer to the explanations given in those cited references and will not repeat the explanations here.

One method was to use a flat leadframe with the leg blanks oriented and radiating out directly from the plastic body i.e. coming out of the plastic body not in a direction that is perpendicular to the sides of the body but at an angle in the correct more desirable radial direction. The drawings were small and may have not been able to convey many of the details. I will show here in this specification some drawings that will clarify that embodiment.

However I have shown in Ref6 another way of achieving the same end goal but where the individual legs or leg blanks would first protrude out from the package body in an orthogonal direction i.e. similar to the present conventional way and then each leg blank would curve while still flat a certain part of a circle and then end up in a special desired direction for each specific leg as will be explained in the following specifications

In the following pages I will include and describe some additional examples of how we can capitalize on this theory i.e. using oriented leads or columns.

The invention can basically be described simply by saying that it proposes to observe two specific things when attaching two bodies or components together especially when the bodies are expected to be exposed to harsh environmental conditions.

1. Make the connecting elements which will join the two bodies together to have some flexibility to allow and or compensate for dimensional variations between the two bodies e.g. from thermal expansion or contraction. One example is to make the joints like tall columns i.e. slender elongated and possibly curvilinear elements ideally situated at a generally perpendicular angle to the general surface of the bodies. We would refer to them as columns . The columns would act as flexible joints and will provide for a way to compensate for the deformation of the bodies under the prevailing conditions. Note If the dimensional variations are expected to be in more than one direction then the flex joints should be able to compensate for these variations in all their directions. Hence the flex joints should be able to flex in all the respective directions. This is why these joints could be curvilinear to have more than one degree of freedom yet to be strong enough to still retain the bodies together as required.

2. If the cross section of these columns is not round or square then orient the columns so that they would provide the least resistance to flexing. For example if the columns would have an oblong or elongated or rectangular cross section that is generally longer than its width or in other words has a long axis and a short axis then these columns would be oriented so that their wider surfaces would be facing generally in the direction toward the thermal center or the fixation point of the package or the assembly. We can also rephrase that by saying that each column would be oriented such that the short axis of its cross section would be in a direction of its respective thermal deformation ray which would be emanating from the thermal center of the package or from the fixation point of the package and going to the center of the cross section of each column.

In addition some variations in the shape and construction of the columns are covered by the present invention as will be described below together with some additional features.

The main object of the invention is to mount such devices especially electronic packages on their substrates using special connecting means hereinafter referred to as Oriented Connections so as to improve the performance life and or reliability of such assemblies especially with respect of Power Cycling Thermal Cycling columns and or Shock and Vibration columns anchor .

The connecting means would generally be situated between the device and the substrate. They would be situated with the general axis of their elongated body to be generally perpendicular to the general surfaces of the device and the substrate. The connecting means would also have their cross section normal to their body axis such that the cross section would be elongated or oblong or rectangular.

Oriented Connections are connecting means which have an elongated cross section whether rectangular or oblong or any other shape where the cross section has one large dimension or length and a shorter dimension generally perpendicular to the first one or width. Consequently we can say that the cross section would have one long axis and one short axis perpendicular to the long axis.

These connecting means would be oriented such that the short axis of the cross section would be in line with or approximately in line with a thermal deformation ray which emanates from the thermal center or fixation point of the device and which radiate towards the center or near the center of the cross section of the connecting means.

The invention will also show at least two or more ways of shaping the legs leg blanks of leaded packages in a certain specific way for each individual leg of these packages. This can be accomplished by twisting the legs or by shaping the leg blank in such a way that a simple folding operation would accomplish the same end result.

In the case of leaded packages most of the legs in Ref3 and Ref5 were twisted to orient them as desired. In a few cases the legs were not twisted but were folded . See Ref5 FIGS. 20 through 22 FIGS. 25 and 26 and FIGS. 32 through 40 as well as in Ref3 pages PP D 5 and 6 82 through 87 99 and 100 and pages PP AD 45 and 46. This Invention will provide more examples of leaded plastic packages with oriented legs without twisting the legs. It will also give more examples of solder pads which could accept both the conventional package legs as well as the new proposed package legs which were shown in Ref3 pages PP D 104 and 105 as well as in Ref5 FIGS. 23 and 24.

In the case of leadless packages the invention will expand on the concepts shown in Ref3 pages PP D 1 42 and PP AD 66 as well as many of the concepts described in Ref5 under the group of leaded packages.

When we talk about packages or the like being mounted on Printed Circuit Board PCB or substrates or the like we most of the time visualize that the PCB is laying on a horizontal table and that the package is being mounted to it where the body of the package is parallel to the PCB. Hence we say the PCG and the package are horizontal. If the package is leaded we then say that the legs of the package are vertical. If the package is leadless but we want to provide columns between the package and the PCB then we say that the columns will be vertical figuring that they will be perpendicular to the general package body direction and or to the PCB general position.

Usually the legs of leaded packages are made of flat sheet metal blanked and formed etc. The legs are vertical and the legs axes are also vertical. We kind of ignore the part of the legs that is close to the package body and that is still horizontal.

Usually the legs cross section is rectangular where the width of the rectangle is the thickness of the sheet metal and the length of the rectangular is several times larger than its width.

We also talk about the face of the leg or the wide face of the leg which is the side of the leg formed by the length of the cross section rectangle. I will refer to this face of the leg and state that it should face the thermal center of the package or of the assembly. It is as if a person is standing inside the leg and facing in that direction.

When a body is at room temperature or at any initial temperature and then it gets heated or cooled it expands or contracts respectively. The changes in its dimensions correspond to the amount of temperature change and to the dimensions of the body. They also correspond to the Thermal Coefficient of Expansion TCE of the body s material. These changes in dimensions will be referred to hereinafter as Thermal Deformation .

FIGS. 4 and 5 in Ref5 drawings sheets 4 72 and 5 72 illustrate the concept of the thermal center . If a package is heated or cooled then the body of the package will expand or contract and every point on in the body will move along a certain line or ray in a direction of the lines shown in the figures. Each of these lines or rays has 2 ends obviously. One end is at the individual point of the body being considered and the other end is at some fixed point in the body. If the point of the body is fixed or anchored at a certain point in space then this fixation point will be the other end of that line or ray. I will refer to such lines as the thermal deformation rays or simply rays . I will refer to that fixed point as the thermal fixation point or center .

If on the other hand the package is not fixed at any specific point but is simply attached to another body via the leads legs or solder joints which are evenly distributed along the body then we can say that the package is floating . In this case we can consider that the geometric center of the package is its thermal center . This of course assumes that the package is homogeneous and that all its elements are equal and symmetrical and balanced. It also assumes that all the joints are approximately equally strong or stiff and equally distributed around on the package. So in such as case all the thermal deformation rays will start at the geometrical center of the package which will be considered to be its thermal center as well and the rays will emanate from that center and go in a direction towards any specific point under consideration.

There will be other definitions that will be introduced during the course of describing the invention. In most cases I will try to highlight the fact that these are new definitions.

While the invention is susceptible of various modifications and alternative constructions certain illustrated embodiments thereof have been shown in the drawings and will be described below in detail. It should be understood however that there is no intention to limit the invention to the specific form disclosed but on the contrary the invention is to cover all modifications alternative constructions and equivalents falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the claims.

While I am describing the drawing in more details I will at the same time explain the technology basis of the invention whenever applicable. I will also include a number of examples in this section which should be considered as part of the embodiments for the purpose of this application as well.

This description covers more than one invention. The inventions are based partly on the same technology platform but then each of the inventions has some additional features of its own. Not being an expert in handling patents I would like to leave it to the patent examiner to decide on the number of the inventions contained and how to split one invention from the other.

I will also cover in this application a number of embodiments for some of the described inventions. Some will relate to the legs of the packages others will relate to the solder pads which are part of the PCB or substrates or other devices and which are to accept the legs of the above packages.

Moreover I will describe some additional features related to some individual applications. These new features are not based on the common basic technology that I started with at the beginning.

All the information in this section was part of Ref6 which was incorporated in this application by reference at the beginning of the application. I could simply refer the reader to the text in that Ref6 and not repeat it here. This would reduce the size of this formal application. Please advise.

Also although I have copied all the text here from Ref6 I have not included the figures. I simply mentioned the figures as being figures in Ref6. I hope that this is correct and acceptable. However if Examiner desires I could very easily include either all or a few of those figures here in this specification as well.

Basically most of the information in this section could be considered as part of Material Science or Metallurgy or Physics . Probably no new information for most of the readers. It is here simply to describe certain physical phenomena and to highlight certain observations and to help in understanding and accepting the concepts presented in the present invention.

Standard conventional leadless packages e.g. Ball Grid Arrays BGA or Leadless Ceramic Chip Carriers LCCC have solder pads that are either rectangular square or round circular in shape. Their dimensions are usually covered by JEDEC Standards or the like.

So far all such packages have been either square or rectangular where their two main central axes are orthogonal i.e. perpendicular to each other and the sides of the packages are straight and parallel to the central axes. The solder pads also have always been ORTHOGONAL in their location and or shape as well. By this I mean that the solder pads are laid out along rows and columns that are orthogonal and parallel to the central axes and sides of the package body. Examples of such packages are the BGAs and LCCCs mentioned above. It is also important to notice that when the pads are not round i.e. when they are square or rectangular then the pads sides also are orthogonal and parallel to the sides and central axes of the package.

Another basis for the proposals in this invention is the fact that in general a solder joint usually follows or imitates the shape of the solder pad which it is attached to. Another thing is that the distance between the two pads that are being attached together most of the time one pad on top of the other and the amount of solder present at the joint to start with also affect the shape of the solder joint.

I will first explain what I mean by that and then show how we can take advantage of this phenomenon to create the kind of solder joints that would work best for us.

To do that I will use two cases. Case 1 is where we have one solder pad with some solder molten and reflown on top of this pad. Then Case 2 is where we have two solder pads being joined together with a certain amount of solder between them and with a certain distance between the pads.

Note to the reader Most of the text in this section had been included in Ref6. Ref6 has also a number of figures that go along with this text. I will not duplicate those figures here in this application. I would rather like to refer the reader to those figures in Ref6.

Solder is well known for its high surface tension and its strong capillary characteristic and its affinity to wet to surfaces of materials that are wettable to it. Of course this happens when the solder is molten and is free to move around and when the wettable surfaces are also hot enough and clean as well so that the solder would not freeze and would adhere to those surfaces. As a result when we have a proper amount of solder and reflow it on top of a pad made of solder wettable material like copper then the molten solder will spread on the surface of the pad and create a layer of solder on the surface of the pad. Of course the solder pad itself should also be hot enough and up to the proper temperature and should be clean as well.

If the amount of solder is enough then the solder will cover the whole surface of the pad. If there is still enough solder then we will see a pillow of solder with the pad as its base and a dome formed on top of the pad. The height of the dome will depend on the available amount of solder. The edges of the dome will be touching the edges of the pad. If the pad is round then the pillow will have a round base too. If the pad is rectangular then the pillow s base will be rectangular exactly like the pad see Ref6 FIG. B 6 sketch 9 Not Shown which I will talk more about later and if the pad is irregular in shape then the base of the pillow will have a corresponding irregular shape similar to that of the pad as in Ref6 FIG. B 7 sketch G. Not Shown which I will talk more about later also .

Ref11 which is the Article that was attached as part of Ref6 pages OC A 06 through 11 Zero Clearance . . . showed in its FIG. 4 page OC A 09 some solder pads that are covered with solder masks. The mask in the Left Hand Side LHS picture does not completely cover the neck or tail of the solder pads which is the part of the copper trace that connects the different pads together. The picture on the Right Hand Side RHS shows the better solder mask which does not leave any part of the neck exposed. The article is touting this new solder mask technique for other reasons but this new technique RHS has another advantage. It produces a balanced solder joint.

One of my business associates and let s call him Bill was telling me about a problem they had when they solder reflowed their BGAs on their Substrates. Some of the solder pads had necks as shown in the RHS picture of the above article. Bill was saying that the solder joints that had these necks were distorted in shape. They were not round as they were supposed to but had a shape that followed roughly the shape of the pad with the neck. And the joints were pulling sideways. So in order to compensate for that Bill put an additional fake or idle neck on the opposite side of the existing neck to balance out the solder joint. This gave me one hint for my proposed designs here.

My Ref6 FIGS. A 1 through A 4 Not Shown illustrate the concept in some more detail. Ref6 FIG. A 1 shows three solder pads connected together by necks as in the figures of the article mentioned above. I have drawn on one of the pads a solder joint roughly as Bill had described it to me. Ref6 FIG. A 2 shows an illustration of a board with two solder pads with a neck connecting them. A solder mask covers the board leaving an opening around each of the solder pads. The open circle in the mask is too large and leaves a certain portion of the neck exposed as seen in the figure. Ref6 FIG. A 3 shows the shape of the solder joint connecting two boards or two components having solder pads with similar necks e.g. a BGA on top of a board. Here I am not showing the top pad. I will talk more about joining two components further down below . The joint here would have a protrusion which I will refer to as the neck knob . Ref6 FIG. A 4 shows the cross section of the solder joint at different elevations. The top and bottom sketch shows the cross section near the pads while the middle sketch shows the cross section near the middle of the height of the joint. You can see that the middle section is more rounded and the neck knob is not as pronounced not as angular as in the two other cross sections. The top and bottom sections are influenced heavily by the shape of the pads while the middle section is less influenced by them and so the high surface tension of the solder takes over and tries to smoothen out the shape of the column and to make the cross section more uniform and more round.

If we keep increasing the amount of solder that will be reflown over the pad then we will notice the following progression of events.

First with just barely enough solder to cover the surface of the pad and assuming that there is enough to cover the whole surface of the pad then the solder pillow will be very thin and not tall at all. The edges of the pillow will show a slight small wetting angle that is the angle between the surface of the pad and the outer upper surface of the pillow will be only a few degrees say 5 degrees for argument s sake.

Then if we add more solder to the pillow and while the solder is still molten then the pillow will increase in height or thickness. We will also notice that the wetting angle will increase. It can become 15 degrees.

By adding more solder and keeping it molten then the pillow will become fatter and higher but its edges of its base which is touching the pad will still be confined to the shape of the pad. The wetting angle will become larger until it would reach a 90 degrees angle. Here we can say that the pillow s edges are vertical and stay vertical for a certain height and then taper down inwards to the center of the pillow so that at the center the surface of the pillow is horizontal again as expected. Assuming that the pad is horizontal.

If we add more solder yet then the wetting angle would be larger than 90 degrees. This means that the solder pillow will become larger than its base. The base of the pillow will still have the same shape of the pad but the pillow will have a belly that bulges out beyond the pad. We can say that its footprint has become larger than its base.

If we keep adding more solder then we may reach a point where the solder may form a solder ball. The ball may still have a base that resembles the shape of the pad but gradually the ball would become more like a sphere.

If the pad is round then the solder ball will keep its true spherical shape or pretty close to it. If the pad had a different shape other than round say like a rectangle then the solder pillow will start as a rectangular base and then when it reaches the proportions of a ball then the ball would be more oblong like a watermelon say.

Case 2 Two Solder Pads being Joined Together. One on Top of the Other . See Ref6 FIGS. B 1 Through B 7.

We can start by having both pads having the same shape. The solder when molten will wet the bottom pad and try to cover its whole surface. When that is accomplished and if the amount of solder is appropriate and if the solder had already reached and touched the top pad then it will wet to the top pad as well and will try to have the shape of the top pad as well.

If the volume of solder is correct then the solder joint between the two pads will have its edge walls almost vertical and straight. If both pads were round then the solder joint would look like a perfect uniform round disk. See Ref6 FIG. B 1. If the pads were square then the solder joint would look like a perfect square block. See Ref6 FIG. B 2. If the pads were rectangular then the solder joint would be like a perfect prism or parallelepiped. See Ref6 FIG. B 3.

The height of the solder joint will be affected by a number of factors. If the vertical distance between the pads is controlled by some external means e.g. a mechanical fixture or a solid metal ball placed between the two components to act as a spacer then the volume of the solder joint should correspond to the space between the two pads which would be proscribed by equal to the surface areas of any of the two pads times the distance between the two pads.

If on the other hand there is no mechanical fixturing holding the space fixed and constant then probably the weight of the top component will affect the final distance between the pads. There will be a balance between the weight pushing downwards and the surface tension of the molten solder trying to keep the solder shape more as a ball thus pushing upwards to come up with some case of equilibrium. The result could be that even for the ideal volume of solder we would get a shorter joint which would bulge out more or less depending on the magnitude of the top weight pushing downwards on top of the solder joint.

Suppose again that we are starting with the ideal volume of solder and that we are using a fixture to control the space between the two pads. When the solder is molten and the solder has wetted both bottom and top pads then we move and adjust the distance between the top pad with respect to the lower one. If the distance between the pads is correct and just right then the edge walls of the solder joint will be fairly vertical and the solder joint would be uniform in cross section.

Now suppose that the fixture moves and brings the top pad down a small amount. We would see that the solder joint would bulge out as described above. The cross section at the belly will be larger than at either top or bottom pad. Of course this has to happen while the solder is still molten and has to be done very carefully so as not to disturb the joint too badly and break it open.

Now suppose we do the opposite. We let the fixture raise lift the top pad away from the bottom pad. Once we go above and beyond the correct ideal height then we would notice that the solder joint would become thinner at the middle of its height. I suppose that it is relatively clear to the reader that by controlling the height or distance between the top and the bottom pad we can control the shape of the solder joint. The larger the distance between the pads the slimmer the joint. The size of the cross section near the middle of the solder height would vary inversely with the distance between the pads. That is of course assuming that we do not change the original volume of the solder at the joint and assuming of course that all this is done while the solder is still molten and it is all done very carefully and without too much shaking and without disturbing the solder so much as to break the joint.

The following set group of figures drawings marked B show various sets of pads and each set consists of a pair of such pads but at a different distance for each pair. The amount volume of solder in each case is supposed to be the same and constant. The idea here is to show how we could control the shape of the solder column so as to achieve certain goals.

I will show how we could obtain solder columns that are more flexible under bending and that would enhance the operating life of the assembly as compared to the conventional Solder Balls that are popular in the market nowadays.

Ref6 FIG. B 1 Not Shown shows three pairs of round solder pads each pair consisting of one pad on top of another with a certain distance gap between the two pads. I have marked the pairs as 4 5 and 6. The distance gap between the pads in sketch 4 is small the distance in sketch 5 is larger and the distance in sketch 6 is still larger yet. Assuming that we do not change the volume of solder between the pads then it is clear that the joint will be skinnier smaller diameter at the belly the higher the distance gap between the pads.

Ref6 FIG. B 2 shows a similar arrangement but with square pads. Again the sketches try to illustrate that the solder joints will be skinnier when we increase the distance gap between the pads.

Ref6 FIG. B 3 again shows a similar arrangement but with rectangular pads. Again the sketches try to illustrate the same fact that if the pads are pulled out away from each other the joint will become skinnier the larger the distance gap between the pads.

Here I am also showing the area and shape of the cross section of the solder joint at about the middle of its height which I will refer to as the waist of the joint or simply the waist . Sketch 4 shows the situation where the distance gap between the pads is small and the waist is still relatively fat. Sketch 5 shows the pads pulled apart more than in sketch 4 and the waist is slightly smaller than at the base pads as shown in the top view. Sketch 6 shows that the pads have been pulled still further more apart and the waist is still skinnier yet.

Ref6 FIG. B 5 shows a series of pad pairs with the distance gap between the pads in each pair increasing progressively as the pairs go from left to right. It also shows how the solder joint would look like when the gap between the pads gets higher and higher or larger and larger. The pairs r4 5 and 6 were shown in Ref6 FIG. B 3 earlier. Here we can see that the pair 7 and 8 may still be OK and the waist there is getting still smaller and smaller or skinnier and skinnier. When we reach a certain large gap like the one with pair 9 the solder joint would break and be interrupted. The solder will separate into two portions. The portion still hanging on to the top pad would look more like a pillow hanging down from the top pad and may try to look like a tear drop except that the shape of the pad rectangular in this case and the surface tension of the solder material would influence the shape of the solder pillow. The portion of solder material remaining on the bottom pad would look like another pillow whose shape would depend on the volume of solder available there. See my above discussion about this.

Ref6 FIG. B 7 shows a variety of sketches related to what I have discussed earlier above. Sketch G is particularly interesting. It illustrates the fact that the solder joint would adopt the shape of the pad that it is attached to and then when the solder gets farther away from the pad then the solder gets away from the influence of the pad shape and gets more under the influence of its high surface tension. The latter tries to force the solder to become more like a ball or a cylinder. This would be the basis for our attempt to manipulate the shape of the joint and its cross section so that we would obtain solder joints that have ideal cross section shapes so as in turn we would optimize the operating life of our assemblies. For example by adding the four protrusions which I refer to as Mickey Mouse Ears at the corners of the rectangular pad as shown we could force the solder joint to have a waist cross section that would be more rectangular i.e. with sharper square corner instead of rounded fillets in contrast with the waist shown in Ref6 FIGS. B 3 and B 4. We could also refer to this pad shape as the dog bone shaped pad.

Now we will take all the above and go to the next step and apply it to create the proposed solutions as per the invention.

The invention discloses design concepts and means and methods that can be used for enhancing the reliability and extending the operating life of electronic devices and assemblies incorporating such devices and substrates and or PCBs especially if such assemblies are exposed to severe environments such as thermal cycling or power cycling. The main thrust of the invention is to provide flexible joints such as columns between the attached components and preferably to orient such joints so that they would present their softest bending direction towards the thermal center or fixation point of the assemblies. Joints with rectangular or elongated cross section are preferred and they should be oriented so that the wide face of each joint would be facing the thermal center perpendicular to the thermal deformation ray emanating from the thermal center towards the center of each respective joint. The concepts apply equally to leadless packages as well as to leaded packages.

The same applies to other packages such as BGAs where the pads are located on multiple rows or on a matrix not only along one row near the periphery of the package.

In Ref5 I have proposed to have the legs of packages to be oriented such that their wide surfaces would be facing the thermal center of the package and or the assembly. I have described that in Ref5 so I don t think I need to repeat the explanations and or the reasons in this present application again. See particularly FIGS. 4 and 5 in Ref5.

It is preferred to use columns as the interconnecting elements to join chips packages etc. to substrates or boards instead of short stubby joints. Such short joints usually undergo mostly shear stresses . I prefer to have tall joints which would act like columns and would undergo mostly bending stresses . The reason is that such columns would act as flex joints between the two components and would absorb the dimensional differences when such an assembly would be exposed to temperature fluctuations. These flex joints would then be under bending stresses compared with the short stubby joints which would be under shear stresses. And by selecting the proper dimensions for the columns we can get the bending stresses down to a level that would not reduce the life expectancy of these joints but would extend it to an acceptable operating life. PS Since solder relaxes it is not usually proper to talk about endurance limit like with steel. With solder alloys and the like the S N curve keeps dropping down almost indefinitely. But we can specify a maximum bending stress which would give us a good long or acceptable life expectancy or in other words the cross section s short axis would be in line with or approximately in line with the thermal deformation ray from the thermal center of the device to the point under consideration.

2. It was also explained that if such columns have a cross section that is rectangular or elongated in shape then it would be beneficial to orient the column and its cross section such that the wider face of the column would be facing toward the thermal center of the package or of the assembly.

Based on the above I am proposing to create solder joints to be tall almost like columns and where the columns would have cross sections that are more elongated than circular and that are oriented such that their wider surface of the columns would be facing the thermal center TC of the package or of the anticipated assembly or the short axis of the cross section in line with the thermal deformation rays.

FIRST I want that the joints between two devices attached together to allow for dimensional changes without getting overstressed and without failing prematurely. I propose to make such joints as tall elements such as columns with their column axes generally perpendicular to the general surfaces of the devices. This applies to solder joints or any other legs or leads or elements joining two devices as such.

SECOND I want to make the solder joints so that the joints would have a rectangular or elongated cross section if not round or square shape or any other symmetrical shape and

THIRD I want that the wide side of each joint would be oriented so as to face the thermal center or fixation point or in other words the short axis of the joint cross section would be approximately in line with its respective thermal deformation ray.

The detrimental effects of Thermal Expansion and Contraction on the joints between the components e.g. the package and the substrate will be minimized.

As a side effect of the above the resistance to shock and vibration will be enhanced for two reasons. First the fact that the leads beams are shaped to have their flat faces oriented to the thermal center or the thermal fixation point makes it that some of the leads will almost always be present to withstand shock forces coming from different angle to the package. Second we can calculate the natural frequency of the joints or leads based on their length and geometry or we can empirically generate a relation between their length height and their frequency. Then by knowing what vibration range or vibration spectrum we want the package to withstand we can then select the most appropriate joint or lead dimensions to suit the specific individual case.

Items 2 8 9 10 12 14 15 16 17 and 18 in Table 2 above show examples of such legs i.e. attached to the periphery of the package. I will not elaborate much more here on these legs because I think the idea is already clear enough and covered enough in Ref3 and Ref5.

Items 3 4 5 6 7 13 and 19 in Table 2 above show legs that are attached to the surface of the packages i.e. the surface facing the other component to which the package will be connected. We can call them surface mounted.

This kind of surface mounted leads legs joints will be the main topic of the first group of products in this application while leaded packages will be in the second group.

A. Discrete leads such as those shown in items 4 5 6 7 and 13. These could be preformed and could be soldered at both ends i.e. one end to be soldered to the package while the other end to be soldered to the substrate. We could also envision that we could use an appropriate conductive adhesive instead of solder to attach the leads at either end. The leads would be oriented during the attachment process as shown in item 4 7 and 13 as per this invention.

B. Discrete tape bonded leads. These would be tape ribbon bonded as shown in item 20 at one end to one of the components preferably the package. The other end of the lead would be soldered attached by some means e.g. conductive adhesive to the substrate. Again the leads would be oriented preferably during the bonding operation so as to face the thermal center or the thermal fixation point see definitions of the assembly as per this invention.

C. Discrete Solder Columns Here again we can have a number of variations and sub variations. I will describe some of them briefly here and then will elaborate on a few of them further down below.

C 1. The discrete solder columns can be formed right on the spot starting out with a solder ball and then shaping it during the reflow process to the desired shape of the flat with elongated cross section oriented column. See further below .

C 2. We could also preform the solder column as a generally flattened with elongated cross section column and hold it in the proper orientation by a carrier wafer or a fixture and then attach it to the package first and then to the substrate next. An example would be to take the CCMD solder columns flatten them under a press or the like so that each would have an oblong or elongated cross section but with the correct length then insert each flattened column into a carrier wafer such that each column would face the central thermal center of the package assembly. See also Ref5 .

C 3. We could also attach such flattened oriented solder columns with elongated cross section to both the package and substrate in one operation if we use something like the soluble disappearing carrier wafer. See also Ref3 Ref5 .

C 4. We could also use an appropriate conductive adhesive instead of the solder to attach the flattened oriented columns to the package and then to the substrate. Again this can be done in two steps or in one step as explained above.

C 5. We could grow the solder columns on the chip or the package by any of the various methods known in the industry. We just have to make sure that the cross section of the columns is flattened with oblong or elongated cross section and that the columns are oriented so that the wide surface of the columns faces the thermal center or the short axis of the column cross section is in line with the respective thermal deformation ray as per this invention.

If we have a point of the package fixed in space then that point will act as the anchor and all the thermal deformations will start or originate from that point. Hence we can say that this fixation point is acting also as the new effective thermal fixation point which would be equivalent to the thermal center . In such a case all the thermal deformation rays will then be emanating from this fixation point . Again this is in accordance with the earlier definitions.

According to this present invention all the leads legs joints will have to be facing this thermal center or the thermal fixation point.

I have added another line inside each of the solder pads. This is a line that is perpendicular to each thermal deformation ray which starts at the thermal center or the thermal fixation center of the package and proceeds to each individual pad. This new line would give us the preferred direction of bending axis of each respective solder column or leg or lead if we want to minimize the bending stresses on that column during the thermal expansion and contraction of the assembly. We will refer to this line as the preferred bending line or simply the bending line for its respective pad . DEFINITION . We can notice and appreciate that the direction of the bending line inside each solder pad is different than that of the adjacent ones because the direction of the thermal deformation rays changes continuously as we go from one pad to the next to the next etc.

Inside each solder pad there are two additional lines. They are parallel to the bending line one on either side of it and at a certain distance from it. These two lines will define the shape of the new rectangular solder pads according to this invention.

Now if we build our solder columns on top of each of these pads such that the columns would generally have a cross section generally similar to these solder pads and would be oriented in the same respective direction of each individual pad then the new solder columns would have minimum bending stresses applied on them during any relative motion between the package and the substrate for example during a thermal cycling situation.

All the pads are located along their standard conventional orthogonal lines i.e. the center point of each pad is on a line which is parallel to the sides or the center lines of the package and at the proper pitch etc. These locations are exactly as specified by JEDEC or by any other standards for standard conventional BGAs. The only difference is the shape of the pads and their orientations.

However the pads themselves are not as specified for standard conventional pads. They are according to this present invention i.e. they are rectangular in shape and they are oriented such that their bending line is perpendicular to the thermal deformation ray which starts at the thermal center of the package and goes through the center point of each respective individual pad.

There is a number of ways or methods for making these oriented generally rectangular solder columns. Some are well know to the industry and some are new and novel as per this invention.

There are several ways to manufacture the above embodiments. In many cases several methods can be applicable to the different embodiments. I will show these methods here below.

In we see that we have two components LCCC s that we want to join together. The lower one has already the solder balls attached to the oriented rectangular pads. The top LCCC has the solder pads also rectangular in shape and oriented as proposed by this invention in other words they match their respective counterparts on the lower device both in shape and in orientation. The arrow in the figure indicates that we will move the top package on top of the bottom one.

We see along one side of the package a set of dimension lines marked A B and C . These indicate the distance or height or gap between the two devices. The dimension or gap A indicates the gap when the top package is sitting on top of the solder balls. When the solder balls are molten then we would by some means that will be explained later pull the top package a little bit away from the bottom package to increase the gap between them to the gap marked B . This would change the shape of the solder joint from spherical to rectangular. This will reduce the stresses on the solder joints. If we want to reduce the stresses on the joints even more we would then pull the packages further apart to make the gap equal to C or close to it. Although this would make the total assembly slightly larger higher thicker it would reduce the stresses in the solder joints and improve the life expectancy of the assembly. When we go from gap B to gap C the solder columns will change in shape from a uniform rectangular column to a starved column shape as we talked about earlier in the BACKGROUND Section and as will be shown in the following figures.

Such starved columns can be produced this way i.e. directly on a BGA or a chip or any such device by a progressive process of repeated masking and deposition or screen printing as will be explained later.

All the figures in are shown in the wire form format. In other words the hidden lines have not been removed. shows the same figures shown in but with the hidden lines removed.

In essence we start with solder balls that have a core of special material which is coated with a relatively thin layer of solder. The core can be made of a solder alloy that has a higher melting temperature or can be made of copper or even a glass sphere or the like. We ll refer to such solder balls as cored solder balls.

We place such cored solder balls on the pads of the package or of the substrate as in . The size of the core and the amount of meltable solder on top of the core have to be calculated so as to accomplish the desired end results as explained below. The size of the core will be such that it will provide the proper height of the resulting end solder joint and the size of the ball will be chosen such that the amount of solder will not be enough to create a fat solder joint. It would rather give us the desired starved joint.

The end result is that when we place the mating package on top of another package or substrate as in and reflow then the solder would melt and will start to wet both the top and bottom pads. The non meltable core would either float in the middle of the joint or fall to the bottom or even may rise to the top depending on its specific gravity and that of the molten solder.

The solder will wet the pads. But the amount of solder would have been chosen such that there will not be enough solder to create a fat solder joint even with the presence of the core. It will wet the two pads and spread as much as possible over the whole surface of each pad but eventually the top package would drop and fall towards the bottom package and finally would come to rest on top of the cores as in . The cores will act as stops or stand offs and will control the spacing or gap between the two devices.

The end effect will be that we will have solder joints that have large pads or feet but with a narrower waist.

In either case the stand offs will have to have a total height that is slightly smaller than the diameter of the balls or the total height of the balls in case the balls are truncated. The reason is that the balls need to touch the pads and wet them before the stand offs take over.

Note The conical shape preform in looks like a prior art design covered by a patent issued to IBM or AT T but I don t remember the patent number. I think it was called solder cones . The cones were cast on the package.

Some stand offs or stops would be placed between the two devices to control the distance between them during the reflow process. The height of the stand off would be smaller shorter than the height of the preforms.

Let s say we have the preform attached to the top device pads and let s say that it is a BGA package. Sometimes such a package with columns sticking out from its bottom is referred to as a dead roach or simply a roach . It will also look very much like a Pin Grid Array Package PGAP except that the legs will be made out of those solder preforms.

We place the roached BGA on the PCB as in or B. I am showing only one preform and one stand off here just for clarity.

At this point in time i.e. before the reflow process the distance between the BGA and the PCB pads will be practically equal to the height of the preforms plus whatever non planarity that may beat the tips of the preforms. The pads themselves have their own thickness which will add to the total gap between the bodies of the BGA and the PCB.

When we start the reflow process the solder preforms will soften and start to melt. The bottom tips of the tallest preforms would be sitting on top of the PCB pads. If some preforms are slightly shorter due to manufacturing tolerances they will not be touching their respective PCB pads. In order to enhance the wetting we can apply some flux on the PCB pads or even some solder paste. This would help in connecting the preform to the pads and to transfer heat and in keeping the surfaces of the pads clean etc.

Once the taller preforms start to melt and the top BGA starts to move downwards due to its own weight or due to some external forces then these shorter preforms will reach their respective PCB pads and touch and wet.

I figured that one good way to explain the concept is to use some concrete dimensions as in the example shown in . I will use these abbreviations for the various dimensions which I have selected for this example 

Since we can easily assume that the volume of solder not solder paste will not change and since we have decided and determined that the volume of the end resulting Starved columns VS is 2.96E 06 inch cube then all the other volumes i.e. VP VC and VR will also equal that same volume. We will use this knowledge assumption fact to determine the three remaining unknown values i.e. HC HR and HP. For these calculations here we will assume that there are no solder fillets to affect our calculations.

In we will also assume that the pads are Circular and have a diameter DC of 0.025 inch hence a surface area of 4.91E 04 inch square.

When the preforms will melt each preform will try to wet all the surface of its respective pads and still tries to stay as one single lump of solder. The top BGA will drop and will create solder joints connecting each BGA pad to its corresponding PCB pad. These solder joints would have a similar shape as the pads but they would have a much shorter height HC than the preform s original height HP .

The volume of the solder in the solder joint VC is 2.96E 06 inch cube as discussed above. The area of its circular pad AC is 4.91E 04 inch square. Hence the height HC of this solder joint is VC AC 0.0060 inch.

Note that we are assuming that the circular solder joint will have straight vertical wall i.e. the joint is not fat or skinny and that there will be no fillets effect.

This means that for the same amount of solder that we need to create the 0.025 inch tall Starved column on a Rectangular pad that is 0.025 long by 0.010 wide we would get a solder joint height of only 0.006 inch if we had used a circular pad of 0.025 inch diameter.

In we will again assume that the pads are Rectangular and have a length LR of 0.025 inch and a width WR of 0.010 inch.

When the preforms will melt again each preform will try to wet all the surface of its respective pads and still tries to stay as one single lump of solder. The top BGA will drop and will create solder joints connecting each BGA pad to its corresponding PCB pad. These solder joints would have a similar shape as the pads but their height HR will be different.

The volume of the solder joint VR is still 2.96E 06 inch cube as discussed above. The area of its Rectangular pad AR is 2.50E 04 inch square. Hence the height HR of this solder joint is VR AR 0.0118 inch.

Note that we are again assuming that the Rectangular solder joint will have straight vertical wall i.e. the joint is not fat or skinny and again there is no fillets effect.

We will arrange to have the height of the stand offs to be equal to the height of the Starved columns plus the thickness of the solder pads on the BGA and the PCB. This is because the stand off will not be placed between the pads themselves but between the body of the BGA and the general surface of the PCB. If we assume that both groups of pads are 0.005 inch thick then the height of the stand offs should be HS 0.005 0.005 0.035 inch.

We have also decided to make the Preform with a diameter DP of 0.010 inch hence its cross section area AP is 7.85E 05 inch square.

And since we know that the volume VP of the Preform is equal to the volume VS of the Starved column which is 2.96E 06 inch cube we can now calculate the height HP of the Preform. HP will be VP AP 0.377 inch.

This means that the distance between the body of the BGA and the general body of the PCB would be 0.0377 0.005 0.005 0.0477 inch. This gives us the height of the Stand Off which then should be 0.0477 inch.

According to all the above calculations we can see that during the reflow process the Preforms will collapse through a distance 0.0377 0.0250 0.0127 inch.

A similar situation would occur if the preforms were made of different shapes but still with the same volume. For example the preforms can have a conical shape as in or E. As long as the volume is still equal to VP i.e. the volume of the cylindrical preform described above and all other parameters stay the same then we should end up with the same height for the solder joints. Conical preforms can be cast directly on the BGA more easily than if we would want to attach cylindrical preforms to the same package.

A variation to the above method is to start with solder paste that we would apply to one device or to both. Ideally the paste would be shaped as a cone so that the volume amount of solder would be limited. We would have stops or stand offs as in . This leads us in a way into the next alternative. See Alternative 3 for the reason of having cones i.e. tall shapes but with limited volume.

The above examples using the preforms and the standoffs on circular pads or even on square pads i.e. on standard conventional packages and pads can also be used in the industry simply to provide the assemblies with flex joints and thus enhance their reliability and extend their operating life compared with the normal cases of having short stubby solder joints.

We could extend this same thinking and apply it to other shapes of pads. For example the pads could be rectangular or elliptical or oblong or elongated in any desirable fashion.

Then the pads could also be oriented as per the present invention to take advantage of the additional expected benefits.

We can also use shape memory materials e.g. shape memory plastic like the one used by Raychem Corporation now TYCO to make their heat shrink tubing. We could also use shape memory metals again used by Raychem. These metals include Tinel which is a trade name for an alloy of Titanium Nickel or Betalloy which is a trade name for a shape memory Copper Alloy. Betalloy is also used to make eyeglasses frames which can be deformed at will and when they get placed under a hot water faucet and the hot water hits them they jump back to their original shape.

We can use such shape memory materials plastics or metals to create the lifting devices means to increase the distance between the mating pads and to stretch the solder joints columns.

So give examples of such a lifting device. They show a frame of some sort which would have the desired lifting features. These could have a sort of a lip that would lodge between the package and the substrate. The lip would have been made originally with a certain thickness height. Then it would be cross linked to keep its original manufactured shape in memory. Then it would be compressed cold to make it thinner at room temperature. Then it would be place between the substrate and the package. When the stack gets in the oven to reflow the solder the solder would melt and attach to both the substrate and the package and then at the right time and or temperature the lip would activate and remember its original shape and thickness so it would lift the package increasing the gap between the package and the substrate thus stretching the solder columns to their desired shape.

We could also activate the memory of the lifting elements by other means. For example using selective frequency lasers. We could use a laser with the proper frequency to melt and reflow the solder while the lifting elements are still dormant. When we know that the solder has molten and is attached to both the package and the substrate then we activate the laser with a different frequency which would then wake up the memory of the lift elements so that they would lift the package and increase the gap and thus stretch the columns to the desired height and shape.

The frame with the lift elements can be made to be removed after the soldering operation is completed. It could be made with some breakaway tabs to facilitate its removal. It could also be made out a material that could be dissolved and removed this way e.g. like the carrying wafer that was used with the CCMD. See Ref14 U.S. Pat. No. 4 655 382 invented by Geoffrey B. Wong et al. and who were members of the effort on that project. In this case we could have the lifting elements inserted in a similar dissolvable carrying wafer.

The lift elements could be made out of Betalloy or Tinel as mentioned above and could be incorporated in the frame or in any other contraption that is suitable.

The lifting could be done also by other means such as fixturing of any suitable shape or form as desired by the particular user or manufacturer.

Instead of using devices made of shape memory material to lift the top package say the BGA and to increase the gap between it and the lower PCB we can use a lifting elements made out of a material that has a relatively large TCE. We could for example use a foam material possibly closed cell foam which would expand at a considerably larger rate than the other components in the assembly. We would place such a lifting means let s just call it the foam between the BGA and the PCB where the foam would be much thinner than the height H . During the reflow the foam would expand but would still be smaller than the height H up to a certain point or rather up to a certain temperature. When the temperature reaches the liquidus temperature of the solder and the solder would melt totally then the thickness of the foam will be just about equal to the height H just a little thinner. So up to this temperature the foam has not done any lifting. Then when the temp exceed the melting temp of the solder and is in the reflow holding zone the foam will expand to a larger size and will lift the BGA and increase the gap to H and then to goes beyond to H as required.

Fill the solder with copper particle so that we can shape it into the required preform shapes like the LONG CONES or the TAPERED AND REST CYLINDRICAL COMPOSITE CONES etc.

Preforms will be TALL AND SLENDER Taller than the end height of the finished column. The volume of the preform will be the same as the volume of the finished column. But since the finished column will be large at the base of the BGA and of the PCB and May West at the center then for the same volume the height will be shorter.

During reflow of the tall slender preforms the BGA will fall or drop down until its stops at the correct height sitting on the stops which will control the ultimate height of the solder columns.

The molten solder will stay sticking to the solder pads on the PCB as well as on the BGA and will have a cross section that will match pretty closely the shape of the respective contact pads at each end of the solder joint.

The center portion between the two pads will get thinner and will form an hour glass shape or a May West waist shape.

By controlling the volume of the original solder ball and the areas of the contact pads of the PCB and of the BGA and also the ultimate height of the stretched solder column we can calculate pretty close enough the new height of the solder joint. We will call this stretched or starved solder column.

We can have an element placed between the BGA and the PCB which would expand in its height so that the BGA gets lifter AFTER THE SOLDER HAS MOLTEN AND HAS ATTACHED ITSELF TO THE CONTACT PADS OF BOTH THE BGA AND THE PCB.

The element can be made of expandable plastic either using SHAPE MEMORY Features or using a foam plastic with certain air or other material.

The solder used for these assemblies could also be filled solder e.g. solder mixed with particles of copper or the like to make it stick together and hold its shape better and longer than regular unfilled solder. Such filled solder is already in the prior art and I have known it and encountered it since 1980 when I was working on my CCMD. However I could not find it when I did a patent search recently.

We could also use conductive adhesives to create and or to attach these oriented rectangular columns or starved columns with or without solder or with or without filled solder.

We could also start with the same preform material column wire stock that I had used for the CCMD flatten it and insert it into carrier wafer which have oriented holes and where the flattened columns will be properly oriented and then use that to mount packages on substrates.

The left bottom figure sketch in shows one way to grow a uniform rectangular solder column using for example the masking and deposition techniques used for the manufacturing of chips or multilayer boards or simply using solder masks and the like.

We can also envision that by using multiple repeated steps of masking and deposition we can shape the solder columns to have already from the start the desired end shape of the hour glass or the Mae West form or a shape approximately close enough to it. This can easily be accomplished say by starting a first masking and deposition step where the lower one third of the column would be large then we would repeat the masking and deposition step but with a narrower cross section for the solder column and then finally the third masking and deposition step would have again a large cross section for the solder column. This would produce a solder column that has three sizes of cross sections step wise or step shape profile. During the reflow the shape will change from a step shape profile to a rather smooth curve profile due to the high surface tension of the solder. More than three steps could be used if necessary.

The right bottom figure shows a cross section of the figure on the left but shows also the package sitting on top of the grown solder column and also we could add some solder cream that could screen printed so as to facilitate the wetting of the solder column to the pads on the substrate and or package.

Once these packages and substrates with oriented pads become popular and used on the market then we will need sockets that can handle such packages and can sit and be mounted on such substrates. It is easy to make such sockets and connectors. Simply install the contact springs in a way that would match the orientation of the pads et voila . Such sockets and connectors are part of this invention as well and I would like to claim them as well.

Based on the above I am proposing to create solder columns that have a cross section that is more elongated than circular and where the columns are oriented such that their wider surface would be facing the thermal center of the package or of the anticipated assembly.

Another basis for this invention is the fact that a solder joint in general usually follow the shape of the solder pads it is attached to.

For that reason I propose to shape the solder pads so as to be conducive to creating such solder joints.

For example if the column is desired to have a roughly rectangular cross section then the solder pad should also have roughly a rectangular shape.

The effect of the shape of the solder pad on the shape of the column cross section does fade away as we move away farther from the pad along the solder column length height.

For example if we start with square solder pads on both the package and the substrate which will be joined together by a solder joint then the following would be expected.

If the space between the two pads is very narrow short height or short gap or space between the pads then the solder joint will have practically the same shape as the two solder pads i.e. square assuming the proper volume of solder is used.

If the solder volume is too large for the space available the n the solder would bulge out and may even overflow. If allowed to float then the joint may become higher taller as well.

If the volume is too small and if the height space is allowed to float then the thickness height of the joint would be smaller.

If the proper volume is provided and if the two pads were pulled apart a certain distance then we would be forming a column . The shape of the column would depend on the ratio of H S where H is the Height and S is the Side of the square.

For a small H S the cross section of the column would be relatively uniform as a square throughout its whole height or length of the column.

If H S get larger then the column cross section near the pads would still be square and then the further away we go away from the pads towards the mid height of the column the cross section of the column will start to get more rounded at the corners or rather filleted until at a certain point or height it may reach a circular shape rather than a square.

If we increase the height to a relatively small medium height then the joint will be exactly rectangular at base pads and the farther we get away from the pads the more rounded filleted the corners of the rectangle and when the column gets pretty tall then at the center of the column close to its mid height i.e. at mid distance between the pads we would get an ellipse and for even taller columns yet we may even get a circular cross section at the mid height of the column.

All the above is assuming that the solder would not separate and cut off into two separate individual portions where one portion would stick adhere to the lower pad and the other portion would stick adhere to the upper pad or it may even separate totally from the top pad and the whole amount of solder would sit on top of the lower pad.

I had solved this problem as seen in two of my previous inventions. Please see Ref15. U.S. Pat. No. 4 664 309 dated May 12 1987 entitled CHIP MOUNTING DEVICE and Ref16. U.S. Pat. No. 4 705 205 dated Nov. 10 1987 entitled CHIP CARRIER MOUNTING DEVICE . There I have supported the solder by wrapping a thin narrow band ribbon of copper tape around the solder column to keep its columnar shape.

If we find it necessary in certain cases here then we can use a similar approach for this present invention.

There is a difference however. In the CCMD case the height of the columns were staying practically constant. In this present invention the columns change their height as described herein.

We can absorb the difference i.e. the change in height of the columns by using a thin wire to wrap around the solder column in such a way that the wire would be more flexible than the ribbon tape. The thin wire preferably with a round cross section instead of the rectangular cross section of the ribbon would be more flexible and more receptive to allowing the column to compress or to stretch.

Another change that we can introduce over the CCMD is to flatten the CCMD columns. The CCMD columns were made in a continuous shape like a continuous wire. We called it the columns wire stock or simply the wire stock . The wire stock was then cut to the proper length to create the preforms and then the preforms were inserted into fixtures sometimes we used dissolvable carrying wafer to be used for the assembly process.

First we need to flatten the wire stock. After the wire stock is formed using the thin wire instead of the ribbon we can run the wire stock between two rolls under pressure to flatten the wire stock.

Second when the wire stock is cut to the proper length of the individual preforms each preform would be oriented as per the present invention when it is inserted into the carrying fixture or the carrying wafer or when it is attached to the packages regardless of the method of attachment.

The term filled solder had been used in an old patent that I encountered around 1980 84 when I was working on the CCMD. That patent has included some copper particles into the solder homogeneously dispersed in the solder. I had wanted to use that approach myself as an alternate method of maintaining the shape of the solder columns but because of that prior art. I was told that I could not claim myself anymore. That prior art patent wanted to use that filled solder to close large gaps between copper plates or the like. Because of the copper filler the solder was supposed to maintain the shape given to it overcoming the high surface tension of the solder.

Regardless that patent is now in the public domain since it has been over 17 20 years since the time I encountered it.

So if we make oriented starved columns as per present invention and encounter cases where the regular solder does separate then we can use filled solder as described above to reduce or eliminate the separations. Filled solder would allow us to have taller starved columns without separation than if we were to use regular i.e. unfilled solder. Hence taller columns without separation.

First that the solder bump would have a rectangular or elongated cross section as implied by the rectangular opening in the mask shown in . shows a mask that could be used to create such a solder column bump with a rectangular or elongated cross section where the opening or aperture in the mask is rectangular or elongated as needed.

Second the fact that these solder bumps would be oriented as per the present invention. This means that the flat face of each solder bump or column for that matter would be facing the thermal center of the package or of the assembly or in other words the short axis of the solder bump cross section would be in the direction of the thermal deformation ray to that specific bump. Hence each opening or aperture in the mask should be oriented as needed to satisfy the requirements as per present invention.

This section of the specification relates to and covers the second group of products which includes LEADED packages.

Please refer also the GENERAL BACKGROUND section at the top of the present specification for additional remarks.

I had mentioned in my previous applications especially in Ref3 as well as in Ref5 that Oriented Leads or Columns can improve the life and reliability of plastic packages.

I had also shown a number of ways to achieve the desired designs and goals mostly grouped under two methods.

In the two step operation the leg blanks exit in an orthogonal direction from the package body i.e. in a direction that is normal or perpendicular to the body sides and or axed. So if we simply fold the leg blanks then the vertical parts of the legs will also be orthogonal hence not oriented as per invention. In order to get them oriented as required we have to add a twisting operation. This was all described at length in Ref3 and Ref5.

The other method was to use a flat leadframe with the leg blanks already oriented and radiating directly from the plastic body already in the proper direction i.e. exiting already on an angle from the package body i.e. on an angle to the package sides and axes. This allowed us to be able to simply fold the leg blanks and through this one single operation we were able to get the vertical part of the legs to be oriented as per recommendations of the invention.

This one single step folding operation compares favorably against the other alternative i.e. the fold and twist method. The reasons are that it is a one step operation only instead of a two step operation and where we need to also twist the legs to get them into the proper orientation . The second reason is that twisting if not done properly and carefully can overstress the plastic body or even the legs material itself.

In Ref3 and Ref5 I had mentioned and described the one step method and have shown some figures illustrating the proposed method. Many of those figures were pretty small and it may have been too difficult to recognize the fine details of the concept.

So in this present application I will show some figures with more details to make sure that the concept is well understood.

I will also show another one step method which could be considered a compromise between method A and B. I will call this method method C the Normal Oriented or Orthogonal Oriented Leg Blank with Fold Only method. I will briefly describe it here but I will further below show some figures to describe this method more fully in the section on DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION LEADED PRODUCTS .

In the two drawings attached to Ref6 FIGS. 1 2 I showed a proposed way to create oriented leads out a flat leadframe. I will call this method method C the Orthogonal Oriented or Normal Oriented Leg Blank with Fold Only method. Compare this with the two other methods mentioned earlier above.

Here the portion of the leadframe that would generate each individual leg of the package hereinafter referred to as leg blank would be coming out of or protruding from or exiting from the plastic body will be orthogonal i.e. perpendicular to the body s sides and centerlines the same way like the present conventional leadframes are made today in the industry. However the leg blanks would then be formed or rather blanked to radiate out in the proper desired oriented direction while they are still flat as shown in the two figures. The big difference is that the portion of the leg blanks coming out of the plastic body would be orthogonal instead of on an angle. This makes it easier to provide the dams that are necessary for the encapsulation or molding process and then later to cut off or trim the dams after the encapsulation or molding process is finished.

To enhance the reliability and to prolong the operating life of leaded packages by reducing the stresses on the packages body and also by reducing the stresses on the assemblies solder joints and solder pads between the tips of the gull wing legs of the packages and the substrates on which the packages are mounted.

In this present invention I will describe the third method of forming the legs of leaded packages i.e. Method C the Normal Oriented Leg Blank with Fold Only method.

I will also show some more examples of the second method which was described in Ref3 and Ref5 i.e. Method B One Step Method Oriented Leg Blank with Fold Only.

I will also show more figures describing the solder pads that would accept the proposed oriented leads especially the combination pads. These solder pads were also described in Ref3 and Ref5 but the present figures will give more details.

I will briefly review the drawings in that Ref5 which have some special relevance to the present specification.

Ref5 FIGS. 41 and 42 illustrate my definitions of Fold and Twist . Ref5 FIG. 41 B shows a Twist in a strip of sheet metal which started Flat and Ref5 FIG. 41 C shows a Fold in a similar strip of sheet metal. Ref5 FIG. 42 D shows a progression from Flat to Twist and then to Fold . Ref5 FIG. 42 E reverses the order and shows a progression from Flat to Fold to Twist .

Ref5 FIGS. 2 and 3 show a Prior Art package with standard conventional legs. The leg blanks exit or protrude from the package body in a perpendicular direction to the sides and to the centerlines of the package. I refer to this condition as an orthogonal direction or sometimes as a normal direction. The leg blanks are later folded to create the vertical parts of the legs or leg columns . No twisting of the leg material is involved here.

Ref5 FIGS. 12 and 13 show an example of standard conventional flat leadframe. They also show the leg blanks are laid out to be orthogonal i.e. perpendicular to the sides and centerlines of the expected body of the package.

Ref5 FIGS. 20 and 21 appear to have their leg blanks in an orthogonal direction as well. The two external leg blanks at either side of the central one are then folded at some angle to create the oriented legs as shown.

Ref5 FIG. 22 A shows the legs orthogonal and folded but FIG. 22 B shows the leg blanks oriented and folded.

Ref5 FIG. 23 C shows solder pads that are rectangular and oriented in line with the thermal deformation rays. I will refer to such pads as dedicated solder pads. See more explanation later below.

Ref5 FIG. 23 D shows solder pads that can accept both conventional gull wing legs as well as oriented legs. I will refer to such pads as combination solder pads or simply combo pads . See more explanation later below.

Ref5 FIG. 25 top view shows the legs protruding from the body in an orthogonal direction but bottom view shows them in a radial or rather oriented direction.

Ref5. FIG. 26 at first glance may look like Ref5. FIG. 21 but there is a difference. Here the two external leg blanks seem to exit already on an angle to the side of the package body. We can say that they are oriented already. The fold is orthogonal with the leg blank and at an angle to the package body.

Ref5 FIGS. 32 through 40 show oriented leg blanks. Such leadframes will be referred to as radial or rather oriented leadframes. We only need to fold each leg blank orthogonally to the direction of the leg blank itself and we would then get the vertical part of each leg column oriented properly as per present invention. We do not need to twist anything.

Ref5. FIGS. 32 33 35 67 and 39 show the leadframe in its flat condition. Ref5 FIGS. 34 36 38 and 40 after the leg blanks had been folded and automatically oriented.

Ref6 FIG. 1 shows a flat leadframe where the leg blanks exit or protrude orthogonally but then they curve around while still in the flat leadframe condition so that the following part of the leg blank which would generate the vertical part of the legs becomes oriented as required by the present invention. I will refer to that portion of the leg blank that curves around as the neck of the leg blank. The included angle of each neck is different for each leg.

When we fold the leg blank orthogonally at the outer end of the neck then the resulting vertical portion of the legs will automatically be oriented properly as per present invention.

Since each leg is supposed to be oriented at some respective proper angle at its own respective angle with respect to the body s sides or centerlines then the included angle of each neck will also be different for the different legs to suit the requirements as per present invention.

Ref6. FIG. 2 shows the leg blanks shown in Ref6. FIG. 1 but after they have been folded after each individual neck. We can see that the vertical part of each leg is oriented properly as per present invention.

I have used a standard conventional package as a model for my example. It is a TSSOP package. JEDEC Joint Electronic Device Engineering Industry Development Association defines TSSOP as Thin Shrink Small Outline Package . I have used the package with twenty eight 63 legs i.e. seven 7 legs per quadrant.

This is just a model to demonstrate the concepts. The same concepts do apply to any other package that has leads legs regardless of size of package number of legs or whether the leads are on only two sides of the package or on all four sides etc.

FIG. 36 shows the TSSOP Prior Art package complete with body and legs and ready to be assembled on a PCB or the like.

FIG. 37 shows the leadframe of the above package without the plastic body or encapsulation. The leadframe is shown as if it has already gone through the manufacturing steps i.e. encapsulation de damming trimming sizing and folding.

FIG. 38 shows a 3 D view of the whole leadframe but in the flat condition. This is the leadframe for only one package. Usually there are a number of such leadframes all in a row but I am showing only one leadframe for one package only here.

FIG. 40 shows the same leadframe again but it also shows the locations of the solder pads on the PCB which will accept the tips of the package legs and get soldered to them.

FIG. 42 shows the same leadframe shown in FIG. 41 but after cutting or sizing the leg blanks to the proper length so that they would form the gull wing tips of the legs.

FIGS. 43 and 44 show 3 D views of the package with the gull wing tips of the legs sitting on top of the solder pads. These are the standard conventional solder pads.

Now I will describe a set of figures showing a leadframe according to method B the one stop method of using oriented leg blanks . See Background section.

Here the leg blanks protrude from or exit the package body on an angle with respect to the sides and centerlines of the package body. This permits that one folding operation would form the legs in the proper orientation.

Such an approach had already been described in Ref5. See FIGS. 32 through 40. The following figures duplicate the concepts shown in those earlier figures and show the concepts as applied to a real life model.

Note that the folding of the legs could be done at the same time as the de damming and the sizing trimming operations. This is optional.

Note also that the folding of each leg would have to be at the proper orientation as per present invention.

Finally note also that up to this point the package is still attached to the carrier strip. They will be separated from each other afterwards.

Once the package has been formed as shown in through B and C then we can mount the package on a PCB or the like by soldering the tips of the gull wing legs to some solder pads.

There are several ways that we can use to arrive to the shape of these combo pads. I will not go into all these details here because it can take too much time. I will be happy to present the process to the Examiner if desired. There are at least two main criteria to try to satisfy when designing such combo pads. First try to provide the largest surface possible to be soldered to the corresponding foot of the mating device with at least enough surface for good solder fillets. This however has to be tempered by the available space on the PCB. Second try to make sure that there are proper clearances between all adjacent pads and or adjacent features on the PCB to make sure that there will not be any electrical shorts between these features and or the pads themselves.

To make it easy to visualize I have shown only one pad position at a time. For example shows the first pad above the short centerline of the package. On top of this pad I have shown the corresponding leg of a standard package as well as the corresponding leg of an oriented package. Similarly shows the second pad above the centerline together with the two corresponding legs from a standard package and an oriented package. Again shows the third pad and the two corresponding legs etc. until which shows the seventh pad and its two corresponding legs.

The following group of figures shows a new embodiment which has not been shown previously except in Ref6 FIGS. 1 and 2. The following figures will simply clarify the embodiment represented by these two above figures showing more details thereof.

In the BACKGROUND section I had mentioned three alternative methods to achieve our objectives. Methods A B and C.

In the two drawings attached to Ref6 FIGS. 1 2 I had shown a proposed way to create oriented leads out a flat leadframe. I will call this method method C the Orthogonal Oriented or Normal Oriented Leg Blank with Fold Only method. Compare this with the two other methods i.e. Methods A and B mentioned earlier in the Background section.

In this method C the portion of the leadframe that would generate each individual leg of the package hereinafter referred to as leg blank would be coming out of or protruding from or exiting from the plastic body will be orthogonal i.e. perpendicular to the body s sides and centerlines the same way like the present conventional leadframes are made today in the industry. However the leg blanks would then be formed or rather blanked to radiate out in the proper desired oriented direction while they are still flat as shown in the two figures. The big difference between this method and method B is that the portion of the leg blanks coming out of the plastic body would be orthogonal instead of on an angle. This makes it easier to provide the dams that are necessary for the encapsulation or molding process and then later to cut off or trim the dams after the encapsulation or molding process is finished.

The major difference between the embodiment 2 and the previous one is the way the leg blanks are formed or rather blanked .

There is another difference also between this following group of figures and the earlier ones. It is the ending or termination of the legs. The earlier figures showed the legs endings shaped in a gull wings form so that they can be surface mounted to pads on a PCB. In the second group of figures the legs are terminated with solder tails which would be inserted into through holes in a PCB for clinching and or soldering. Both endings can be used in either of the two embodiments. I chose one ending termination for one embodiment and another ending termination for the second just for illustration purposes.

These four figures show that all the legs first protrude out from the package body in an orthogonal direction i.e. perpendicular or normal to the body s sides and long centerline. We will refer to that portion of the legs as the base . See . However after a certain distance along the base in that orthogonal direction we see a neck in each leg. The neck of each leg in any one quadrant is different than the necks in the adjacent legs. The neck encompasses a certain included angle . The neck ends up at a point where the leg blank becomes straight again. We will refer to the first portion of this straight run as the shoulder . Then the leg blank is folded to create the vertical portion of the leg. The portion that is folded will be referred to as the fold . The subsequent vertical portion consists of at least the two following portions. First the column and then the solder tail . The shoulder makes a certain angle with respect to the long axis of the package body.
