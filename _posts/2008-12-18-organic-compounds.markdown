This application claims priority to E.P. Application Serial No. 07150228.0 filed 20 Dec. 2007 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The present invention relates to 2 carboxamide cycloamino urea derivatives as new phosphatidylinositol P1 3 kinase inhibitor compounds their pharmaceutically acceptable salts prodrugs thereof and processes for their production. This invention also relates to compositions of these compounds either alone or in combination with at least one additional therapeutic agent and optionally in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. This invention still further relates to methods of use of these compounds either alone or in combination with at least one additional therapeutic agent in the prophylaxis or treatment of a number of diseases in particular those mediated by one or more of abnormal activity of growth factors receptor tyrosine kinases protein serine heroine kinases G protein coupled receptors and phospholipid kinases and phosphatases.

Phosphatidylinositol 3 kinases PI3Ks comprise a family of lipid kinases that catalyze the transfer of phosphate to the D 3 position of inositol lipids to produce phosphoinositol 3 phosphate PIP phosphoinositol 3 4 diphosphate PIP and phosphoinositol 3 4 5 triphosphate PIP that in turn act as second messengers in signaling cascades by docking proteins containing pleckstrin homology FYVE Phox and other phospholipid binding domains into a variety of signaling complexes often at the plasma membrane Vanhaesebroeck et al. 70 535 2001 Katso et al. . 17 615 2001 . Of the two Class 1 PI3Ks Class 1A PI3Ks are heterodimers composed of a catalytic p110 subunit isoforms constitutively associated with a regulatory subunit that can be p85 p55 p50 p85 or p55 . The Class 1B sub class has one family member a heterodimer composed of a catalytic p110 subunit associated with one of two regulatory subunits p101 or p84 Fruman et al. . 67 481 1998 Suire et al. . 15 566 2005 . The modular domains of the p85 55 50 subunits include Src Homology SH2 domains that bind phosphotyrosine residues in a specific sequence context on activated receptor and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases resulting in activation and localization of Class 1A PI3Ks. Class 1B PI3K is activated directly by G protein coupled receptors that bind a diverse repertoire of peptide and non peptide ligands Stephens et al. 89 105 1997 Katso et al. . 17 615 675 2001 . Consequently the resultant phospholipid products of class I PI3K link upstream receptors with downstream cellular activities including proliferation survival chemotaxis cellular trafficking motility metabolism inflammatory and allergic responses transcription and translation Cantley et al. 64 281 1991 Escobedo and Williams 335 85 1988 Fantl et al. 69 413 1992 .

In many cases PIP2 and PIP3 recruit Akt the product of the human homologue of the viral oncogene v Akt to the plasma membrane where it acts as a nodal point for many intracellular signaling pathways important for growth and survival Fantl et al. 69 413 423 1992 Bader et al. 5 921 2005 Vivanco and Sawyer 2 489 2002 . Aberrant regulation of PI3K which often increases survival through Akt activation is one of the most prevalent events in human cancer and has been shown to occur at multiple levels. The tumor suppressor gene PTEN which dephosphorylates phosphoinositides at the 3 position of the inositol ring and in so doing antagonizes PI3K activity is functionally deleted in a variety of tumors. In other tumors the genes for the p110 isoform PIK3CA and for Akt are amplified and increased protein expression of their gene products has been demonstrated in several human cancers. Furthermore mutations and translocation of p85 that serve to up regulate the p85 p110 complex have been described in human cancers. Finally somatic missense mutations in PIK3CA that activate downstream signaling pathways have been described at significant frequencies in a wide diversity of human cancers Kang et al. 102 802 2005 Samuels et al. 304 554 2004 Samuels et al. 7 561 573 2005 . These observations show that deregulation of phosphoinositol 3 kinase and the upstream and downstream components of this signaling pathway is one of the most common deregulations associated with human cancers and proliferative diseases Parsons et al. 436 792 2005 Hennessey at el. 4 988 1004 2005 .

In view of the above inhibitors of PI3Ks would be of particular value in the treatment of proliferative disease and other disorders.

WO2004 096797 discloses certain thiazole derivatives as inhibitors of PI3 kinase and their use as pharmaceutical.

WO 2005 021519 also discloses certain thiazole derivatives as inhibitors of PI3 kinase and their use as pharmaceutical.

It has now been found that the 2 carboxamide cycloamino urea derivatives of the formula I given below have advantageous pharmacological properties and inhibit for example the PI3 kinases phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase . In particular preferably these compounds show a high degree of selectivity for PI3K alpha with respect to beta and or delta and or gamma subtypes in the biochemical and or in the cellular assay. Hence the compounds of formula I are suitable for example to be used in the treatment of diseases depending on the PI3 kinase in particular PI3K alpha especially proliferative diseases such as tumor diseases leukaemias polycythemia vera essential thrombocythemia and myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia.

The invention may be more fully appreciated by reference to the following description including the following glossary of terms and the concluding examples. For the sake of brevity the disclosures of the publications cited in this specification are herein incorporated by reference. As used herein the terms including containing and comprising are used herein in their open non limiting sense.

Any formula given herein is intended to represent compounds having structures depicted by the structural formula as well as certain variations or forms. In particular compounds of any formula given herein may have asymmetric centers and therefore exist in different enantiomeric forms. If at least one asymmetrical carbon atom is present in a compound of the formula I such a compound may exist in optically active form or in the form of a mixture of optical isomers e.g. in the form of a racemic mixture. All optical isomers and their mixtures including the racemic mixtures are part of the present invention. Thus any given formula given herein is intended to represent a racemate one or more enantiomeric forms one or more diastereomeric forms one or more atropisomeric forms and mixtures thereof. Furthermore certain structures may exist as geometric isomers i.e. cis and trans isomers as tautomers or as atropisomers.

Any formula given herein is intended to represent hydrates solvates and polymorphs of such compounds and mixtures thereof.

Any formula given herein is also intended to represent unlabeled forms as well as isotopically labeled forms of the compounds. Isotopically labeled compounds have structures depicted by the formulas given herein except that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having a selected atomic mass or mass number. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen carbon nitrogen oxygen phosphorous fluorine and chlorine such as H H C C C N P P F S Cl I respectively. Various isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as H C and C are incorporated. Such isotopically labelled compounds are useful in metabolic studies preferably with C reaction kinetic studies with for example H or H detection or imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography PET or single photon emission computed tomography SPECT including drug or substrate tissue distribution assays or in radioactive treatment of patients. In particular an F or labeled compound may be particularly preferred for PET or SPECT studies. Further substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium i.e. H may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability for example increased in vivo half life or reduced dosage requirements. Isotopically labeled compounds of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the schemes or in the examples and preparations described below by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non isotopically labeled reagent.

Further substitution with heavier isotopes particularly deuterium i.e. H or D may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability for example increased in vivo half life or reduced dosage requirements or an improvement in therapeutic index. It is understood that deuterium in this context is regarded as a substituent in the compound of the formula I . The concentration of such a heavier isotope specifically deuterium may be defined by the isotopic enrichment factor. The term isotopic enrichment factor as used herein means the ratio between the isotopic abundance and the natural abundance of a specified isotope. If a substituent in a compound of this invention is denoted deuterium such compound has an isotopic enrichment factor for each designated deuterium atom of at least 3500 52.5 deuterium incorporation at each designated deuterium atom at least 4000 60 deuterium incorporation at least 4500 67.5 deuterium incorporation at least 5000 75 deuterium incorporation at least 5500 82.5 deuterium incorporation at least 6000 90 deuterium incorporation at least 6333.3 95 deuterium incorporation at least 6466.7 97 deuterium incorporation at least 6600 99 deuterium incorporation or at least 6633.3 99.5 deuterium incorporation . In the compounds of this invention any atom not specifically designated as a particular isotope is meant to represent any stable isotope of that atom. Unless otherwise stated when a position is designated specifically as H or hydrogen the position is understood to have hydrogen at its natural abundance isotopic composition. Accordingly in the compounds of this invention any atom specifically designated as a deuterium D is meant to represent deuterium for example in the ranges given above.

When referring to any formula given herein the selection of a particular moiety from a list of possible species for a specified variable is not intended to define the moiety for the variable appearing elsewhere. In other words where a variable appears more than once the choice of the species from a specified list is independent of the choice of the species for the same variable elsewhere in the formula where one or more up to all more general expressions in embodiments characterized as preferred above or below can be replaced with a more specific definition thus leading to a more preferred embodiment of the invention respectively .

 Salts which what is meant by or salts thereof or or a salt thereof can be present alone or in mixture with free compound of the formula I and are preferably pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Such salts are formed for example as acid addition salts preferably with organic or inorganic acids from compounds of formula I with a basic nitrogen atom especially the pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Suitable inorganic acids are for example halogen acids such as hydrochloric acid sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid. Suitable organic acids are e.g. carboxylic acids or sulfonic acids such as fumaric acid or methansulfonic acid. For isolation or purification purposes it is also possible to use pharmaceutically unacceptable salts for example picrates or perchlorates. For therapeutic use only pharmaceutically acceptable salts or free compounds are employed where applicable in the form of pharmaceutical preparations and these are therefore preferred. In view of the close relationship between the novel compounds in free form and those in the form of their salts including those salts that can be used as intermediates for example in the purification or identification of the novel compounds any reference to the free compounds hereinbefore and hereinafter is to be understood as referring also to the corresponding salts as appropriate and expedient.

Combination refers to either a fixed combination in one dosage unit form or a kit of parts for the combined administration where a compound of the formula I and a combination partner e.g. an other drug as explained below also referred to as therapeutic agent or co agent may be administered independently at the same time or separately within time intervals especially where these time intervals allow that the combination partners show a cooperative e.g. synergistic effect. The terms co administration or combined administration or the like as utilized herein are meant to encompass administration of the selected combination partner to a single subject in need thereof e.g. a patient and are intended to include treatment regimens in which the agents are not necessarily administered by the same route of administration or at the same time. The term pharmaceutical combination as used herein means a product that results from the mixing or combining of more than one active ingredient and includes both fixed and non fixed combinations of the active ingredients. The term fixed combination means that the active ingredients e.g. a compound of formula I and a combination partner are both administered to a patient simultaneously in the form of a single entity or dosage. The term non fixed combination means that the active ingredients e.g. a compound of formula I and a combination partner are both administered to a patient as separate entities either simultaneously concurrently or sequentially with no specific time limits wherein such administration provides therapeutically effective levels of the two compounds in the body of the patient. The latter also applies to cocktail therapy e.g. the administration of three or more active ingredients.

In preferred embodiments which are preferred independently collectively or in any combination or sub combination the invention relates to a compound of the formula I in free base form or in acid addition salt form wherein the substituents are as defined herein.

The following preferred features apply to any of the formulas herein in particular to formulae I IA IB IC and or I .

The Rmay be substituted at the 2 and or 3 and or 4 position of the nitrogen containing heterocycle to which it is attached e.g. the pyrrolidine ring of formula IA n 1 in formula I or the azetidine ring of formula IB n 0 in formula I . Most preferably when n 1 and m 1 the Rsubstituent is substituted at the 2 position of the pyrrolidine ring i.e. on the same carbon which is simultaneously substituted by the carboxamide group.

Typically when n 1 and m 2 the two Rsubstituents together form an alkandiyl or alkenediyl especially an alkandiyl most especially a methano group e.g. a 2 3 methano group . Alternatively when n 1 and m 2 the two Rgroups may be separate and substituted at the 2 and 4 positions respectively of the pyrrolidine ring or both at a single position i.e. geminal 2 2 3 3 or 4 4 especially 4 4 e.g. when Ris halo such as fluoro .

The invention further relates to pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs of a compound of formula I IA IB IC and or I .

The invention further relates to pharmaceutically acceptable metabolites of a compound of formula I IA IB IC and or I .

The invention relates especially to the compounds of the formula I IA IB IC and or I given in the Examples as well as the methods of manufacture described therein.

The present invention also relates to processes for the production of a compound of formula I IA IB IC and or I . In principle all known processes which convert two different amines into a corresponding urea derivative are suitable and may be applied by using the respective starting material.

Thus the invention in particular relates to a process which comprises reacting a compound of formula II

The process may be performed according to methods known in the art or as disclosed below in the Examples. For example a compound of formula II may be reacted with a compound of formula III in a solvent e.g. dimethylformamide in the presence of a base e.g. an organic amine e.g. triethylamine.

Where temperatures are given hereinbefore or hereinafter about has to be added as minor deviations from the numeric values given e.g. variations of 10 are tolerable. All reactions may take place in the presence of one or more diluents and or solvents. The starting materials may be used in equimolar amounts alternatively a compound may be used in excess e.g. to function as a solvent or to shift equilibrium or to generally accelerate reaction rates.

Reaction aids such as acids bases or catalysts may be added in suitable amounts as known in the field required by a reaction and in line with generally known procedures.

If one or more other functional groups for example carboxy hydroxy amino sulfhydryl or the like are or need to be protected in a starting material as described herein or any other precursor because they should not take part in the reaction or disturb the reaction these are such groups as are usually used in the synthesis of peptide compounds and also of cephalosporins and penicillins as well as nucleic acid derivatives and sugars. Protecting groups are such groups that are no longer present in the final compounds once they are removed while groups that remain as substituents are not protecting groups in the sense used here which are groups that are added at a starting material or intermediate stage and removed to obtain a final compound. Also in the case of conversions of a compound of the formula I IA IB IC and or I into a different compound of the formula I IA IB IC and or I protecting groups may be introduced and removed if useful or required.

The protecting groups may already be present in precursors and should protect the functional groups concerned against unwanted secondary reactions such as acylations etherifications esterifications oxidations solvolysis and similar reactions. It is a characteristic of protecting groups that they lend themselves readily i.e. without undesired secondary reactions to removal typically by acetolysis protonolysis solvolysis reduction photolysis or also by enzyme activity for example under conditions analogous to physiological conditions and that they are not present in the end products. The specialist knows or can easily establish which protecting groups are suitable with the reactions mentioned above and below.

The protection of such functional groups by such protecting groups the protecting groups themselves and their removal reactions are described for example in standard reference works such as J. F. W. McOmie Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry Plenum Press London and New York 1973 in T. W.

A compound of the formula I IA IB IC and or I may be converted into a different compound of the formula I IA IB IC and or I .

In a compound of the formula I IA IB IC and or I wherein Rrepresents fluoromethyl or hydroxymethyl such compound may be obtained by converting the corresponding chlorine derivative into the hydroxy or fluoro compound. Such reactions are known and referred to as substitution reactions. This conversion may take place at the step of the starting material of formula IIIA or B or by converting a corresponding compound of formula I IA IB IC and or I .

In a compound of the formula I IA IB IC and or I wherein a substituent carries an amino or amino C C alkyl substituent the amino can be converted into acylamino e.g. C C alkanoylamino or C C alkanesulfonylamino by reaction with a corresponding C Cal kanoylhalogenide or C C alkanesulfonylhalogenide e.g. a corresponding chloride in the presence of a tertiary nitrogen base such as triethylamine or pyridine in the absence or presence of an appropriate solvent such a methylene chloride for example at temperatures in the range from 20 to 50 C. e.g. at about room temperature.

In a compound of the formula I IA IB IC and or I wherein a substituent carries a cyano substituent the cyano may be converted to an aminomethyl group e.g. by hydrogenation in the presence of an appropriate metal catalyst such as Raney Nickel or Raney Cobalt in an appropriate solvent e.g. a lower alkanol such as methanol and or ethanol for example at temperatures in the range from 20 to 50 C. e.g. at about room temperature.

Salts of a compound of formula I IA IB IC and or I with a salt forming group may be prepared in a manner known per se. Acid addition salts of compounds of formula I IA IB IC and or I may thus be obtained by treatment with an acid or with a suitable anion exchange reagent. A salt with two acid molecules for example a dihalogenide of a compound of formula I IA IB IC and or I may also be converted into a salt with one acid molecule per compound for example a monohalogenide this may be done by heating to a melt or for example by heating as a solid under a high vacuum at elevated temperature for example from 130 to 170 C. one molecule of the acid being expelled per molecule of a compound of formula I IA IB IC and or I . Salts can usually be converted to free compounds e.g. by treating with suitable basic compounds for example with alkali metal carbonates alkali metal hydrogencarbonates or alkali metal hydroxides typically potassium carbonate or sodium hydroxide.

Stereoisomeric mixtures e.g. mixtures of diastereomers can be separated into their corresponding isomers in a manner known per se by means of suitable separation methods. Diastereomeric mixtures for example may be separated into their individual diastereomers by means of fractionated crystallization chromatography solvent distribution and similar procedures. This separation may take place either at the level of a starting compound or in a compound of formula I IA IB IC and or I itself. Enantiomers may be separated through the formation of diastereomeric salts for example by salt formation with an enantiomer pure chiral acid or by means of chromatography for example by HPLC using chromatographic substrates with chiral ligands.

The compounds of formula I IA IB IC and or I as disclosed herein are useful as pharmaceuticals. The invention therefore relates in one embodiment to compositions for human or veterinary use where inhibition of PI3K is indicated.

In one embodiment the invention relates to the treatment of cellular proliferative diseases such as tumor and or cancerous cell growth mediated by PI3K. In particular the compounds are useful in the treatment of human or animal e.g. murine cancers including for example lung and bronchus prostate breast pancreas colon and rectum thyroid liver and intrahepatic bile duct hepatocellular gastric glioma glioblastoma endometrial melanoma kidney and renal pelvis urinary bladder uterine corpus uterine cervix ovary multiple myeloma esophagus acute myelogenous leukemia chronic myelogenous leukemia lymphocytic leukemia myeloid leukemia brain oral cavity and pharynx larynx small intestine non Hodgkin lymphoma melanoma and villous colon adenoma.

In other embodiments the PI3K mediated condition or disorder is selected from the group consisting of asthma COPD ARDS Loffler s syndrome eosinophilic pneumonia parasitic in particular metazoan infestation including tropical eosinophilia bronchopulmonary aspergillosis polyarteritis nodosa including Churg Strauss syndrome eosinophilic granuloma eosinophil related disorders affecting the airways occasioned by drug reaction psoriasis contact dermatitis atopic dermatitis alopecia areata erythema multiforme dermatitis herpetiformis vitiligo hypersensitivity angiitis urticaria bullous pemphigoid lupus erythematosus pemphisus epidermolysis bullosa acquisita autoimmune haematogical disorders e.g. haemolytic anaemia aplastic anaemia pure red cell anaemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenia systemic lupus erythematosus polychondritis Wegener granulomatosis dermatomyositis chronic active hepatitis myasthenia gravis Steven Johnson syndrome idiopathic sprue autoimmune inflammatory bowel disease e.g. ulcerative colitis and Crohn s disease endocrine opthalmopathy Grave s disease sarcoidosis alveolitis chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis multiple sclerosis primary biliary cirrhosis uveitis anterior and posterior interstitial lung fibrosis psoriatic arthritis glomerulonephritis cardiovascular diseases atherosclerosis hypertension deep venous thrombosis stroke myocardial infarction unstable angina thromboembolism pulmonary embolism thrombolytic diseases acute arterial ischemia peripheral thrombotic occlusions and coronary artery disease reperfusion injuries retinopathy such as diabetic retinopathy or hyperbaric oxygen induced retinopathy and conditions characterized by elevated intraocular pressure or secretion of ocular aqueous humor such as glaucoma.

An indicated daily dosage in the larger mammal e.g. humans is in the range from about 0.5 mg to about 1 g conveniently administered for example in divided doses up to four times a day or in retard form. Suitable unit dosage forms for oral administration comprise from ca. 0.1 to 500 mg active ingredient.

The compounds of formula I IA IB IC and or I may be administered by any conventional route in particular enterally e.g. orally e.g. in the form of tablets or capsules or parenterally e.g. in the form of injectable solutions or suspensions topically e.g. in the form of lotions gels ointments or creams by inhalation intranasally or in a suppository form.

The compounds of formula I IA IB IC and or I may be administered in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form e.g. as indicated above. Such salts may be prepared in conventional manner and exhibit the same order of activity as the free compounds.

PI3K serves as a second messenger node that integrates parallel signaling pathways evidence is emerging that the combination of a PI3K inhibitor with inhibitors of other pathways will be useful in treating cancer and proliferative diseases in humans.

Approximately 20 30 of human breast cancers overexpress Her 2 neu ErbB2 the target for the drug trastuzumab. Although trastuzumab has demonstrated durable responses in some patients expressing Her2 neu ErbB2 only a subset of these patients respond. Recent work has indicated that this limited response rate can be substantially improved by the combination of trastuzumab with inhibitors of PI3K or the PI3K AKT pathway Chan et al. Breast Can. Res. Treat. 91 187 2005 Woods Ignatoski et al. Brit. J. Cancer 82 666 2000 Nagata et al. Cancer Cell 6 117 2004 .

A variety of human malignancies express activating mutations or increased levels of Her1 EGFR and a number of antibody and small molecule inhibitors have been developed against this receptor tyrosine kinase including tarceva gefitinib and erbitux. However while EGFR inhibitors demonstrate anti tumor activity in certain human tumors e.g. NSCLC they fail to increase overall patient survival in all patients with EGFR expressing tumors. This may be rationalized by the fact that many downstream targets of Her1 EGFR are mutated or deregulated at high frequencies in a variety of malignancies including the PI3K Akt pathway. For example gefitinib inhibits the growth of an adenocarcinoma cell line in in vitro assays. Nonetheless sub clones of these cell lines can be selected that are resistant to gefitinib that demonstrate increased activation of the PI3 Akt pathway. Down regulation or inhibition of this pathway renders the resistant sub clones sensitive to gefitinib Kokubo et al. Brit. J. Cancer 92 1711 2005 . Furthermore in an in vitro model of breast cancer with a cell line that harbors a PTEN mutation and over expresses EGFR inhibition of both the PI3K Akt pathway and EGFR produced a synergistic effect She et al. Cancer Cell 8 287 297 2005 . These results indicate that the combination of gefitinib and PI3K Akt pathway inhibitors would be an attractive therapeutic strategy in cancer.

The combination of AEE778 an inhibitor of Her 2 neu ErbB2 VEGFR and EGFR and RAD001 an inhibitor of mTOR a downstream target of Akt produced greater combined efficacy that either agent alone in a glioblastoma xenograft model Goudar et al. Mol. Cancer. Ther. 4 101 112 2005 .

Anti estrogens such as tamoxifen inhibit breast cancer growth through induction of cell cycle arrest that requires the action of the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip. Recently it has been shown that activation of the Ras Raf MAP Kinase pathway alters the phosphorylation status of p27Kip such that its inhibitory activity in arresting the cell cycle is attenuated thereby contributing to anti estrogen resistance Donovan et al J. Biol. Chem. 276 40888 2001 . As reported by Donovan et al. inhibition of MAPK signaling through treatment with MEK inhibitor reversed the aberrant phosphorylation status of p27 in hormone refractory breast cancer cell lines and in so doing restored hormone sensitivity. Similarly phosphorylation of p27Kip by Akt also abrogates its role to arrest the cell cycle Viglietto et al. Nat Med. 8 1145 2002 .

Accordingly in a further aspect the compounds of formulas I IA IB IC and or I are used in the treatment of hormone dependent cancers such as breast and prostate cancers. By this use it is aimed to reverse hormone resistance commonly seen in these cancers with conventional anticancer agents.

In hematological cancers such as chronic myelogenous leukemia CML chromosomal translocation is responsible for the constitutively activated BCR AbI tyrosine kinase. The afflicted patients are responsive to imatinib a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor as a result of inhibition of AbI kinase activity. However many patients with advanced stage disease respond to imatinib initially but then relapse later due to resistance conferring mutations in the AbI kinase domain. In vitro studies have demonstrated that BCR Ab1 employs the Ras Raf kinase pathway to elicit its effects. In addition inhibiting more than one kinase in the same pathway provides additional protection against resistance conferring mutations.

Accordingly in another aspect the compounds of formulas I IA IB IC and or I are used in combination with at least one additional agent selected from the group of kinase inhibitors such as Gleevec in the treatment of hematological cancers such as chronic myelogenous leukemia CML . By this use it is aimed to reverse or prevent resistance to said at least one additional agent.

Because activation of the PI3K Akt pathway drives cell survival inhibition of the pathway in combination with therapies that drive apoptosis in cancer cells including radiotherapy and chemotherapy will result in improved responses Ghobrial et al. CA Cancer J. Clin 55 178 194 2005 . As an example combination of PI3 kinase inhibitor with carboplatin demonstrated synergistic effects in both in vitro proliferation and apoptosis assays as well as in in vivo tumor efficacy in a xenograft model of ovarian cancer Westfall and Skinner Mol. Cancer Ther. 4 1764 1771 2005 .

In addition to cancer and proliferative diseases there is accumulating evidence that inhibitors of Class 1A and 1B PI3 kinases would be therapeutically useful in others disease areas. The inhibition of p110 the PI3K isoform product of the PIK3CB gene has been shown to be involved in shear induced platelet activation Jackson et al. Nature Medicine 11 507 514 2005 . Thus a PI3K inhibitor that inhibits p110 would be useful as a single agent or in combination in anti thrombotic therapy. The isoform p110 the product of the PIK3CD gene is important in B cell function and differentiation Clayton et al. J. Exp. Med. 196 753 763 2002 T cell dependent and independent antigen responses Jou et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 22 8580 8590 2002 and mast cell differentiation Ali et al. Nature 431 1007 1011 2004 . Thus it is expected that p110 inhibitors would be useful in the treatment of B cell driven autoimmune diseases and asthma. Finally the inhibition of p110 the isoform product of the PI3KCG gene results in reduced T but not B cell response Reif et al. J. Immunol. 173 2236 2240 2004 and its inhibition demonstrates efficacy in animal models of autoimmune diseases Camps et al. Nature Medicine 11 936 943 2005 Barber et al. Nature Medicine 11 933 935 2005 .

Representative kits include a PI3K inhibitor compound e.g. a compound of formula I IA IB IC and or I and a package insert or other labeling including directions for treating a cellular proliferative disease by administering a PI3K inhibitory amount of the compound s .

In general the compounds of formula I IA IB IC and or I will be administered in a therapeutically effective amount by any of the accepted modes of administration for agents that serve similar utilities. The actual amount of the compound of formula I IA IB IC and or I i.e. the active ingredient will depend upon numerous factors such as the severity of the disease to be treated the age and relative health of the subject the potency of the compound used the route and form of administration and other factors. The drug can be administered more than once a day preferably once or twice a day. All of these factors are within the skill of the attending clinician. Therapeutically effective amounts of compounds of formulas I may range from about 0.05 to about 50 mg per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day preferably about 0.1 25 mg kg day more preferably from about 0.5 to 10 mg kg day. Thus for administration to a 70 kg person the dosage range would most preferably be about 35 70 mg per day.

In general compounds of formula I IA IB IC and or I will be administered as pharmaceutical compositions by any one of the following routes oral systemic e.g. transdermal intranasal or by suppository or parenteral e.g. intramuscular intravenous or subcutaneous administration. The preferred manner of administration is oral using a convenient daily dosage regimen that can be adjusted according to the degree of affliction. Compositions can take the form of tablets pills capsules semisolids powders sustained release formulations solutions suspensions elixirs aerosols or any other appropriate compositions. Another preferred manner for administering compounds of the formula I is inhalation. This is an effective method for delivering a therapeutic agent directly to the respiratory tract.

The choice of formulation depends on various factors such as the mode of drug administration and bioavailability of the drug substance. For delivery via inhalation the compound can be formulated as liquid solution suspensions aerosol propellants or dry powder and loaded into a suitable dispenser for administration. There are several types of pharmaceutical inhalation devices nebulizer inhalers metered dose inhalers MDI and dry powder inhalers DPI .

Nebulizer devices produce a stream of high velocity air that causes the therapeutic agents which are formulated in a liquid form to spray as a mist that is carried into the patient s respiratory tract. MDI s typically are formulation packaged with a compressed gas. Upon actuation the device discharges a measured amount of therapeutic agent by compressed gas thus affording a reliable method of administering a set amount of agent. DPI dispenses therapeutic agents in the form of a free flowing powder that can be dispersed in the patient s inspiratory air stream during breathing by the device. In order to achieve a free flowing powder the therapeutic agent is formulated with an excipient such as lactose. A measured amount of the therapeutic agent is stored in a capsule form and is dispensed with each actuation.

The inventions also relates to formulations wherein the particle size of a compound of formula I between 10 1000 nm preferably 10 400 nm. Such pharmaceutical formulations have been developed especially for drugs that show poor bioavailability based upon the principle that bioavailability can be increased by increasing the surface area i.e. decreasing particle size. For example U.S. Pat. No. 4 107 288 describes a pharmaceutical formulation having particles in the size range from 10 to 1 000 nm in which the active material is supported on a crosslinked matrix of macromolecules. U.S. Pat. No. 5 145 684 describes the production of a pharmaceutical formulation in which the drug substance is pulverized to nanoparticles average particle size of 400 nm in the presence of a surface modifier and then dispersed in a liquid medium to give a pharmaceutical formulation that exhibits remarkably high bioavailability. Both documents are included by reference.

In a further aspect the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I IA IB IC and or I and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Acceptable excipients are non toxic aid administration and do not adversely affect the therapeutic benefit of the compound of formula I IA IB IC and or I . Such excipient may be any solid liquid semi solid or in the case of an aerosol composition gaseous excipient that is generally available to one of skill in the art. Solid pharmaceutical excipients include starch cellulose talc glucose lactose sucrose gelatin malt rice flour chalk silica gel magnesium stearate sodium stearate glycerol monostearate sodium chloride dried skim milk and the like.

Liquid and semisolid excipients may be selected from glycerol propylene glycol water ethanol and various oils including those of petroleum animal vegetable or synthetic origin e.g. peanut oil soybean oil mineral oil sesame oil etc. Preferred liquid carriers particularly for injectable solutions include water saline aqueous dextrose and glycols.

Compressed gases may be used to disperse a compound of the formula I in aerosol form.
