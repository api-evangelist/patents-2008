A wireless communication system typically includes a base station in wireless communication with a plurality of user devices which may also be referred to as mobile stations subscriber units access terminals etc. . The base station transmits data to the user devices over a radio frequency RF communication channel. The term downlink refers to transmission from a base station to a user device while the term uplink refers to transmission from a user device to a base station.

Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM is a modulation and multiple access technique whereby the transmission band of a communication channel is divided into a number of equally spaced sub bands. A sub carrier carrying a portion of the user information is transmitted in each sub band and every sub carrier is orthogonal with every other sub carrier. Sub carriers are sometimes referred to as tones. OFDM enables the creation of a very flexible system architecture that can be used efficiently for a wide range of services including voice and data. OFDM is sometimes referred to as discrete multi tone transmission DMT .

The 3Generation Partnership Project 3GPP is a collaboration of standards organizations throughout the world. The goal of 3GPP is to make a globally applicable third generation 3G mobile phone system specification within the scope of the IMT 2000 International Mobile Telecommunications 2000 standard as defined by the International Telecommunication Union. The 3GPP Long Term Evolution LTE Committee is considering OFDM as well as OFDM OQAM Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Offset Quadrature Amplitude Modulation as a method for downlink transmission as well as OFDM transmission on the uplink.

Wireless communications systems e.g. Time Division Multiple Access TDMA Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing OFDM usually calculate an estimation of a channel impulse response between the antennas of a user device and the antennas of a base station for coherent receiving. Channel estimation may involve transmitting known reference signals that are multiplexed with the data. Reference signals may include a single frequency and are transmitted over the communication systems for supervisory control equalization continuity synchronization etc. Wireless communication systems may include one or more mobile stations and one or more base stations that each transmit a reference signal. Reference signals may be designed such that a mobile station may re use a reference signal that was previously used by a different mobile station. However a set of sequences used for multiple carrier transmission of reference signals for demodulation may increase storage requirements because there is no minimum cross correlation. As such benefits may be realized by providing systems and methods for generating sequences that are nearest to a set of sequences with minimum average cross correlation.

A method to generate sequences used for wireless communication systems is described. Initial sequences are set to a first set of sequences. A second set of sequences is obtained by projecting the first set of sequences to a space of tight frames. A third set of sequences is obtained by projecting each of subsets of the second set of sequences to a space of orthogonal matrices. A forth set of sequences is obtained by projecting the third set of sequences to a space of circulant matrices. A fifth set of sequences is obtained by projecting the forth set of sequences to a space of matrices with preferable PAPR. Said steps are iterated at least once by setting the fifth set of sequences to the first set of sequences. A sixth set of sequences is obtained by projecting each element of the fifth set of sequences after the iterating step has been executed to a nearest quadrature phase shift keying QPSK constellation point. The sixth set of sequences is outputted.

A method for generating sequences that are nearest to a set of sequences with minimum average cross correlation is described. Each element of a set of sequences is projected to a nearest constellation point. The set of sequences is converted into a time domain representation. An inverse discrete Fourier Transform IDFT is performed on the set of sequences. A cubic metric of each sequence of the set of sequences is evaluated. A sequence is removed from the set if the cubic metric exceeds a threshold. A minimum maximum cross correlation is obtained for the set of sequences.

A communications device that is configured to generate sequences that are nearest to a set of sequences with minimum average cross correlation is also described. The communications device includes a processor and memory in electronic communication with the processor. Instructions are stored in the memory. Each element of a set of sequences is projected to a nearest constellation point. The set of sequences is converted into a time domain representation. An inverse discrete Fourier Transform IDFT is performed on the set of sequences. A cubic metric of each sequence of the set of sequences is evaluated. A sequence is removed from the set if the cubic metric exceeds a threshold. A minimum maximum cross correlation is obtained for the set of sequences.

A computer readable medium that includes executable instructions is also described. Each element of a set of sequences is projected to a nearest constellation point. The set of sequences is converted into a time domain representation. An inverse discrete Fourier Transform IDFT is performed on the set of sequences. A cubic metric of each sequence of the set of sequences is evaluated. A sequence is removed from the set if the cubic metric exceeds a threshold. A minimum maximum cross correlation is obtained for the set of sequences.

Several exemplary examples are now described with reference to the Figures. This detailed description of several exemplary examples as illustrated in the Figures is not intended to limit the scope of the claims.

As used herein the terms an example example examples the example the examples one or more examples some examples certain examples one example another example and the like mean one or more but not necessarily all examples unless expressly specified otherwise.

The term determining and grammatical variants thereof is used in an extremely broad sense. The term determining encompasses a wide variety of actions and therefore determining can include calculating computing processing deriving investigating looking up e.g. looking up in a table a database or another data structure ascertaining and the like. Also determining can include receiving e.g. receiving information accessing e.g. accessing data in a memory and the like. Also determining can include resolving selecting choosing establishing and the like.

The phrase based on does not mean based only on unless expressly specified otherwise. In other words the phrase based on describes both based only on and based at least on. 

Reference signals may be used in communication systems. Reference signals may include a single frequency and are transmitted over the communication systems for supervisory control equalization continuity synchronization etc. Communication systems may include one or more mobile stations and one or more base stations that each transmit a reference signal. Reference signals may be designed such that a mobile station may re use a reference signal that was previously used by a different mobile station or is used at the same time at another mobile station in another cell far enough apart so as to negligibly interfere. Truncation or cyclic extension of a particular set of Zadoff Chu sequences has been utilized to design reference signals for re use. However truncation or cyclic extension may result in a tedious integer programming problem for a sequence assignment. In addition a guarantee of minimal correlation does not exist when truncation or cyclic extension of a particular set of Zadoff Chu sequences are implemented. Further because of variable correlation properties of candidate proposed reference signals detailed planning regarding the mobile station may be done which may be particularly vexing if adjacent networks exist in the same band that are operated by different operators.

The present systems and methods design reference signals for multiple input multiple output MIMO systems in which reference signals are allocated amongst one or more mobile stations for use in single user or multiple user MIMO systems. In one example the present systems and methods design uplink reference signals in a cellular system. Communications from mobile stations to base stations may be classified as uplink communications. Conversely communications from base stations to mobile stations may be classified as downlink communications. Transmitting uplink reference signals in a cellular system may pose stringent requirements on time and frequency resources on the mobile station. These stringent requirements may impede an optimum design of the reference signals for the mobile station which may desire to implement a single or multiple carrier modulation with cyclic prefix where there is synchronization between the transmission of multiple uplink signals and their respective base stations and where sectorization amongst cells of mobile stations is employed to maximize the capacity per cell. In addition the present systems and methods employ multiple bandwidth allocations simultaneously to multiple base stations. In one example each bandwidth segment allocated to a mobile station is an integer amount of some basic unit.

In designing a set of reference signals certain design considerations may be implemented. For example the set may be large enough to cover at least three sectors per cell with at least two reference signals per sector. In one example four reference signals per sector are present. A further design consideration may be that the set of reference signals may be orthogonal in each sector of a given cell. The set of reference signals may also be orthogonal in all sectors adjacent to a given sector. If the reference signals are orthogonal and the reference signals are known to adjacent sectors a best minimum mean square receiver may be designed and implemented.

For those reference signals that are not in adjacent sectors or which are not orthogonal another design consideration may be that these reference signal are minimally correlated with approximately the same correlation and approach if not meet the Welch Bound. Sets of sequences that approach or meet the Welch Bound may denote a tight frame where each vector possesses a unit norm i.e. 1. A further design consideration is the set of reference signals may also have a Peak to Average Power Ratio PAPR that approaches if not equal to 1. The PAPR may be defined as for a sequence vector c as 

Another example of a design consideration may be that amongst subsets of sequences with orthogonal elements each element may be a cyclic shift of another element. This property may be useful to provide robust performance if a transmission system which transmits a cyclic prefix for multipath elimination encounters multipath components with a delay spread greater than the cyclic prefix length. An additional design consideration is that in a system where multiple bandwidths are employed simultaneously the set of reference signal sequences may be recursively generated from a base sequence.

In one example the amount of reference signal space time and frequency resources may be exactly large enough. For example the basic unit of bandwidth allocation may allow for 19 or any larger prime number of reference signals available for two reference signals per sector. In a further example the basic unit of bandwidth allocation may allow for 37 or any larger prime number of reference signals for four reference signals per sector. As in this case if the amount of reference signal space is exactly large enough Zadoff Chu sequences may be taken as the reference sequences as they meet the design considerations previously described. However such resource availability or sequence numerology may not be plausible. The present systems and methods provide an algorithm for designing reference signals based on alternating projections when such resources or sequence numerology are not available.

In addition the present systems and methods minimize the storage taken up by a set of sequences used for multiple carrier transmission of reference signals for demodulation that are designed to have minimum cross correlation subject to a cubic metric parameter. The set of sequences may be represented in the frequency domain prior to an inverse discrete Fourier Transform IDFT . The IDFT may produce a time domain waveform that is utilized to estimate channel characteristics for proper signal demodulation.

As used herein the term OFDM transmitter refers to any component or device that transmits OFDM signals. An OFDM transmitter may be implemented in a base station that transmits OFDM signals to one or more user devices . Alternatively an OFDM transmitter may be implemented in a user device that transmits OFDM signals to one or more base stations .

The term OFDM receiver refers to any component or device that receives OFDM signals. An OFDM receiver may be implemented in a user device that receives OFDM signals from one or more base stations . Alternatively an OFDM receiver may be implemented in a base station that receives OFDM signals from one or more user devices .

The first communication channel and the second communication channel may be separate communication channels . For example there may be no overlap between the transmission band of the first communication channel and the transmission band of the second communication channel

In addition the present systems and methods may be implemented with any modulation that utilizes multiple antennas MIMO transmissions. For example the present systems and methods may be implemented for MIMO Code Division Multiple Access CDMA systems or Time Division Multiple Access TDMA systems.

In single antenna systems multi path propagation may be detrimental to the performance of the system. The multiple propagation paths may cause copies of a signal to arrive at a receiver at slightly different times. These time delayed signals may then become interference when trying to recover the signal of interest. The MIMO system is designed to exploit the multi path propagation to obtain a performance improvement. For example the first receive antenna Rx A may receive a mixture of a first signal and a third signal which are sent from the first transmit antenna Tx A and the second transmit antenna Tx B. The first and third signals may be sent over a first channel hand a second third channel h. The proportion of the first and third signals that is received at the first receive antenna Rx A depends on the transmission channels h h. A simplified equation for the signal received at the first receive antenna Rx A may be Equation 2 

The first receive antenna Rx A receives a combination of what was transmitted from the first and second transmit antennas A B. The MIMO system may implement various coding schemes that define which signals should be transmitted and at what times to enable an original signal to be recovered when it is received in combination with another signal. These coding schemes may be known as space time codes because they define a code across space antennas and time symbols .

Data symbols may be modulated by a modulation component . The modulated data symbols may be analyzed by other subsystems . The analyzed data symbols may be provided to a reference processing component . The reference processing component may generate a reference signal that may be transmitted with the data symbols. The modulated data symbols and the reference signal may be communicated to an end processing component . The end processing component may combine the reference signal and the modulated data symbols into a signal. The transmitter may receive the signal and transmit the signal to a receiver through an antenna .

In one example a third matrix may be computed . The third matrix may be the closest matrix with a minimum peak to average power ratio to the second matrix. The third matrix may also be expanded and a fourth matrix may be computed from the expansion. In one example a fifth matrix is computed that is a nearest circulant matrix to the fourth matrix. The first matrix may be set to the fifth matrix. In other words the first matrix may be assigned the included in the fifth matrix. The fourth matrix and the fifth matrix may be outputted . In addition a maximum inner product of the fourth and fifth matrices may also be outputted .

The following may represent steps taken to compute a correlated set of matrices that is the closest matrix with a minimum peak to average power ratio. A sequence of N column vectors x x C d N may be assigned as columns of a matrix X xx. . . x . The matrix may be referred to as a frame. Each vector may have unit length without any loss in generality. Block of K of these vectors may be grouped into a set of matrices Xso that with MK N X XX. . . X . The correlation between vectors may be represented as which is the standard inner product in complex Euclidean d space.

A frame that meets or approaches the Welch Bound may be referred to as a tight frame. The design considerations previously mentioned imply that for any not in the same X where is a constant determined by the Welch Bound provided above. If any matrix Z C is provided the matrix that comes closest in distance as measured in element wise or Frobenius norm may be given by ZZ Z. This condition may also enforce an orthnormality condition between rows of X if an optimal X exists.

The design considerations previously mentioned also imply that X X I with K d . In other words each column in any Xmay be orthogonal to any other column in X. The above may be repeated with the role of X above being assumed by X. Further if as few as two sequences are required per cell i.e. per matrix X a phase parity check may be implemented to provide orthogonality between column vectors in Xwhen there are zero entries in any column of X. In other words the phase of the zero components are chosen such that orthogonality if maintained once each column vector has minimal Peak to Average Power Ratio.

The following may illustrate steps taken to obtain the circulant matrix nearest to a given matrix. A matrix Z z. . . z may be provided where each zis a column vector C. A circulant matrix C c. . . c may be obtained that is closest in Frobenius element wise norm to Z. In one example F may be given as the Discrete Fourier Transform DFT matrix 

A diagonal delay matrix D may be defined as D diag 1 ee. . . e . For any ciculant matrix C C FAF where A is the DFT of the sequence vector c. In addition it may be shown that c FDF c FDF c.

Matrices where the number of column vectors are not equal to the number of row vectors may be referred to as reduced rank matrices Z has fewer than N columns . Modifications may be implemented to the recurrence relation c FDF cand the forming of the appropriate matrix B. If only two vectors were required that were cyclic shifted three elements apart then c FDF cand B may include the matrix elements Iand FDF .

In one example ZZ Z may be computed and assigned to the matrix Y. This may result in the tight frame nearest to Z. The following constraints may be implemented. If zero entries exist in column vectors of Y phases to their related components in Y may be added so that orthogonality is maintained. For m 1 to M WmWm Wm may be computed and assigned to a vector V. The matrix V VV. . . V may be assembled.

In one example the max may be computed. Further a Q matrix may be computed that is a nearest circulant matrix to V and max may also be computed. A W matrix may be computed . The W matrix may be the closest matrix with minimum PAPR to Y. The W matrix may be expressed as W WW. . . W . The Z matrix may be assigned as the Q matrix. If a circulant matrix is not desired the Z matrix may be assigned as the V matrix. In one example t is updated as t 1. The V matrix and the Q matrix may be outputted . In addition max and max may also be outputted .

The matrices designed from the methods described above in connection with and may be referred to as a set of sequences. is a flow diagram illustrating one example of a method for generating sequences that are nearest to a set of sequences with minimum average cross correlation. In one example the generated sequences may be quadrature phase shift keyed QPSK sequences. The QPSK sequences may be generated for multiple carrier transmission modulated MIMO systems.

In one example each element of each sequence designed from the methods of and is projected to a nearest constellation point to produce a first set of sequences. The constellation point may be a QPSK constellation point. In other words the first set of sequences may be defined by those sequences taken with elements drawn from the set

The first set of sequences may be converted to a second set of sequences that are in a time domain representation from which N orthogonal cyclic shifts of a time domain waveform may be produced. N may represent the sequence length. An inverse discrete Fourier Transform IDFT may be performed on the second set of sequences to produce a third set of sequences. As an example the third set is produced such that if one hundred root sequences were used to begin with and the sequence length N was twelve a set of 1200 sequences may be produced.

Each set of sequences within the third set may include one root sequence that is identical to the original sequence. In one example the cubic metric of each sequence of the third set is evaluated . Any sequence that is associated with a root sequence whose cubic metric exceeds a desired threshold may be removed . In addition other sequences associated with that root sequences may be removed from the third set. Once the sequences from the third set are removed the remaining sequences form a fourth set of sequences.

In one example a fifth set of sequences is formed . A minimum maximum cross correlation may be obtained from the fifth set of sequences.

The communications device may also include a housing that includes a transmitter and a receiver to allow transmission and reception of data. The transmitter and receiver may be combined into a transceiver . An antenna is attached to the housing and electrically coupled to the transceiver . Additional antennas not shown may also be used.

The communications device may also include a signal detector used to detect and quantify the level of signals received by the transceiver . The signal detector detects such signals as total energy pilot energy power spectral density and other signals.

A state changer controls the state of the communications device based on a current state and additional signals received by the transceiver and detected by the signal detector . The communications device may be capable of operating in any one of a number of states.

The various components of the communications device are coupled together by a bus system which may include a power bus a control signal bus and a status signal bus in addition to a data bus. However for the sake of clarity the various buses are illustrated in as the bus system . The communications device may also include a digital signal processor DSP for use in processing signals.
