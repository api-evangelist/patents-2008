The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to munitions and in particular to cleaning brushes for gun chambers.

Projectiles or rounds launched from gun tubes may foul the gun tube s chamber. Some gun tubes such as the 105 mm gun M68A1E4 used on combat vehicles may have tapered firing chambers and forcing cone areas. Soldiers have experienced problems with cleaning the tapered firing chamber and forcing cone of some gun tubes. The forcing cone area of the gun tube has been susceptible to carbon build up from fired rounds. The contamination and build up has been significant enough to cause difficulties in chambering loading a round and pitting corrosion has been present in unclean chambers.

A tool to effectively clean this area of the gun has not been available. In the past this area of the gun tube was cleaned using wire hand brushes a screwdriver and a rag. Or the gun tube was soaked for a few days with a solvent to first reduce the carbon contamination build up and then the area was cleaned using the hand tools. A need exists for a tool to better clean the firing chamber and forcing cone area of gun tubes.

One aspect of the invention is a brush for cleaning a gun chamber comprising a generally cylindrical body at least three groups of bristles spaced axially apart along the body and a pivot ring disposed on the body between two of the groups of bristles.

The body may include a larger diameter portion and a smaller diameter portion. At least one group of bristles may be disposed on the larger diameter portion and at least two groups of bristles may be disposed on the smaller diameter portion. The body may include a circumferential groove formed adjacent the pivot ring. The brush may further comprise a snap ring disposed in the circumferential groove.

Each of the at least three groups of bristles may include subgroups of bristles spaced circumferentially around the body. The subgroups of bristles may be equally spaced circumferentially around the body. The subgroups of bristles may comprise individual tufts. The tufts may be arranged generally helically around the body.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The inventive chamber brush may be tapered with many angular surfaces to follow the contours and tapers within the gun tube s chamber. The chamber brush may readily clean the gun tube s chamber with minimal effort compared to the old manual methods of cleaning the chamber. In addition to keeping the chamber clean and allowing a round to be inserted more readily another advantage of a clean chamber is that it may significantly reduce pits that occur due to contamination. These pits reduce the life of the gun tube because they induce stress concentrations that can lead to cracking and failure.

The chamber brush may be mounted on a threaded staff or rod. The user may insert the brush into the chamber and push the brush toward the end of the firing chamber i.e. the forcing cone by hand while also rotating the brush. When the forcing cone is reached the brush cannot move further axially because it is stopped on the pivot ring. At this point the brush may be rotated by hand to remove residue. This procedure may be repeated several times until the firing chamber is visually clean. Rotating the brush while moving the brush forward cleans the walls of the chamber. The forcing cone or tapered area may be cleaned by rotating the brush while keeping the brush axially stationary. Axial and circumferential gaps between the individual brush tufts allow corrosion material to be collected and removed when the brush exits the chamber.

A pivot ring may be disposed on the body between two of the groups of bristles for example between groups and . Body may include a circumferential groove formed adjacent the pivot ring . A snap ring may be disposed in groove . Snap ring may help to maintain the position of pivot ring .

Body may be formed of for example polyvinylchloride. Body may include a larger diameter portion and a smaller diameter portion At least one group of bristles may be disposed on the larger diameter portion and at least two groups of bristles may be disposed on the smaller diameter portion .

Each of the at least three groups of bristles may include subgroups of bristles spaced circumferentially around the body . For example bristle group may include subgroups and so. Bristle group may include subgroups and so on. Bristle group may include subgroups and so on. The subgroups of bristles may be spaced equally circumferentially around the body . Similar to the axial spaces between the bristle groups the circumferential spaces between the subgroups of each bristle group provide space for containing material that is fouling or contaminants for example from inside the gun chamber until the brush is removed from the gun chamber.

The number of subgroups of bristles in each bristle group may vary. In one embodiment bristle groups and may include eight subgroups and bristle group may include nine subgroups. Each subgroup may include a plurality of tufts . The number of tufts per bristle subgroup may vary. In the embodiment shown in the Figs. the number of tufts for each subgroup may be seven. The tufts of each subgroup may be arranged in a variety of ways. In one embodiment the tufts of each subgroup may be arranged generally helically on the body .

The pitch of a subgroup of tufts is akin to the pitch of a screw thread or the pitch of a propeller. For example the tufts of each of the subgroups of the bristle groups may have a pitch in the range of about 5 inches to about 15 inches. The tufts of the subgroups and so on of bristle group may have for example a pitch in the range of about 11 inches to about 16 inches and preferably the pitch may be about 13.5 inches. The tufts of the subgroups and so on of bristle group may have for example a pitch in the range of about 10 to about to about 15 inches and preferably the pitch may be about 12.5 inches. The tufts of the subgroups and so on of bristle group may have a pitch in the range of about 8 inches to about 13 inches and preferably the pitch may be about 10.9 inches.

The arrangement of the tufts subgroups of bristles and groups of bristles may be such that at a transverse cross section of a gun tube substantially the entire internal circumference of the tube is contacted by the tufts when the brush is inserted in the tube even without rotating the brush in the tube.

The diameter of each tuft may vary. In one embodiment the diameter of a tuft may be about 0.19 inches. Each tuft may comprise a plurality of strands . An exemplary composition of strands in a tuft may be about 70 of 0.006 inch diameter phosphor bronze strands and about 30 of 0.008 inch diameter nylon strands.

As seen in the outside diameter of the brush measured from the tip of one tuft to the tip of a diametrically opposite tuft may decrease from end to end . The largest diameter is indicated as A at end and the smallest diameter is indicated as B at end . In one embodiment the brush outside diameter in bristle group may decrease from about 5.34 inches to about 5.01 inches the brush outside diameter in bristle group may decrease from about 4.90 inches to about 4.55 inches and the brush outside diameter in bristle group may decrease from about 4.66 inches to about 4.37 inches.

One end of the body may include a threaded opening . A rod not shown may be threaded into opening and may be used to insert the brush in a gun tube. An opposite end of the body may include a slot . The slot may be used when threading the brush onto or off of the rod. Particularly when the brush is soiled one may use for example a screwdriver or metal plate inserted into slot to unthread the brush from the rod.

As shown in the pivot ring may include a generally annular member and at least one projection extending beyond the outside diameter of the annular member . In one embodiment the number of projections may be four. The projections may be circumferentially spaced equally around the annular member . Pivot ring may provide a stop for the brush so that the brush may rotate in the gun chamber without being jammed or pushed too far into the narrow end of the chamber. In the embodiment shown the projections prevent the brush from being jammed or pushed too far into the narrow end of the chamber.

The brush may include a storage container for example the storage container shown in . Container may have a frusto conical shape for example with a closed bottom end and an open top end . Top end includes opening for inserting the brush therein. The materials for container or storage bag may be selected based on their ability to resist any residual solvents that may exist on the brush and thereby deteriorate or breakdown the container material.

The container or storage bag may comprise an outer layer . Outer layer may comprise for example a polyvinylchloride PVC coated fabric such as PVC coated nylon or polyester for example. The fabric may be for example a nine ounce fabric.

Container may include an inner layer . Inner layer may partially cover the interior side surfaces of container . For example in inner layer may extend from about the bottom of the container a distance D towards the top of the container. The distance D may be for example about three fourths of the distance from the bottom to the top of the container. Inner layer may comprise a layer of high density polyethylene HDPE having a thickness of for example about 0.03 inches covered by a layer of closed cell foam cushioning having a thickness of for example about 0.38 inches. A suitable closed cell foam may be sold under the name VOLARA. The foam layer may be the interior layer of inner layer that is the foam layer may contact the brush .

The bottom of container may comprise a double layer of the PVC coated fabric used for outer layer and an interior layer of the closed cell foam used in inner layer . A drawstring may be used to close opening . Drawstring may comprise for example braided nylon rope about 0.125 inches in diameter.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
