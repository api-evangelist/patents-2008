Cancer is a generic name for a wide range of cellular malignancies characterized by unregulated growth lack of differentiation and the ability to invade local tissues and metastasize. These neoplastic malignancies affect with various degrees of prevalence every tissue and organ in the body.

A multitude of therapeutic agents have been developed over the past few decades for the treatment of various types of cancer. The most commonly used types of anticancer agents include DNA alkylating agents e.g. cyclophosphamide ifosfamide anti metabolites e.g. methotrexate a folate antagonist and 5 fluorouracil a pyrimidine antagonist microtubule disrupters e.g. vincristine vinblastine paclitaxel DNA intercalators e.g. doxorubicin daunomycin cisplatin and hormone therapy e.g. tamoxifen flutamide .

Colorectal cancer is among the leading causes of cancer related morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Treatment of this cancer depends largely on the size location and stage of the tumor whether the malignancy has spread to other parts of the body metastasis and on the patient s general state of health. Options include surgical removal of tumors for early stage localized disease chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However chemotherapy is currently the only treatment for metastatic disease. 5 fluorouracil is currently the most effective single agent treatment for advanced colorectal cancer with response rates of about 10 . Additionally new agents such as the topoisomerase I inhibitor irinotecan CPT11 the platinum based cytotoxic agent oxaliplatin e.g. ELOXATIN and the EGFR kinase inhibitor erlotinib 6 7 bis 2 methoxyethoxy 4 quinazolin 4 yl 3 ethynylphenyl amine e.g. erlotinib HCl TARCEVA have shown promise in treatment.

Over expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR kinase or its ligand TGF alpha is frequently associated with many cancers including breast lung colorectal and head and neck cancers Salomon D. S. et al. 1995 Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 19 183 232 Wells A. 2000 Signal 1 4 11 and is believed to contribute to the malignant growth of these tumors. A specific deletion mutation in the EGFR gene has also been found to increase cellular tumorigenicity Halatsch M E. et al. 2000 J. Neurosurg. 92 297 305 Archer G. E. et al. 1999 Clin. Cancer Res. 5 2646 2652 . Activation of EGFR stimulated signaling pathways promote multiple processes that are potentially cancer promoting e.g. proliferation angiogenesis cell motility and invasion decreased apoptosis and induction of drug resistance. The development for use as anti tumor agents of compounds that directly inhibit the kinase activity of the EGFR as well as antibodies that reduce EGFR kinase activity by blocking EGFR activation are areas of intense research effort de Bono J. S and Rowinsky E. K. 2002 Trends in Mol. Medicine. 8 S19 S26 Dancey J. and Sausville E. A. 2003 Nature Rev. Drug Discovery 2 92 313 . Several studies have demonstrated or disclosed that some EGFR kinase inhibitors can improve tumor cell or neoplasia killing when used in combination with certain other anti cancer or chemotherapeutic agents or treatments e.g. Raben D. et al. 2002 Semin.

An anti neoplastic drug would ideally kill cancer cells selectively with a wide therapeutic index relative to its toxicity towards non malignant cells. It would also retain its efficacy against malignant cells even after prolonged exposure to the drug. Unfortunately none of the current chemotherapies possess such an ideal profile. Instead most possess very narrow therapeutic indexes. Furthermore cancerous cells exposed to slightly sub lethal concentrations of a chemotherapeutic agent will very often develop resistance to such an agent and quite often cross resistance to several other antineoplastic agents as well.

Thus there is a need for more efficacious treatment for neoplasia and other proliferative disorders. Strategies for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of existing drugs have involved changes in the schedule for their administration and also their use in combination with other anticancer or biochemical modulating agents. Combination therapy is well known as a method that can result in greater efficacy and diminished side effects relative to the use of the therapeutically relevant dose of each agent alone. In some cases the efficacy of the drug combination is additive the efficacy of the combination is approximately equal to the sum of the effects of each drug alone but in other cases the effect is synergistic the efficacy of the combination is greater than the sum of the effects of each drug given alone . For example when combined with 5 FU and leucovorin oxaliplatin exhibits response rates of 25 40 as first line treatment for colorectal cancer Raymond E. et al. 1998 Semin Oncol. 25 2 Suppl. 5 4 12 .

Growth factors acting through receptor tyrosine kinases RTKs drive tumor initiation and progression by accelerating cell proliferation and promoting cell survival. The RTKs for epidermal growth factor EGF and insulin like growth factor IGF contribute to tumorigenesis for a multitude of tumor types including non small cell lung cancer NSCLC colorectal pancreatic and breast tumors Holbro T. and Hynes N.

Jr. 2004 . The ErbB HER receptor protein tyrosine kinases and cancer. Biochem Biophys Res Commun 319 1 11. Tumor cells can exhibit redundancy surrounding RTKs that contributes to de novo resistance to a single RTK inhibitor and crosstalk between RTKs can confer acquired resistance whereby the inhibition of one RTK is compensated by enhanced activity through an alternative RTK. It has been shown that IGF 1R signaling is associated with acquired resistance of cancer cells to chemo or radiation therapies and molecular targeted therapies including epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR inhibition. Indeed it has recently been shown that in several different cancer types the efficacy of EGFR and ErbB2 signal transduction inhibitors could be acutely attenuated by IGF 1R activation of the PI3 kinase Akt pathway Chakravarti A.

US2004 0106605 is entitled Synergistic Methods and Compositions for Treating Cancer and generally refers to combinations of IGF1R inhibitors with EGFR inhibitors.

The present invention includes compositions and methods for treating cancer. In particular the present invention is directed to combination compositions and dual therapy or combined treatment of patients with substituted heterobicyclic IGF1R protein kinase inhibitors and anti cancer agents. The invention described herein provides new drug combinations and methods for using drug combinations in the treatment of cancer.

This invention provides anti cancer combination therapies that reduce the dosages for individual components required for efficacy thereby decreasing side effects associated with each agent while maintaining or increasing therapeutic value.

The present invention includes a method for treating tumors or tumor metastases in a patient comprising administering to the patient simultaneously or sequentially a therapeutically effective amount of a at least one anti cancer agent such as an agent which inhibits serine phosphorylation of IRS1 IRS1 agent such as an EGFR inhibitor and b at least one IGF1R inhibitor in combination with or without additional agents or treatments such as other anti cancer drugs or radiation therapy wherein the IGF1R inhibitor relates to compounds of Formula I as defined herein 

The invention also encompasses a pharmaceutical composition that is comprising a at least one anti cancer agent such as IRS1 agent such as an EGFR inhibitor and b at least one IGF1R inhibitor in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier wherein the IGF1R inhibitor is selected from compounds and salts of Formula I above.

It has been discovered by the present inventors that agents that prevent serine phosphorylation of the IGF 1R adaptor protein IRS1 potentiate IGF driven Akt thereby enhancing sensitivity to IGF 1R inhibition. As a result the present invention is directed to methods for treating cancer patients comprising administering to the patient simultaneously or sequentially a therapeutically effective amount of an a IGF1R protein kinase inhibitor compound of Formula I in combination with an agent which inhibits serine phosphorylation of IRS1 with or without additional agents or treatments such as other anti cancer drugs or radiation therapy. According to the invention agents that inhibit serine phosphorylation of IRS1 include inhibitors of the MAPK pathway including for example EGFR inhibitors MEK inhibitors Ras inhibitors Raf inhibitors and PKC inhibitors.

As further described below EGFR and IGF IR can cooperate to regulate tumor growth and survival. The present inventors have found that for epithelial tumor cells but not for mesenchymal like tumor cells Akt is controlled synergistically by EGFR and IGF IR. Two molecular aspects contributing to synergy were identified 1 inhibition of EGFR or IGF 1R individually promotes activation of the reciprocal receptor and 2 inhibition of EGFR directed MAPK shifts regulation of Akt from EGFR towards IGF 1R. Specifically inhibition of the MAPK pathway by EGFR blockade circumvents a negative feedback loop imposed on the IGF 1R IRS 1 signaling complex. The synergistic inhibition of Akt achieved by co targeting EGFR and IGF 1R in epithelial tumor cells conferred synergistic apoptosis and growth inhibition in vitro and growth regression in vivo.

Without being bound by a particular theory the present inventors find that the ability of an agent which inhibits serine phosphorylation of IRS1 such as erlotinib to inhibit the MAPK pathway is responsible for the potentiation of IGF driven Akt and this is likely mediated by augmented coupling of IGF 1R to Akt through IRS 1. The ability of IRS 1 phosphorylation at select serine sites to tightly regulate activity has been observed. Serine phosphorylation of IRS 1 promotes a decrease in the ability of IGF 1R to couple to downstream effectors including PI3K by affecting either the stability of IRS 1 or by affecting protein protein interactions between receptor and effector. It was found by the present inventors that inhibition of EGFR conferred a decrease in IRS 1 serine phosphorylation only in tumor cells for which Erk activity was inhibited by erlotinib and a specific inhibitor of the MAPK pathway evoked an increase in Akt phosphorylation that was associated with a decrease in IRS 1 serine phosphorylation. According to an aspect of the present invention this increase in Akt phosphorylation could be blocked by the combination of an IGF 1R inhibitor and synergistic growth inhibition for the combination of IGFR inhibitors with inhibitors of the MAPK pathway such as EGFR inhibitors and MEK inhibitors was observed. The ability of the MAPK pathway to affect the serine phosphorylation of IRS 1 could be mediated either directly through Erk or indirectly through Erk s ability to transactivate p70S6K. Therefore inhibition of the MAPK pathway such as by EGFR inhibition or MEK inhibition primes signaling through the IGF 1R to sustain Akt activity and cell survival.

An aspect of the present invention is directed to methods for treating cancer patients comprising administering to the patient simultaneously or sequentially a therapeutically effective amount of an agent which inhibits serine phosphorylation of IRS1 and a IGF1R protein kinase inhibitor compound of Formula I combination with or without additional agents or treatments such as other anti cancer drugs or radiation therapy. This aspect of the present invention is also directed to combined treatment of patients with the IGF1R protein kinase inhibitors of Formula I and their salts and epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR kinase inhibitors and their salts.

The present invention is directed to compositions and methods for treating cancer patients comprising administering to the patient simultaneously or sequentially a therapeutically effective amount of an epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR kinase inhibitor and a novel heterobicyclic IGF1R protein kinase inhibitor compound of Formula I combination with or without additional agents or treatments such as other anti cancer drugs or radiation therapy. The present invention is also directed to compositions and combined or sequential treatment of patients with novel heterobicyclic IGF1R protein kinase inhibitors their salts and compositions comprising them and epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR kinase inhibitors their salts or compositions comprising them. The invention further encompasses a pharmaceutical composition that is comprised of an EGFR kinase inhibitor and IGF1R inhibitor combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

The present invention includes compositions and methods for treating cancer patients comprising administering to the patient simultaneously or sequentially a therapeutically effective amount of an IRS1 agent such as an EGFR kinase inhibitor and an IGF1R inhibitor combination with or without additional agents or treatments such as other anti cancer drugs or radiation therapy wherein the IGF1R inhibitor is a compound of Formula I

The use of the cytotoxic and other anticancer agents described above in chemotherapeutic regimens is generally well characterized in the cancer therapy arts and their use herein falls under the same considerations for monitoring tolerance and effectiveness and for controlling administration routes and dosages with some adjustments. For example the actual dosages of the cytotoxic agents may vary depending upon the patient s cultured cell response determined by using histoculture methods. Generally the dosage will be reduced compared to the amount used in the absence of additional other agents.

Typical dosages of an effective cytotoxic agent can be in the ranges recommended by the manufacturer and where indicated by in vitro responses or responses in animal models can be reduced by up to about one order of magnitude concentration or amount. Thus the actual dosage will depend upon the judgment of the physician the condition of the patient and the effectiveness of the therapeutic method based on the in vitro responsiveness of the primary cultured malignant cells or histocultured tissue sample or the responses observed in the appropriate animal models.

Where the EGFR kinase inhibitor according to this invention is an antibody it is also possible to label the antibody with such radioactive isotopes.

Radiation therapy is a standard treatment for controlling unresectable or inoperable tumors and or tumor metastases. Improved results have been seen when radiation therapy has been combined with chemotherapy. Radiation therapy is based on the principle that high dose radiation delivered to a target area will result in the death of reproductive cells in both tumor and normal tissues. The radiation dosage regimen is generally defined in terms of radiation absorbed dose Gy time and fractionation and must be carefully defined by the oncologist. The amount of radiation a patient receives will depend on various considerations but the two most important are the location of the tumor in relation to other critical structures or organs of the body and the extent to which the tumor has spread. A typical course of treatment for a patient undergoing radiation therapy will be a treatment schedule over a 1 to 6 week period with a total dose of between 10 and 80 Gy administered to the patient in a single daily fraction of about 1.8 to 2.0 Gy 5 days a week. In a preferred embodiment of this invention there is synergy when tumors in human patients are treated with the combination treatment of the invention and radiation. In other words the inhibition of tumor growth by means of the agents comprising the combination of the invention is enhanced when combined with radiation optionally with additional chemotherapeutic or anticancer agents. Parameters of adjuvant radiation therapies are for example contained in International Patent Publication WO 99 60023.

The IRS1 agent will typically be administered to the patient in a dose regimen that provides for the most effective treatment of the cancer from both efficacy and safety perspectives for which the patient is being treated as known in the art and as disclosed e.g. in International Patent Publication No. WO 01 34574. In conducting the treatment method of the present invention the IRS1 agent can be administered in any effective manner known in the art such as by oral topical intravenous intra peritoneal intramuscular intra articular subcutaneous intranasal intra ocular vaginal rectal or intradermal routes depending upon the type of cancer being treated the type of IRS1 agent being used e.g. small molecule antibody RNAi or antisense construct and the medical judgment of the prescribing physician as based e.g. on the results of published clinical studies.

The amount of IRS1 agent such as an EGFR kinase inhibitor administered and the timing of IRS1 agent administration will depend on the type species gender age weight etc. and condition of the patient being treated the severity of the disease or condition being treated and on the route of administration. For example a small molecule IRS1 agent can be administered to a patient in doses ranging from 0.001 to 100 mg kg of body weight per day or per week in single or divided doses or by continuous infusion see for example International Patent Publication No. WO 01 34574 . In particular erlotinib HCl can be administered to a patient in doses ranging from 5 200 mg per day or 100 1600 mg per week in single or divided doses or by continuous infusion. A preferred dose is 150 mg day. Antibody based IRS1 agents or antisense RNAi or ribozyme constructs can be administered to a patient in doses ranging from 0.1 to 100 mg kg of body weight per day or per week in single or divided doses or by continuous infusion. In some instances dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect provided that such larger doses are first divided into several small doses for administration throughout the day.

The IRS1 agents such as EGFR kinase inhibitors and IGF1R protein kinase inhibitors can be administered either separately or together by the same or different routes and in a wide variety of different dosage forms. For example the EGFR kinase inhibitor is preferably administered orally or parenterally whereas the IGFLR protein kinase inhibitor compound of Formula I is preferably administered parenterally. Where the EGFR kinase inhibitor is erlotinib HCl TARCEVA oral administration is preferable.

The IRS1 agent can be administered with various pharmaceutically acceptable inert carriers in the form of tablets capsules lozenges troches hard candies powders sprays creams salves suppositories jellies gels pastes lotions ointments elixirs syrups and the like. Administration of such dosage forms can be carried out in single or multiple doses. Carriers include solid diluents or fillers sterile aqueous media and various non toxic organic solvents etc. Oral pharmaceutical compositions can be suitably sweetened and or flavored.

Although antibodies useful in practicing the invention can be polyclonal monoclonal antibodies are preferred. Monoclonal antibodies against EGFR can be prepared and isolated using any technique that provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture. Techniques for production and isolation include but are not limited to the hybridoma technique originally described by Kohler and Milstein Nature 1975 256 495 497 the human B cell hybridoma technique Kosbor et al. 1983 Immunology Today 4 72 Cote et al. 1983 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80 2026 2030 and the EBV hybridoma technique Cole et al 1985 Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy Alan R. Liss Inc. pp. 77 96 .

Alternatively Fab and or scFv expression libraries can be constructed see e.g. Huse et al. 1989 Science 246 1275 1281 to allow rapid identification of fragments having the desired specificity to EGFR.

Techniques for the production and isolation of monoclonal antibodies and antibody fragments are well known in the art and are described in Harlow and Lane 1988 Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and in J. W. Goding 1986 Monoclonal Antibodies Principles and Practice Academic Press London. Humanized anti EGFR antibodies and antibody fragments can also be prepared according to known techniques such as those described in Vaughn T. J. et al. 1998 Nature Biotech. 16 535 539 and references cited therein and such antibodies or fragments thereof are also useful in practicing the present invention.

EGFR kinase inhibitors for use in the present invention can alternatively be based on antisense oligonucleotide constructs. Anti sense oligonucleotides including anti sense RNA molecules and anti sense DNA molecules would act to directly block the translation of EGFR mRNA by binding thereto and thus preventing protein translation or increasing mRNA degradation thus decreasing the level of EGFR kinase protein and thus activity in a cell. For example antisense oligonucleotides of at least about 15 bases and complementary to unique regions of the mRNA transcript sequence encoding EGFR can be synthesized e.g. by conventional phosphodiester techniques and administered by e.g. intravenous injection or infusion. Methods for using antisense techniques for specifically inhibiting gene expression of genes whose sequence is known are well known in the art e.g. see U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 566 135 6 566 131 6 365 354 6 410 323 6 107 091 6 046 321 and 5 981 732 .

Small inhibitory RNAs siRNAs can also function as EGFR kinase inhibitors for use in the present invention. EGFR gene expression can be reduced by contacting the tumor subject or cell with a small double stranded RNA dsRNA or a vector or construct causing the production of a small double stranded RNA such that expression of EGFR is specifically inhibited i.e. RNA interference or RNAi . Methods for selecting an appropriate dsRNA or dsRNA encoding vector are well known in the art for genes whose sequence is known e.g. see Tuschi T. et al. 1999 Genes Dev. 13 24 3191 3197 Elbashir S. M. et al. 2001 Nature 411 494 498 Hannon G. J. 2002 Nature 418 244 251 McManus M. T. and Sharp P. A. 2002 Nature Reviews Genetics 3 737 747 Bremmelkamp T. R. et al. 2002 Science 296 550 553 U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 573 099 and 6 506 559 and International Patent Publication Nos. WO 01 36646 WO 99 32619 and WO 01 68836 .

Ribozymes can also function as EGFR kinase inhibitors for use in the present invention. Ribozymes are enzymatic RNA molecules capable of catalyzing the specific cleavage of RNA. The mechanism of ribozyme action involves sequence specific hybridization of the ribozyme molecule to complementary target RNA followed by endonucleolytic cleavage. Engineered hammerhead motif ribozyme molecules that specifically and efficiently catalyze endonucleolytic cleavage of EGFR mRNA sequences are thereby useful within the scope of the present invention. Specific ribozyme cleavage sites within any potential RNA target are initially identified by scanning the target molecule for ribozyme cleavage sites which typically include the following sequences GUA GUU and GUC. Once identified short RNA sequences of between about 15 and 20 ribonucleotides corresponding to the region of the target gene containing the cleavage site can be evaluated for predicted structural features such as secondary structure that can render the oligonucleotide sequence unsuitable. The suitability of candidate targets can also be evaluated by testing their accessibility to hybridization with complementary oligonucleotides using e.g. ribonuclease protection assays.

Both antisense oligonucleotides and ribozymes useful as EGFR kinase inhibitors can be prepared by known methods. These include techniques for chemical synthesis such as e.g. by solid phase phosphoramadite chemical synthesis. Alternatively anti sense RNA molecules can be generated by in vitro or in vivo transcription of DNA sequences encoding the RNA molecule. Such DNA sequences can be incorporated into a wide variety of vectors that incorporate suitable RNA polymerase promoters such as the T7 or SP6 polymerase promoters. Various modifications to the oligonucleotides of the invention can be introduced as a means of increasing intracellular stability and half life. Possible modifications include but are not limited to the addition of flanking sequences of ribonucleotides or deoxyribonucleotides to the 5 and or 3 ends of the molecule or the use of phosphorothioate or 2 O methyl rather than phosphodiesterase linkages within the oligonucleotide backbone.

Recently the EGFR has emerged as a key target for anticancer therapeutics. Erlotnib TARCEVA OSI 774 is a potent orally active and bioavailable selective small molecule inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor HER1 erbB1 tyrosine kinase TK which blocks signal transaction pathways implicated in proliferation and survival of cancer cells and is in phase III clinical trial. Erlotinib inhibits phosphorylation of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain thereby blocking key signal transduction molecules downstream from the receptor. Erlotinib is being tested in Phase III clinical trials in NSCLC and is also being tested in other types of solid tumors.

Human colorectal cancer represents one of the most prevalent human carcinomas. Surgical resection is the only curative treatment. Since the majority of patients present in an advanced stage of disease with metastatic spread surgery alone is not a good enough clinical approach. Newer treatments are being sought to better manage this disease. Ideally these would come in the form of new single agent entities. The trend for novel agents however is to pursue targets inherent only to the cancer cells. With this precise targeting comes the assumption of a better toxicity profile compared to traditional cytotoxic agents.

Many traditional cytotoxics have single agent activity in cancer. Since only modest objective responses were seen with monotherapy regimens a combination approach is considered a better approach. The ideal regimen would be two agents with different mechanisms which could therefore potentially achieve synergic or additive efficacy with toxicity reduced or similar to monotherapy treatment. Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor seems to have the promising perspective for achieving this goal when combined with traditional chemotherapeutics.

Several EGFR inhibitors are in the later stages of clinical development. Two antibodies against EGFR have been developed. Cetuximab C225 ERBITUX a chimeric antibody which competitively inhibits the activation of EGFR and ABX EGF a fully humanized antibody to EGFR that is postulated to escape degradation post internalization and therefore gets recycled. Impressive clinical results have been seen with Cetuximab and Phase II results from ABX EGF are pending. Several small molecules are also in development. Of particular interest are IRESSA ZD1839 CI 1033 and TARCEVA OSI 774 . CI 1033 being earliest in development is a nonspecific irreversible inhibitor of all EGFR family members. Data from later stage trials with this compound are pending. IRESSA received FDA approval as third line treatment for NSCLC in May 2003.

The goal of this study is to assess the ability of IGF 1R inhibitors to potentiate TARCEVA erlotinib effects on cell survival in the presence of IGF 1 and the ability of IGF 1R inhibitors in combination with TARCEVA to reduce cell viability and modulate downstream signaling pathways namely Ras MAPK and PI3K AKT and to promote apoptosis in human non small cell lung carcinoma NSCLC cells colorectal cancer CRC breast and pancreatic cancer cells in vitro as well as to inhibit the tumor growth in mouse xenograft models.

The in vitro and in vivo efficacy of both IGF 1R inhibitors and an EGFR inhibitor TARCEVA is significantly enhanced when used in combination which was demonstrated and resulted in methods for the treatment of various cancers by using combinations of an EGFR inhibitor TARCEVA and IGF 1R inhibitors. In addition the modulation of downstream Ras MAPK and PI3K AKT pathways can be used for cancer patient selection for such treatment.

Cell lines from NSCLC colorectal breast and pancreatic were maintained under standard cell culture conditions described by ATCC unless otherwise noted.

Drug stock concentration was 10 mM in 100 DMSO dimethyl sulfoxide . Serial dilutions 1 3 or 1 4 were used to establish the 50 inhibitory dose of TARCEVA and IGF 1R inhibitors. Before dosing drugs were diluted in 100 DMSO and then added to the cells at desired final concentrations in duplicates. The final DMSO concentration was between 0.3 0.5 .

For measuring cell viability Cell Titer Glo assay was used which is available as a kit from Promega. The basis of the assay is a luminescent quantitation of ATP present in a cell culture plate well. In essence the greater the number of viable cells in the well the greater the level of ATP present. The assay utilizes a substrate that binds ATP to produce a luminescent signal which can be read on a luminometer. Unless otherwise noted the manufacturers instructions were followed exactly. Briefly on Day 1 cells were plated in 120 ul of 10 serum containing growth media at a density of 4000 cells well in a white polystyrene 96 well assay plate. On day 2 cells were treated with 15 ul of 10 concentrations of drugs or DMSO alone for a final well volume of 150 ul. After 72 h incubation with the drugs the cells were assayed. Results were calculated as a fraction of the DMSO controlled cells.

To monitor cell apoptosis DNA fragmentation was measured by using a commercially available kit from Roche. Cells were plated in 90 ul of 10 serum containing growth media at a density of 5000 cells well in a 96 well culture plate. On day 2 cells were treated with 10 ul of 10 concentrations of drugs or DMSO alone for a final well volume of 100 ul. After 48 h treatment with the drugs the cells were assayed for DNA fragmentation according to the manufacture instructions. Results were calculated as fold of induction of DNA fragmentation of the DMSO controlled cells. In addition apoptosis markers cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase 3 in the tumor cell lines treated with IGF IR inhibitor alone erlotinib alone or the two drug together were also measured by a immunoblotting.

Modulations of IGF 1R activity and downstream pathways were measured by phosphorylation states of IGF 1R Tyr AKT Ser 473 and MAPK using immunoprecipitation Western blotting. In brief cells were plated in regular media containing 10 FCS overnight. On Day 2 cells were treated with IGF 1R inhibitor alone TARCEVA alone or the two drugs together in the presence or absence of IGF 1 for 2 h. Following rinsing with cold PBS phosphate buffered saline the cells were lysed with cold TGH buffer supplemented with fresh protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Approximately 300 g of the total lysate were incubated with 2 g of a specific anti IGF IR pre coupled to Protein G sepharose overnight at 4 C. with rotating. The Protein G captured antibody protein complexes were washed three times with cold TGH buffer. The samples were boiled and the immunoprecipitates were separated on a 4 12 gradient Tris Glycine gel. Following transfer to nitrocellulose membranes phospho IGF 1R was probed with anti phosphotyrosine antibody pY 20 HRP for 2 h at RT. The bound antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence ECL . The total IGF 1R levels were determined with a specific antibody by direct Western blotting. To monitor influence of the drugs on downstream pathways emanated from IGF 1R and EGFR antibodies specific for phospho PKB Ser473 or phospho p44 42 MAPK Thr202 Tyr204 was used in direct Western blotting. Approximately 20 g of total cell lysates was resolved on 4 12 gradient Tris Glycine gel. Detection was performed using ECL.

Anti tumor efficacy of IGF IR inhibitor plus erlotinib was evaluated using mouse xenograft tumor models derived from H292 H441 H460 GEO and HT29 cells. A fixed once daily dose of 100 mg kg of erlotinib was chosen and was co administered orally with or without compound C at three different doses 25 50 and 75 mg kg . Female CD 1 and athymic nude nu nu CD 1 mice 6 8 wks 22 29 g were obtained from Charles River Laboratories Wilmington Mass. . Animals were allowed to acclimate for a minimum of one week prior to initiation of a study. Throughout the studies animals were allowed sterile rodent chow and water ad libitum and immunocompromised animals were maintained under specific pathogen free conditions. All animal studies were conducted at OSI facilities with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in an American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care AAALAC accredited vivarium and in accordance with the Institute of Laboratory Animal Research Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals NIH Bethesda Md. . Tumor cells were harvested from cell culture flasks during exponential cell growth washed twice with sterile PBS counted and resuspended in PBS to a suitable concentration before s.c. implantation on the right flank of female nu nu CD 1 mice. Tumors were established to 200 50 mmin size before randomization into treatment groups of 8 mice each. Compound C or vehicle 25 mM tartaric acid was administered orally as indicated. Body weights were determined twice weekly along with tumor volume V length width 2 2measurements using Vernier calipers during the study. Tumor growth inhibition TGI was determined by the following formula TGI 1 T T C C 1 C C 100. Tis tumor volume of treated at time t Tis tumor volume of treated at time 0 Cis tumor volume of control at time t and Cis tumor volume of control at time 0. Antitumor activity was defined as a minimum tumor growth inhibition of 50 at the end of treatment. Furthermore we evaluated the effect of drug treatment on tumor growth delay GD or T C value defined as the difference in time days required for the treated tumors T to reach 400 of the initial tumor volume compared with those of the control group C . Cures were excluded from this particular calculation.

Activation of IGF IR Pathways Protects Cells from Growth Inhibition and Apoptosis by TARCEVA in H292 Cells

As shown in TARCEVA an EGFR inhibitor inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in a significant fraction of H292 human non small cell lung carcinoma cell line in culture conditions. This effect could be prevented by concomitant exposure to IGF 1 by providing alternative survival signal pathways . When they were combined together IGF 1R inhibitor potentiated TARCEVA effects and further enhanced activity of inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of cell apoptosis as well as effectively blocking both cell proliferation and cell survival pathways.

Drug Combination of TARCEVA and IGF 1R Inhibitors Achieves Synergistic Effects on Inhibition of Cell Viability in Human Non Small Cell Lung Carcinoma Colorectal Breast and Pancreatic Cancer Cell Lines

Effects on cell viability by either TARCEVA or IGF 1R inhibitor alone or combination of the two drugs were assayed. The data were expressed in three ways 

1. Isobogram of either drug alone or combination of the two drugs. To assess synergistic effects concentration of each drug alone or combination of the two drugs that blocked growth by 50 IC50 were calculated. See Berenbaum M C. . 1981 35 269 335. Assuming zero interaction between the two drugs these points on the axes can be joined by a straight line isobole that indicates combinations of TARCEVA and IGF 1R inhibitors that are isoeffective with either drug alone. The isoeffect is the IC50. When drug combination fall alone this straight line they are assumed to be additive. When the drug combinations are more effective than expected lower concentrations are required to produce the isoeffects IC50 and are considered synergistic. These points will fall below the zero interaction isobole. When drug combinations require higher concentrations than expected to produce the isoeffect they are considered antagonistic and the points will fall above the zero interaction isobole. All of the combination tested all at or below the zero interaction isobole as depicted in .

2. Bar charts illustrating effect of single concentration of TARCEVA or IGF 1R inhibitor alone or combination of the two drugs. No inhibition of cell viability as indicated by the DMSO control is expressed as value of one. 100 inhibition of cell viability will be zero. All of the single drug or the combinations fall below the value of one as depicted by and .

3. Heat maps demonstrating a percentage difference of the combination of drugs over Bliss equation calculated pure additivity based on the effects of drugs as single drugs. Bliss transformation of data was calculated as described in Borisy et al. . 2003 100 7977 82. Positive values represent a percentage effect greater than that of additivity alone and negative numbers represent an effect less than that predicted from the single drug activities. Almost all of the combinations tested have positive numbers as shown in . Alternatively Bliss additivity curves were also generated to illustrate effect of the drug combination. For dose response curves the bliss additivity value was calculated for varying doses of compound C when combined with a constant dose of erlotinib. The dashed line is the BLISS additivity curve and represents the theoretical expectation if the combined effects of erlotinib with PQIP were exactly additive All plots were generated using Prism Graphpad software .

IGF 1R Inhibitor Enhances Anti Tumor Activity of TARCEVA in NSCLC and Colorectal Cancer Xenograft Tumor Models

As shown in and IGF 1R inhibitor enhanced anti tumor efficacy of TARCEVA in both NSCLC and colorectal cancer xenograft models when orally co administering compound C and erlotinib. Tumor growth of H292 exhibited a durable cure in 3 8 mice when erlotinib was co administrated with this IGF IR inhibitor orally once daily. Significant tumor regression was also observed in H441 and GEO tumors in response to the combination treatment and .

The combination of TARCEVA an EGFR inhibitor and IGF1R inhibitors demonstrates synergistic effects on inhibition of cell viability and and promotion of apoptosis A and B in a number of human NSCLC colorectal breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines in culture. This synergy is apparent irrespective of the sensitivities of the cell lines to either drug alone which corresponding to the modulations of downstream pathways namely Ras MAPK and PI3K PKB pathways and . Furthermore the downstream modulations of pAkt and pErk observed in these cells correlated with induction of cell apoptosis and with their responsiveness to erlotinib and IGF IR inhibitor treatment when grown as xenografts in vivo. The combination treatment resulted better anti tumor activity than either single agent alone.

The data presented below demonstrate that co administration of an IGF1R protein kinase inhibitor compound of Formula I with an agent that inhibits serine phosphorylation of IRS1 is effective for treatment of cancers such as colorectal cancer non small cell lung NSCL cancer pancreatic cancer head and neck cancer breast cancer neuroblastoma or ovarian cancer. Accordingly the present invention provides a method for treating tumors or tumor metastases in a patient comprising administering to the patient simultaneously or sequentially a therapeutically effective amount of an agent that inhibits serine phosphorylation of IRS1 and an IGF1R protein kinase inhibitor combination. In one embodiment the tumors or tumor metastases to be treated is non small cell lung NSCL cancer.

Examples of MEK inhibitors that can be used according to the present invention include ARRY 142886 also known as AZD6244 Array BioPharma Astrazeneca PD 184352 also known as CI 1040 Pfizer XL518 Exelixis PD0325901 Pfizer PD 98059 Pfizer and Meki EMD .

The phrase a method of treating or its equivalent when applied to for example cancer refers to a procedure or course of action that is designed to reduce or eliminate the number of cancer cells in an animal or to alleviate the symptoms of a cancer. A method of treating cancer or another proliferative disorder does not necessarily mean that the cancer cells or other disorder will in fact be eliminated that the number of cells or disorder will in fact be reduced or that the symptoms of a cancer or other disorder will in fact be alleviated. Often a method of treating cancer will be performed even with a low likelihood of success but which given the medical history and estimated survival expectancy of an animal is nevertheless deemed an overall beneficial course of action.

The term cancer in an animal refers to the presence of cells possessing characteristics typical of cancer causing cells such as uncontrolled proliferation immortality metastatic potential rapid growth and proliferation rate and certain characteristic morphological features.

As used herein the term patient preferably refers to a human in need of treatment with an IRS1 agent such as an EGFR kinase inhibitor for any purpose and more preferably a human in need of such a treatment to treat cancer or a precancerous condition or lesion. However the term patient can also refer to non human animals preferably mammals such as dogs cats horses cows pigs sheep and non human primates among others that are in need of treatment with an IRS1 agent.

In the context of this invention an effective amount of an agent or therapy is as defined above. A sub therapeutic amount of an agent or therapy is an amount less than the effective amount for that agent or therapy but when combined with an effective or sub therapeutic amount of another agent or therapy can produce a result desired by the physician due to for example synergy in the resulting efficacious effects or reduced side effects.

For purposes of the present invention co administration of and co administering of an IGF1R protein kinase inhibitor compound of Formula I with an IRS1 agent such as an EGFR kinase inhibitor both components referred to hereinafter as the two active agents refer to any administration of the two active agents either separately or together where the two active agents are administered as part of an appropriate dose regimen designed to obtain the benefit of the combination therapy. Thus the two active agents can be administered either as part of the same pharmaceutical composition or in separate pharmaceutical compositions. An IGF1R protein kinase inhibitor compound of Formula I can be administered prior to at the same time as or subsequent to administration of the IRS1 agent or in some combination thereof. Where the IRS1 agent is administered to the patient at repeated intervals e.g. during a standard course of treatment an IGF1R protein kinase inhibitor compound of Formula I can be administered prior to at the same time as or subsequent to each administration of the IRS1 agent or some combination thereof or at different intervals in relation to the IRS1 agent treatment or in a single dose prior to at any time during or subsequent to the course of treatment with the IRS1 agent.
