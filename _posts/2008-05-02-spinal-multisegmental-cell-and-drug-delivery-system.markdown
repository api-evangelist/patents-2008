title: Spinal multisegmental cell and drug delivery system
abstract: Delivery devices and methods related thereto may be used in humans for spinal delivery of cells, drugs or vectors. The patient population may include patients with spinal traumatic injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, spinal ischemia and any other spinal neurodegenerative disorders which will require spinal cell, vector or drug delivery. Unlike conventional methods which require multiple injection sites to make multiple, localized substrate deliveries, the delivery devices and methods of the present invention may allow for multiple substrate delivery locations with homogeneous substrate delivery with a single injection site.

This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application having application No. 60 915 743 filed May 3 2007 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

This invention was made with government support under NS051644 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention generally relates to a drug or cell delivery system and more specifically to a drug or cell delivery system for multisegmental injection of substrate and or cells into an animal or human.

Currently used devices employ multiple vertical spinal cord injections to deliver cells into multiple spinal cord segments. Feron et al. Brain 2005 128 2951 2960. The risk of secondary spinal cord injury resulting from multiple vertical injections is high as it can lead to a mechanical trauma of otherwise intact and functional spinal cord tissue.

Previous devices developed for multiple depositions of cells into brain tissue have used plastic injection cannulas which bends after exiting the guide needle and therefore do not permit deposition of the injectate in a single plane if measured against the guide needle . See of Brecknell and Fawcett Experimental Neurology 1996 138 338 343.

The second type of device which was developed for brain injections describes the use of a rigid type of guide needle which can hold a specific angle shape and can be used for guided placement of flexible injection needle or possibly for injections. See page 1498 Material and Methods section of Cunningham et al. Neurosurgery 2004 54 1497 1507.

As can be seen there is a need for apparatus and methods for delivering a substrate into the spinal cord of a mammal while minimizing the number of required injection sites.

In one aspect of the present invention a device for the delivery of a substrate into a spinal cord comprises a guide needle having an inside diameter an injection needle fitting into the inside diameter of the guide needle a stepping motor advancing the injection needle into and within the spinal cord and a chamber containing the substrate or cells in fluid communication with the injection needle.

In another aspect of the present invention a method for multisegmental delivery of a substrate or cells into a spinal cord comprises advancing a guide needle into the spinal cord advancing an injection needle through the guide needle into the spinal cord and withdrawing the injection needle while delivering the substrate or cells into the spinal cord.

In a further aspect of the present invention a method for homogenous delivery of a substance into a spinal cord comprises advancing a guide needle into spinal parenchyma at an angle of about 45 degrees advancing an injection needle through the guide needle horizontally into spinal parenchyma initiating delivery of the substance or cells after the injection needle is fully inserted into spinal parenchyma up to 1 3 inches and continuing delivery of the substance or cells while the needle is withdrawn from spinal parenchyma using a computer controlled stepping motor.

The following detailed description is of the best currently contemplated modes of carrying out the invention. The description is not to be taken in a limiting sense but is made merely for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the invention since the scope of the invention is best defined by the appended claims.

As used herein the term substrate refers to any injectable substance including but not limited to cells drugs viruses plasmids growth factors and the like. The substrate may any suitable form of matter including a liquid a suspension a gel an encapsulated solid a nanoparticle suspension a slow or extended release polymer composition and the like.

As used herein the term mammal refers to any class of warm blooded higher vertebrates that includes humans.

As used herein the term horizontal refers to a direction of the spinal column when a subject is lying supine or prone. In other words horizontal may be described as along the long axis of the spine. The term vertical refers to a direction from about 45 degrees to about 90 degrees relative to the horizontal direction.

Broadly the present invention may permit a multisegmental injection of cells or any diffusible substances such as drugs growth factors or any other injectable substance into spinal cord in large animal species and in humans. The present invention may provide methods and apparatus so that one vertical spinal cord puncture may be required to permit a multisegmental up to 4 6 spinal segments delivery of a substrate.

Conventional devices employ multiple vertical spinal cord injections to deliver cells drugs vectors or the like into spinal cord parenchyma. In a typical setting multiple injections up to several hundred are required to achieve a satisfactory cell drug or vector delivery to multiple spinal segments Feron et al. Brain 2005 128 2951 2960. . The device of the present invention after exiting the guide needle the injection needle may retain a fixed angle thus permitting a well controlled placement in a given plane over 1 3 inches from the tip of the guide needle.

The device of the present invention may permit the number of vertical injections to be reduced to about less than 20 typically less than 10 and even more typically to within a range of about 6 to 10. In addition because of a continuous cell delivery during the process of the needle withdrawal a much more homogeneous distribution of substrate can be achieved in the multiple spinal cord segments. The device of the present invention may use a stepping motor to withdraw the needle thus permitting a homogenous injectate delivery over the whole injection trajectory.

Referring to a device of the present invention may include two separate elements a guide needle and an injection needle . The guide needle may be from about 27 to about 30 gauge typically from about 100 to about 400 micrometers in diameter and may be made from stainless steel or other non corrosive material. The guide needle may be from about 2 to about 4 inches long. The lower 2 3 inches of the needle may have a bend the bend curving circularly at an angle of about 45 degrees. The upper 3 4 inches of the needle may be attached firmly to a micromanipulator which may be used to place the guide needle into a specific spinal cord region localized in the gray or white matter.

The injection needle may be made of stainless steel polycarbonate synthetic quartz polymer or other flexible material tubing between about 34 to about 30 gauge and may be from about 5 to about 7 inches long. One end of the needle internal end may be advanced into the spinal cord tissue e.g. the gray matter through the guide needle and used for injection of a substrate such as cells or any diffusible substances see . The other end i.e. external end about 1 2 inches may be attached to a stepping motor . The stepping motor may be used for advancement of the injection needle into spinal parenchyma e.g. gray matter through the guide needle . The external end of the injection needle may be connected to a syringe using polyethylene tubing . Injections may be performed by using a digital microinjector not shown .

Referring now to C and D the guide needle may be advanced into spinal parenchyma e.g. gray matter through the dorsal horn e.g. spinal segment number of the spinal cord at an injection angle not shown of about a 45 degree angle relative to horizontal. The tip not shown of the guide needle may be targeted into the spinal regions to be injected with substrate . The tip of the guide needle may have a bend at an angle of about 45 degrees which along with the injection angle may result in the tip of the guide needle pointing in a substantially horizontal direction along the spinal cord when inserted into a subject. The bend in the tip may be formed along the guide needle within the last 0.5 inches thereof typically within the last 0.1 0.2 inch thereof. The spinal region may be gray matter dorsal horn intermediate zone or ventral horn or any region of the white matter.

After positioning of the guide needle the injection needle may be advanced horizontally into spinal parenchyma e.g. gray matter in dorso caudal or caudo rostral direction. The distance of the injection needle advancement can be up to about 1 to about 3 inches.

After the targeted spinal segment is reached with the tip internal end of the injection needle the injection of substrate may be initiated using for example a microinjector not shown . During the course of the injection the injection needle may be gradually withdrawn as shown by arrow thereby permitting a homogenous multisegmental delivery of substrate into the targeted areas spinal segments 1 4 as shown in .

Referring to there is shown a flow chart of a method for multisegmental delivery of a substance e.g. substrate into a spinal cord e.g. spinal cord . The method may include a step of advancing a guide needle e.g. guide needle into spinal parenchyma e.g. gray matter . The guide needle may be bent at the injection end at an angle of about 45 degrees. The method may include a further step of advancing an injection needle e.g. injection needle through the guide needle to exit the guide needle horizontally into spinal parenchyma. The injection needle may be injected through one or several spinal segments. The method may also include a step of withdrawing the injection needle while delivering the substance into the spinal cord. This withdrawal during delivery may provide not only multisegmental delivery of the substance but may also provide for a homogenous delivery of the substance. Conventional methods may fail to provide the multisegmental delivery or the homogenous delivery of the substance into the spinal column.

It should be understood of course that the foregoing relates to exemplary embodiments of the invention and that modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the following claims.
