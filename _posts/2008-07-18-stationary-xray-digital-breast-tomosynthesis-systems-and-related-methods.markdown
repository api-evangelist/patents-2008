The presently disclosed subject matter claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60 961 175 filed Jul. 19 2007 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

This presently disclosed subject matter was made with U.S. Government support under Grant No. US4CA119343 awarded by the National Cancer Institute. Thus the U.S. Government has certain rights in the presently disclosed subject matter.

The subject matter described herein relates to x ray radiography. More specifically the subject matter describes stationary x ray digital breast tomosynthesis systems and related methods.

Mammography is currently the most effective screening and diagnostic tool for early detection of breast cancer and has been attributed to the recent reduction of breast cancer mortality rate. However the nature of the two dimensional mammogram makes it difficult to distinguish a cancer from overlying breast tissues and the interpretation can be variable among radiologists. A higher rate of false positive and false negative test results exist because the dense tissues interfere with the identification of abnormalities associated with tumors. Digital breast tomosynthesis DBT is a three dimensional imaging technique that is designed to overcome this problem. It is a limited angle tomography technique that provides reconstruction planes in the breast using projection images from a limited angular range.

Several prototype DBT scanners have been manufactured by commercial vendors. The system designs are based on a full field digital mammography FFDM unit. A mammography x ray tube is used to collect the projection images by moving 10 50 degrees around the object. The reported total scanning time is 7 40 seconds depending on the number of views and the thickness of the breast which is much longer than that of the regular mammography. The long imaging time can cause patient motion blur which degrades image quality and can make patients uncomfortable. Further the power of the x ray source gantry rotating speed and detector frame rate limit the scanning speed of the current DBT systems.

DBT systems utilize the standard mammography x ray tube with about a 300 m x ray focal spot size. Due to the gantry rotation and mechanical instability the effective focal spot size during image acquisition is larger than the static value which degrades the image resolution. Two gantry rotation modes have been developed. One commercially available system uses a stop and shoot technique. The gantry makes a full stop before taking each projection image. Acceleration deceleration can cause mechanical instability of the system. A continuous rotation mode is used in other commercially available systems. The gantry keeps a constant rotation speed during the whole imaging process. In this case the x ray focal spot size is enlarged along the motion direction. The value of the enlargement depends on the rotation speed and the exposure time. It has been reported that the x ray focal spot moves about 1 mm in a typical scan. This does not leave room for further reduction of the total scanning time which will require a faster gantry rotation and a larger focal spot blurring.

It would be beneficial to provide x ray imaging systems and methods having reduced data collection times and improvements for patient comfort. One or more such improvements can enable new applications for x ray imaging of breast tissue as well as other objects. Accordingly it is desirable to provide x ray imaging systems and methods having one or more of these improvements.

In addition current clinical mammography scanners use polychromatic x ray radiation with slight energy filtering. It is known that monochromatic and quasi monochromatic radiation provides better imaging quality and can potentially reduce the imaging dose. Currently there is no effective way however to generate monochromatic or quasi monochromatic radiation in a clinical environment that can provide sufficient x ray photo flux. Accordingly it is desirable to provide x ray imaging systems and methods that can perform monochromatic or quasi monochromatic imaging in a clinically acceptable scanning speed.

It is an object of the presently disclosed subject matter to provide novel stationary x ray digital breast tomosynthesis systems and related methods.

An object of the presently disclosed subject matter having been stated hereinabove and which is achieved in whole or in part by the presently disclosed subject matter other objects will become evident as the description proceeds when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings described hereinbelow.

The subject matter disclosed herein is directed to multi beam field emission x ray MBFEX also referred to as multi pixel field emission x ray systems and techniques that can utilize a plurality of field emission x ray sources an x ray detector and projection image reconstruction techniques. Particularly the systems and techniques disclosed herein according to one aspect can be applied to x ray digital tomosynthesis. In accordance with one embodiment a plurality of field emission x ray sources can irradiate a location for positioning an object to be imaged with x ray beams for generating projection images of the object. An x ray detector can detect the projection images of the object. A projection image reconstruction function can reconstruct tomography images of the object based on the projection images of the object. The subject matter disclosed herein enables increased scanning speed a simplification of system design and image quality enhancements.

In one application the subject matter disclosed herein can be a stationary digital breast tomosynthesis DBT system that utilizes a carbon nanotube based MBFEX system. The MBFEX system can include an array of individually programmable x ray pixels that can be substantially evenly placed to cover a wide field of view. Projection images can be acquired by electronically switching on and off the individual x ray pixels without mechanical motion of any of the x ray source the detector or the object.

In one embodiment of the subject matter described herein projection images of an object can be collected sequentially one at a time from different viewing angles by electronically switching on and off individual x ray source pixels. The x ray source pixels can be spatially distributed. Each pixel can be switched on for a predetermined time and a predetermined current to deliver a predetermined amount of dosage to the object. The transmitted x ray intensity from a particular x ray source pixel can be detected and recorded by an x ray detector. The spacing between the x ray beam pixels and the number of pixels can be varied to provide angular coverage and the number of projection images desired. The projection images collected from different viewing angles can be processed to reconstruct tomography images of the object to reveal the internal structure of the object. In one example the x ray source can include a total of between about ten and one hundred x ray focal spots e.g. twenty five 25 x ray source pixels positioned along an arc that can cover a viewing range of between about 10 and 100 degrees e.g. 30 50 degree viewing range . The focal spots define a plane that is substantially perpendicular to an imaging plane of the x ray detector.

In one embodiment of the subject matter described herein one or a plurality of monochromators can be used to generate monochromatic x ray radiation for imaging an object. Such monochromatic x ray radiation can be produced using Bragg diffraction. Quasi monochromatic x ray beams can be generated by placing filters in front of an x ray window that receives polychromatic x ray radiation. By selecting the filtering material and thickness of the material quasi monochromatic radiation with a narrow energy window can be produced. This however typically includes the use of 200to 500value layer filtering material. This means that 99.5 to 99.8 of the x ray intensity is attenuated by the filter. The low x ray flux has prevented the use of monochromatic x ray radiation for clinical imaging.

In one example of monochromatic x ray radiation the generated monochromatic x ray radiation can be utilized for imaging a breast. An advantage of monochromatic and quasi monochromatic x ray radiation includes improved imaging quality at reduced x ray dose which is important for breast imaging. The subject matter described herein can enable physicians to image human breasts using quasi monochromatic x ray radiation at an imaging speed that is comparable to commercially available DBT scanners with polychromatic x ray radiation.

One technique to overcome the obstacles of low flux and therefore long imaging time is to combine multi beam field emission x ray source with multiplexing x ray imaging. Cone beam quasi monochromatic radiation can be produced by heavy filtering. The pixilated and spatially distributed MBFEX source can generate x ray beams from multiple projection angles without mechanical motion. A stationary DBT scanner operating in the sequential scanning mode can provide a full scan of 25 views using 85 mAs total dose with a speed that is a factor of 10 faster than the C arm based DBT scanners at a comparable dose. Experiments have also shown that the parallel multiplexing imaging process provides a factor of N 2 N number of x ray pixels increase of the imaging speed comparing to the conventional serial imaging technique used for tomography. The combination of the gains from stationary design and multiplexing described herein about 100 can compensate for the loss of x ray flux due to the use of heavy filtering 100value layer which enables the qM DBT scanner to operate at a comparable scanning time as commercially available C arm based system but with a better imaging quality and a reduced imaging dose.

As referred to herein the term nano structured or nanostructure material can designate materials including nanoparticles with particle sizes less than 100 nm such as nanotubes e.g. carbon nanotubes . These types of materials have been shown to exhibit certain properties that have raised interest in a variety of applications.

As referred to herein the term multi beam x ray source can designate devices that can simultaneously or sequentially generate multiple x ray beams For example the multi beam x ray source can include a field emission based multi beam x ray source having electron field emitters. The electron field emitters can include nano structured materials based materials.

X ray sources XS can be positioned for directing x ray beams XB towards a location or position P designated by broken lines at which object O can be placed. The x ray beams can be directed towards position P from several different angles. Further x ray sources XS x ray detector XD and position P are positioned such that the generated projection images are detected by x ray detector XD. X ray sources XS are positioned along a substantially straight line formed by x ray generating device XGD such that the generated x ray beams are directed substantially towards position P and can pass through the area within position P. The line can be parallel to an imaging plane of the x ray detector. As described in further detail below x ray sources XS can be arranged in any suitable position such that the x ray beams are directed substantially towards position P and the projection images are detected by x ray detector XD. The x ray sources and x ray detector can be stationary with respect to one another during irradiation of an object by the x ray sources and detection of the projection images by the x ray detector. The x ray sources can be controlled for sequential activation one at a time for a predetermined dwell time and predetermined x ray dose.

After passing through object O at position P x ray beams XB can be detected by x ray detector XD. X ray detector XD can be a high frame rate digital area x ray detector configured to continuously capture x ray beams XB. After all or at least a portion of x ray beams XB are collected and stored as x ray signal data in a memory a projection image reconstruction function PIRF can reconstruct tomography images of object O based on the projection images of the object O.

The tomography images can be constructed by using a suitable technique to obtain multi projection images of an object from multiple x ray sources using a single detector. Common techniques include shift and add filtered back projection ordered subsets convex maximum likelihood etc.

According to another aspect of the subject matter disclosed herein x ray sources can be positioned along an arc defined by the x ray generating device. The arc can define a plane that can be substantially perpendicular to an imaging plane of the x ray detector. is a schematic diagram of a MBFEX system generally designated having x ray sources XS positioned along a linear line according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. Referring to x ray sources XS can be positioned at least substantially along a linear line formed by x ray generating device XGD. X ray sources XS can be positioned for directing x ray beams XB towards and through position P at which object O can be placed. The x ray beams can be directed to position P from several different angles. Further x ray sources XS x ray detector XD and position P can be positioned such that the generated projection images are detected by x ray detector XD. After passing through object O at position P x ray beams XB can be detected by x ray detector XD. After all or at least a portion of x ray beams XB are collected and stored as x ray signal data in a memory a projection image reconstruction function PIRF can reconstruct tomography images of object O based on the projection images of the object O.

According to another aspect of the subject matter disclosed herein x ray sources can include focal spots positioned along a two dimensional plane or matrix on an x ray anode. is a schematic diagram of a MBFEX system generally designated having x ray sources XS positioned along a two dimensional plane according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. Referring to x ray sources XS can be positioned substantially along a two dimensional plane formed by x ray generating device XGD. X ray sources XS can be positioned for directing x ray beams XB towards and through position P at which object O can be placed. The x ray beams can be directed to position P from several different angles. Further x ray sources XS x ray detector XD and position P are positioned such that the generated projection images are detected by x ray detector XD. After passing through object O at position P x ray beams XB can be detected by x ray detector XD. After all or at least a portion of x ray beams XB are collected and stored as x ray signal data in a memory a projection image reconstruction function PIRF can reconstruct tomography images of object O based on the projection images of the object O.

According to another aspect of the subject matter disclosed herein x ray sources can be positioned along a line evenly spaced and angled for directing x ray beams towards an object. is a schematic diagram of a MBFEX system generally designated having x ray sources XS positioned along a line evenly spaced and angled for directing x ray beams towards an object according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. Referring to x ray sources XS can be gated carbon nanotube emitting pixels positioned substantially along a two dimensional plane formed by x ray generating device XGD. In this example the x ray generating device includes twenty five 25 x ray sources in total although the x ray generating device can alternatively include any suitable number of x ray sources more or less even that twenty five in number.

The x ray source can be housed in a vacuum chamber having a 30 m thick molybdenum Mo window. The window can function as a radiation filter. Each pixel can comprise a carbon nanotube cathode a gate electrode to extract the electrons and a set of electron focusing lenses e.g. Einzel type electrostatic focusing lenses to focus the field emitted electrons to a small area focal spot on the target. The focal spots can be substantially the same size. The sizes of the focal spots and or the x ray flux generated by the x ray sources can be adjusted by the controller. Alternatively the focal spots can range between about 0.05 mm and 2 mm in size. The system is designed for an isotropic 0.2 0.2 mm effective focal spot size for each x ray source pixel. The individual focal spot size can be adjusted by adjusting the electrical potentials of the focusing electrodes. To minimize the current fluctuation and delay and to reduce pixel to pixel variation an electrical compensation loop can be incorporated to automatically adjust the gate voltage to maintain a constant pre set emission current. The area of the carbon nanotube cathode can be selected such that a peak x ray tube current of about 10 mA can be obtained with the effective focal spot size of 0.2 0.2 mm. A higher x ray peak current of 50 100 mA can be obtained by increasing the carbon nanotube area and the focal spot size.

X ray sources XS can be positioned for directing x ray beams XB towards position P at which object O is placed. The x ray beams can be directed towards and through position P from several different angles. Further x ray sources XS x ray detector XD and position P are positioned such that the generated projection images are detected by x ray detector XD. To collect the projection images of object O from different angles for tomosynthesis controller CTR can sequentially activate an array of electron emitting pixels as described in further detail below which are spatially distributed over a relatively large area. X ray sources XS are positioned such that the generated x ray beams are directed at least substantially to position P. Each x ray source XS can include a field emitter operable to generate an electron beam and operable to direct the electron beam to a focal point of a target. The emitted electron beam can be accelerated to the target where a scanning x ray beam originates for different points over a large area of the target. The controller CTR can further vary the intensity of the x ray radiation based on the distance between x ray source XS and object O such that the x ray dose delivered to object O from every viewing angle is the same.

X ray sources XS can be positioned such that x ray generating device XGD provides a substantially even 2 degree angular spacing between the x ray focal spots at a source to detector distance of about 64.52 cm. The position and the orientation of the individual x ray target can be such that the center axis of a generated x ray cone beam goes through an iso center OC which can either be a location on object O to be imaged or a point on x ray detector XD. The cone shaped x ray beams can have substantially the same x ray intensity distribution on the object. Further x ray sources can produce x ray radiation having different energy spectra.

After passing through object O at position P x ray beams XB can be detected by x ray detector XD. After all or at least a portion of x ray beams XB are collected and stored as x ray signal data in a memory a projection image reconstruction function PIRF can reconstruct tomography images of object O based on the projection images of the object O.

In system the x ray beam originating from a focal point can be generated by the electron beam from a corresponding pixel on a cathode. A scanning x ray beam can be generated by sequentially activating individual pixels. A constant high DC voltage about 0 100 KVp can be applied between the x ray anode and the gate electrode. A variable DC voltage about 0 2 kV can be applied on the gate electrode. Alternatively the x ray anodes can be configured at different voltages to produce x ray radiation with multiple energies. For example for a system having 25 x ray sources 12 anodes can be configured at low voltage and 13 anodes can be configured at high voltage. Such a configuration enables the system for dual energy imaging.

Switching on and off the individual emitting pixel can be effected by an electronic circuit e.g. a MOSFET circuit connected to the cathode. The electronic circuit can be used to individually control the x ray intensities from the different x ray focal spots XS e.g. x ray sources XS and XS such that they can either be the same or be modulated to deliver a desired intensity or intensity distribution on object O to be imaged. An x ray beam can be produced from a corresponding focal point when the electron beam bombards the anode surface of the target. To generate a scanning beam a pulsed voltage with a predetermined pulse width can be scanned across the individual MOSFETs. At each point the channel can be opened to generate an electron beam from the pixel which can lead to the generation of an x ray beam from the corresponding focal point on the target. To minimize the fluctuation of the x ray flux the cathode can be operated at a constant current mode. The gate voltage can be adjusted automatically to maintain the emission current and thus x ray flux from each pixel to within a desired level.

The 25 x ray source pixels of x ray generating device XGD can span a distance of 57.45 cm from end to end. At a source to object distance of 64.52 cm the device provides 48 degree coverage with a substantially even 2 degree angular spacing between adjacent pixels. The linear spacing between adjacent x ray source pixels can vary to provide even angular spacing. The x ray beams can be collimated to a 23.04 cm field of view FOV at the phantom plane. If the x ray source pixels are arranged in a linear line parallel to the detector plane rather than an arc the pixel to source distance can vary from pixel to pixel. In one option to compensate this variation in x ray beam traveling distance the x ray tube current from each pixel can be individually adjusted such that the flux at the phantom surface remains the same. In another solution the image intensities can be normalized in the reconstruction process. The phantom can be placed on a stage for positioning with a 2.54 cm air gap between the detector and the phantom.

At block controller CTR can control x ray detector XD to acquire the iimage. Particularly x ray detector XD can acquire the projection image of object O generated by the ix ray source s . Controller CTR can determine whether acquisition of images from all i groups of x ray sources has been completed block . If it is determined that images have not been acquired from all i groups of x ray sources controller CTR can increment variable i by 1 block and the process can proceed to block to acquire images from the remaining groups of x ray sources.

If it is determined that images have been acquired from all i groups of x ray sources projection image reconstruction function PIRF can reconstruct tomography images of object O based on the projection images of the object block . At block a display of computer COM can display the reconstructed slice images of object O.

Referring to at block controller CTR of system can initiate the process and set variable i to 1. Variable i represents the iteration number of the process. At block controller CTR can turn on x ray sources XS corresponding to the ipixels. Particularly one or more x ray sources XS can correspond to an igroup of x ray sources. As described in further detail below the process sequences through groups of i x ray sources until the entirety of x ray sources have been turned on and their x ray beams XB detected. In one embodiment controller CTR can control the x ray sources to generate multiplexed x ray beams which can be demultiplexed for image reconstruction as described below.

At block controller CTR can control x ray detector XD to acquire the iimage. Particularly x ray detector XD can acquire the projection image of object O generated by the ix ray source s . Controller CTR can determine whether acquisition of images from all i groups of x ray sources has been completed block . If it is determined that images have not been acquired from all i groups of x ray sources controller CTR can increment variable i by 1 block and the process can proceed to block to acquire images from the remaining groups of x ray sources.

After image acquisition projection image reconstruction function PIRF can apply tomosynthesis reconstruction block and display the reconstructed images via the display of computer COM block . Alternatively if the x ray beams were multiplexed projection image reconstruction function PIRF can demultiplex the images block apply tomosynthesis reconstruction block and display the reconstructed images via the display of computer COM block .

Any suitable multiplexing imaging technique can be utilized in a system in accordance with the subject matter described herein. In this imaging mode all or a sub group of x ray source pixels can be switched on simultaneously to illuminate the object. One example of a multiplexing technique includes a frequency division multiplexing. By using a multiplexing technique the total image collection time can be significantly increased.

In one example of a multiplexing technique an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing technique can be utilized. In this example pulsed x ray signals are generated and each x ray beam can have a unique pulse width and repetition rate. Further in this example the detector records the transmitted x ray intensity from the on x ray pixels as a function of time. The recorded image is then de multiplexed in the frequency domain to obtain the projection images from the individual pixels.

In another example of a multiplexing technique a binary multiplexing technique can be utilized. An example of a binary multiplexing technique is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 804 897 titled Methods Systems and Computer Program Products for Binary Multiplexing X Ray Radiography the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and which is commonly assigned to the same entities as the present patent application. In this example a sub set of the x ray beams is switched on sequentially. The individual projection images are obtained by a linear combination of the composite images from the sub sets.

X ray sources may be triggered sequentially and projection images acquired accordingly. is a timing diagram of a detector trigger and x ray source pixel triggers according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. In this example the system includes 25 x ray source pixels. The signals represent control signals generated by a controller for controlling the x ray sources and detector. X ray radiation is on when a trigger signal is at 5 V. The exposure time is Tfor each pixel which is the same as the integration time Tof the detector. The detector readout is triggered by the rising edge of the signal. The time to capture one image is represented by T. The total scan time is 25 T T .

In accordance with the subject matter described herein the field emission x ray sources can each include a field emission cathode a gate electrode that extracts electrons from the cathode when an electrical field is applied between the gate and the cathode a focusing unit that focuses the field emitted electrons to a defined focal area on an anode and the anode that produces the x ray radiation when it is bombarded by the electron beam. The field emission cathode can includes carbon nanotubes nanowires and or microfabricated tips. The gate electrodes can be either controlled individually or connected electrically.

For purposes of experimentation one embodiment of a system in accordance with the subject matter disclosed herein was constructed. is an image of a MBFEX system generally designated in accordance with the subject matter disclosed herein. Referring to system includes x ray detector XD x ray generating device XGD and a stage S for positioning of a phantom PH to be imaged. X ray generating device XGD includes a carbon nanotube MBFEX source. X ray detector XD is a flat panel x ray detector. System includes a control unit and a computer work station. X ray detector XD can be a flat panel detector. The field of view can be about 19.5 cm 24.4 cm which can ensure a full image of a breast. With a 127 m pixel pitch the total array size is 1536 1920. The detector can run under non binning mode and 2 2 binning mode. Referring again to in the user synchronization mode the rising edge of a continuous TTL signal can trigger readout of the detector. The imaging time is determined by the integration window Tand the detector readout time T. Tis controllable through the triggering signal. X ray radiation is delivered within the integration window T and the radiation period is denoted as T. The readout time Tdepends on the acquisition mode. For the normal 2 2 binning modes the readout time is 128 ms and 32 ms respectively. In this example the projection images are taken sequentially.

System includes a field emission x ray source array. The construction of the 25 x ray source pixels is substantially identical. are perspective and schematic diagram views respectively of an x ray source XS according to an embodiment of the subject matter disclosed herein. Referring to x ray source XS can include an electron field emitter FE for emitting electrons. Electron field emitter FE can comprise one or more carbon nanotubes and or other suitable electron field emission materials. Electron field emitter FE can be attached to a surface of a cathode C conductive or contact line or other suitable conductive material.

Electron field emitter FE can be controlled by a suitable controller such as controller CTR shown in including MOSFET circuitry. The controller can control voltage sources to apply voltage between electron field emitter FE and a gate electrode GE to generate electric fields for extracting electrons from electron field emitter FE to thereby produce an electron beam EB. The controller can operate MOSFET circuitry for individually controlling electron beam emission by x ray sources. The drains of the MOSFETs can be connected to cathode C for controlling electron beam emission by emitter FE. The MOSFETs can be turned on and off by the application of high signal e.g. 5 V and a low signal e.g. 0 V to the gates of the MOSFET. When a high signal is applied to the gate of a MOSFET a drain to source channel of the transistor is turned on to apply a voltage difference between cathode C and gate electrode GE. A voltage difference exceeding a threshold can generate an electric field between cathode C and gate electrode GE such that electrons are extracted from electron field emitter FE. Conversely when a low voltage e.g. 0 V is applied to the gate of a MOSFET a drain to source channel is turned off such that the voltage at emitter FE is electrically floating and the voltage difference between cathode C and gate electrode GE cannot generate an electric field of sufficient strength to extract electrons from emitter FE.

Cathode C can be grounded and other electrodes maintained at constant voltages during imaging acquisition. The gate voltage determines the x ray tube current. Below a threshold there is no current and the current increases exponentially with gate voltage above the threshold. In one example each x ray pixel can provide a tube current of between 0.1 and 1 mA at 40 kVp. The controller is operable to apply voltage pulses of different frequencies to the gates of the MOSFET.

Further x ray source XS can include an anode A having a focus spot for bombardment by electron beam EB. A voltage difference can be applied between anode A and gate electrode GE such that a field is generated for accelerating electrons emitted by electron field emitter FE toward a target structure TS of anode A. The target structure can produce x ray beams having a predetermined signal upon bombardment by electron beam EB. X ray source XS can include focusing electrodes FEL and FEL for focusing electrons extracted from electron field emitter FE on target structure TS and thus reduce the size of electron beam EB. Focusing electrodes FEL and FEL can be controlled by application of voltages to the focusing electrodes by a voltage source. The voltage applied to the focusing electrodes controls the electron trajectory. The gate voltage can be varied depending on required flux.

Electron field emitter FE and gate electrode GE can be contained within a vacuum chamber with a sealed interior at about 10Torr pressure. The interior of the vacuum chamber can be evacuated to achieve a desired interior pressure. X ray radiation can travel from the interior of the vacuum chamber to its exterior through an x ray permeable portion or window. In one example the x ray permeable portion or window can be a beryllium Be or molybdenum Mo window. The molybdenum anode and filter combination can be used for breast imaging among other applications. Up to a 40 keV high voltage can be applied on anode A. Anode A can be suitably shaped and or angled such that the generated x ray beams are transmitted toward an object from a plurality of different viewing angles. The targeted performance for the source is that each x ray source pixel can provide a 10 mA peak current at 200 m 200 m effective focal spot size. Alternatively the energy filter can comprise Cerium and the voltage applied on anode A can be in the range of 60 80 kV.

To reconstruct slice images an iterative ordered subset convex OSC technique can be used by the reconstruction function based on a maximum likelihood model. The reconstruction technique applies a sharing method to convert all projections images to a common frame of reference and then uses a pre computed cone beam model to project and back project in the common frame. To reduce the computation load non cubic voxels are reconstructed. This technique has been verified on both simulated data and breast phantom images measured from a field emission x ray source array with a limited number of pixels.

Advantages of a system in accordance with the subject matter disclosed herein over commercially available systems include 1 the total spot size of system is 200 m while the values of other systems are 300 m or larger 2 the stationary design provides less gantry vibration by eliminating the mechanical movement and 3 the exposure time matches the detector integration window. The targeted total scan time 8.8 s in binning mode and 11.2 s in full resolution mode 25 viewing angles is shorter which can be further reduced by increasing the x ray tube current which requires relaxing of the focal spot size.

The energy spectrum of the x ray source of system was measured at 28 keV using a Si pin photodiode detector. The energy filters used can be selected such that the x ray radiation from each of the x ray focal spots have the same energy spectrum. The spectrum is consistent when measured at different locations within the field of view and from different x ray source pixels. The experimentally measured energy spectrum of system at 28 keV is shown in the graph of . The results shown in agree well with a typically Mo Mo x ray spectrum. Two molybdenum characteristic peaks one at 17.5 keV and the other at 19.6 keV can be recognized in the graph. Alternatively the energy filters can be varied such that energy spectra from the x ray focal spots can be individually controlled.

In this experiment nine of the pixels of system shown in have been characterized. Due to the variation in the carbon nanotube cathodes the gate voltages required to obtain the same current are different. As a reference the voltages vary from 925 V to 1465 V for 1 mA tube current. Table 2 shows the gate voltage and standard deviation of current for the nine pixels as obtained by this experiment.

In this experiment the designed x ray focal spot size is about 200 200 m for all 25 x ray sources. The actual values were measured following the European standard EN12543 5. A customized cross wire phantom made of 1 mm tungsten wire was fabricated to measure the focal spot size along two orthogonal directions simultaneously. The phantom was placed close to the x ray source to obtain the large magnification factor. The voltages applied to the two focusing electrodes were first varied to optimize the focal spot size. It was found that the optimal focal spot size is achieved when the two focusing electrodes are at 500 V and 1600 V respectively. A typical projection image of the cross phantom is shown in . is a graph showing the line profiles of the two wires where the X axis is the direction of the x ray source array and the Y axis is perpendicular to the array.

Tomosynthesis reconstruction requires precise system geometry parameters. An analytic method was applied based on identification of ellipse parameters for the geometry calibration which was first established for cone beam CT calibration. A phantom with two point objects with known distance was machined. The geometry parameters of the 25 x ray sources were individually calibrated. Six projection images of the phantom 60 degree rotation in between were acquired for each pixel. The traces of the two balls form two ellipses on the detector plane. The parameters including the source to detector distance and x ray source offset values on the detector plane can be further calculated based on these elliptical curves. The source to detector distance is calculated to be 69.3 cm with 2 mm uncertainty. The distances between the x ray sources are also calculated. The results agree with the design values within 1 mm uncertainty.

In one embodiment an anti scattering component can be positioned between the x ray detector and the location for positioning the object. In particular one dimensional or two dimensional anti scattering grids can be made to utilize the advantage of linear MBFEX. For instance in the case of a two dimensional grid the anti scattering component can be adjusted based on a position of one or more of the x ray sources being activated. Alternatively in the case of a one dimensional anti scattering grid the grid lines can run in either parallel or perpendicular to the linear arc direction of the MBFEX. The grid geometry can be tailored to enable fan beam reconstruction to enhance the tomographic image quality and increase the reconstruction speed.

Using such an anti scattering component a cone beam x ray source can be used to produce fan beam reconstructed tomography images of an object. For example referring again to a plurality of stationary field emission x ray sources XS can be provided. X ray sources XS can be spatially distributed in a substantially linear array e.g. x ray generating device XGD . The object O can then be irradiated with x ray cone beams produced by x ray sources XS to generate two dimensional projection images of object O. A linear anti scattering grid AS can be placed between object O and detector XD to reduce scatter of the x ray cone beams. Two dimensional projection images of object O can be detected and the two dimensional projection images can be divided into groups of one dimensional data. These groups of one dimensional data can be collected from all of the different x ray sources XS and a fan beam reconstruction can be used to reconstruct slice images of object O from the groups of one dimensional data. The slice images can be merged together to form a three dimensional image of object O.

It will be understood that various details of the presently disclosed subject matter may be changed without departing from the scope of the presently disclosed subject matter. Furthermore the foregoing description is for the purpose of illustration only and not for the purpose of limitation.
