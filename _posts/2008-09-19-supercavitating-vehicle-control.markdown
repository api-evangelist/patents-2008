title: Supercavitating vehicle control
abstract: A control system for a supercavitating vehicle includes a set of winglets for rapid maneuverability and a segmented ring wing for fine stabilization control. The winglets and ring wing extend from an aft portion of the vehicle. The winglets are supported by a strut attached to the vehicle. The angle of attack of each winglet into the water adjacent the cavity is controlled by a winglet actuator. The winglet assembly may be extended into the water or retracted to be completely within the cavity by means of a spring-loaded actuated mount. The segmented ring wing is controlled by a ring actuator. The ring actuator may be used to control the angle of attack of the ring wing. Alternately, or in combination, the flow over the ring wing may be neutralized by using the cavitator of the vehicle to globally enlarge the cavity and thus limit the flow.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The present invention relates to vehicle control systems and methods and more specifically to systems and methods for controlling a trajectory of a supercavitating vehicle.

There exists a need for reducing drag in underwater vehicles such as torpedoes so as to enhance their speed reliability and stealthy operation. For a nominally streamlined fully wetted underwater vehicle 80 of the overall drag is skin friction drag. The remaining drag is pressure or blockage drag.

Some investigations into reducing the drag of high speed underwater vehicles have focused attention on supercavitating underwater vehicles. For supercavitation sufficient energy is put into the water to vaporize a given volume of water to form a cavity through which the object travels. When a vapor cavity completely encapsulates an underwater object the process is referred to as supercavitation. Supercavitation allows for the higher speeds to be sustainable by reducing skin friction drag to a great extent at such higher speeds. The conditions for supercavitation are known in the art.

To obtain supercavitation fluid may be accelerated over a sharp edge of the vehicle so that the pressure in the fluid drops below its vapor pressure after passing the edge. The component resulting in the pressure drop may be referred to herein as a cavitator. The cavitator generally part of the nose shape of the object is the only part of the object in constant contact with the water through which the vehicle travels.

However if the speed of the vehicle is not sufficiently fast the vapor cavity may collapse about the trailing portions of the vehicle. In such cases artificial ventilation may be introduced into the cavity which maintains the cavity beyond the trailing edge of the object.

In a ventilated cavity i.e. one maintained by vaporous or artificial cavitation the stability of the cavity interface can be maintained by insuring that the gas within the cavity is moving at same the speed as the vehicle. This reduces instabilities at the air water interface. As a result the vehicle within the cavity is surrounded by high speed ventilation gas.

For stability and control current supercavitating vehicles rely on one or more tail fins extending radially from an aft portion of the vehicle. Stability is maintained by tail planing whereby the tail fin is extended into the air water interface of the cavity. Control surfaces on the tail fins control the vehicle trajectory.

However the existing system of aft vehicle control produces considerable parasitic drag. In addition such systems create continuous low frequency oscillations that result in intermittent banging of the tail surface on the air water interface. The banging results in structural vibration which increases the noise emanating from the vehicle and thereby decreases the overall stealth of the vehicle.

What is needed is a system for efficiently controlling a supercavitating vehicle. The system should provide an active damping mechanism such that a vehicle riding in an underwater supercavity needs not tail plane. The system should reduce both the streamwise drag of the vehicle and the structural vibration induced by tail planing thus enhancing the stability of the vehicle increasing its range and improving its stealth. In addition to stabilizing the vehicle in steady flight the system should provide for quickly turning the vehicle as well.

It is therefore a general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide systems and methods for controlling a supercavitating vehicle.

The object of the present invention is attained by providing a control system for a supercavitating vehicle comprising a set of wetted wings and a segmented ring wing extending from an aft portion of the vehicle. The wetted wings which may be referred to herein as winglets are supported by a strut attached to the vehicle. The angle of attack of each winglet is controlled by a winglet actuator. The winglet assembly may be extended into or retracted from the water by means of a spring loaded actuated mount which pivots the strut supporting the winglet. When fully retracted the winglet assembly is contained completely within the cavity.

The segmented ring wing is controlled by one or more ring actuators. The dynamic effects of the ring wing may be neutralized by using the cavitator of the vehicle to globally enlarge the cavity and thus limit the flow over the ring wing. Alternately or in combination the ring actuator may be used to control the angle of attack of the ring wing. Thus fine stabilization control is conducted by the wing ring and rapid maneuverability is obtained by the winglets.

In one embodiment a system for controlling a trajectory of a supercavitating underwater vehicle which forms a cavity about itself in underwater travel comprises a winglet connected to the vehicle. The winglet may be extendable into a flow of water surrounding the cavity and an angle of attack of the winglet may be adjustable to affect maneuverability of the vehicle. The system also comprises a segmented ring wing having at least two segments each segment being separately extendable into the cavity. An angle of attack of each segment may be adjustable to affect stability of the vehicle within the cavity.

In one variation a winglet strut may have a first end pivotally connected to the vehicle and the winglet may be pivotally connected to a distal end of the winglet strut. A winglet actuator may be connected to the winglet and the winglet strut. Operation of the winglet actuator may pivot the winglet about the distal end of the winglet strut to adjust the angle of attack of the winglet.

A strut actuator may be connected to the winglet strut and the vehicle. Operation of the strut actuator may pivot the winglet strut about the first end of the winglet strut to extend the winglet into the flow of water. The strut actuator may be biased to pivot the winglet strut about its first end to retract the winglet from the flow of water.

In another variation ring struts each may have a first end connected to the vehicle and a distal end pivotally connected to one of the segments of the ring wing. Ring actuators each may be connected to one of the ring struts and a corresponding one of the segments. Operation of a ring actuator may pivot the corresponding segment about the distal end of the ring strut to adjust the angle of attack of the corresponding segment in the cavity. Each ring actuator is biased to adjust the angle of attack of the corresponding segment to provide steady lift.

Each of the ring actuators is operable to retract the corresponding segment from the cavity toward the vehicle such that the segment is within the body diameter of the vehicle. Recesses on the vehicle may be shaped to accommodate the segments within the body diameter.

In another variation a winglet strut may have a first end pivotally connected to the vehicle and the winglet may be pivotally connected to a distal end of the winglet strut. Ring struts each may have a first end connected to the vehicle and a distal end pivotally connected to one of the segments of the ring wing.

A winglet actuator may be connected to the winglet and the winglet strut such that operation of the winglet actuator may pivot the winglet about the distal end of the winglet strut to adjust the angle of attack of the winglet. Ring actuators each may be connected to one of the ring struts and a corresponding one of the segments such that operation of a ring actuator may pivot the corresponding segment about the distal end of the ring strut to adjust the angle of attack of the corresponding segment in the cavity.

A strut actuator may be connected to the winglet strut and the vehicle such that operation of the strut actuator may pivot the winglet strut about its first end so as to extend the winglet in the flow of water. The strut actuator may be biased to pivot the winglet strut about its first end so as to retract the winglet from the flow of water.

Each of the ring actuators may be biased to adjust the angle of attack of the corresponding segment to provide steady lift and each of the ring actuators may be operable to retract the corresponding segment from the cavity toward the vehicle such that the segment is within the body diameter of the vehicle. Recesses on the vehicle may be shaped to accommodate the segments within the body diameter of the vehicle.

Referring now to there is shown a side view of underwater vehicle traversing through a fluid medium . For ease of reference medium is described herein as water. As is known in the art water is accelerated over a cavitator attached to a nose portion of vehicle . The downstream pressure drops below the vapor pressure of water after passing cavitator resulting in the formation of cavity through which vehicle traverses.

For stability and control of vehicle winglets and segmented ring wing extend from an aft portion of vehicle . In the side view of two winglets and two segments of ring wing are illustrated. However those of skill in the art will recognize that the number of winglets and segments can be varied with the winglets and segments being spaced equally about vehicle for maintaining balance. Thus for balance purposes but not for limitation at least two winglets and at least two segments may be provided. Preferably four sets of winglets and segments maintain balance while providing an adequate level of control for vehicle as explained further herein. For ease of fabrication each set of one winglet and one segment preferably is aligned longitudinally with winglet being further aft than segment though other arrangements of components are contemplated.

Each winglet is supported by winglet strut which is pivotally attached to vehicle . Both winglet and winglet strut may be hydrodynamically shaped to minimize drag. However those of skill in the art will recognize that the detailed shape i.e. chord span or thickness of winglet or winglet strut will depend on the particular design conditions for vehicle .

When extended away from vehicle by means of pivoting winglet strut as shown in winglet strut extends through cavity and winglet extends into water . The angle of attack of each winglet with respect to the flow of water is controlled by winglet actuator . Strut actuator pivots winglet strut about its attachment point to vehicle as indicated by arrow A. Having winglets extend into water provides rapid maneuverability as the angle of attack of winglets is controlled by actuators .

Referring also to there is shown a partial cross sectional view of a segment taken at line of . Each segment of ring wing is supported by ring strut . As is the case for winglets and winglet struts both segments and ring struts may be hydrodynamically shaped to minimize drag and those of skill in the art will recognize that their detailed shape i.e. chord span or thickness will depend on the particular design conditions for vehicle .

Ring struts may be pivotally connected to segments such that the angle of attack of segments into the flow through cavity may be controlled by one or more ring actuators . Ring actuators may bias the angle of attack such that segments provide a steady lift to carry the weight of vehicle within cavity . Additionally or in combination the dynamic effects of ring wing on the shape of cavity may be diminished by using cavitator to enlarge cavity and thus limit the flow effects over ring wing . Since segments only extend into cavity they have less influence on maneuverability than that afforded by winglets . However segments do provide the necessary fine stabilization control to reduce the tail banging associated with current supercavitating vehicles.

Generally vehicle will be launched underwater from a tube. To facilitate such a launch both winglets and ring wing together with their respective struts and may be retractable so that vehicle may fit within the launching tube.

For winglets strut actuator may be biased to retract winglet and winglet strut . For illustration in and not limitation winglet actuator is biased by spring . When retracted as indicated in phantom in winglet and winglet strut are contained within cavity . Additionally winglets may retracted during periods of steady flight of vehicle i.e. during periods when rapid maneuvering is not required.

For segments ring actuator s may be used to retract segments and ring struts . Alternately or in combination retraction actuator may be provided to retract segments and ring struts . Segments when fully retracted may be recessed into the body diameter of vehicle to permit the tube launch of vehicle . Those of skill in the art will recognize that the amount of recess is a function of the mean thickness of cavity at the axial location of ring wing . Extending the thickness of cavity in the location of ring wing will increase the volumetric flow area within cavity . As a result the effectiveness of ring wing in providing stabilization control will decrease. Thus ring wing may be operated in conjunction with cavitator to produce a desirable cross section for cavity depending on the particular maneuver desired for vehicle .

Referring to there is illustrated a cross sectional view of aft portion of vehicle taken at line of . In actuators and are not shown for clarity. For illustration but not for limitation shows ring wing having four segments two of which are shown extended labeled e and two of which are shown retracted labeled r . Also for illustration but not for limitation vehicle includes recesses into which segments may rest when fully retracted such that vehicle may be tube launched as discussed previously herein.

As shown in segments are arcuate segments of ring wing having a centerpoint c coincident with that of vehicle when extended. The radius r of segments will depend on the extent to which segments extend into cavity . The included angle will depend on the number of segments and the extent to which segments will be separated when fully retracted. As illustrated in is such that segments do not overlap when retracted.

What has thus been described is a control system for a supercavitating underwater vehicle that provides enhanced stabilization control and more rapid maneuverability. A set of winglets extends through the cavity and into the water to provide for rapid maneuverability. A segmented ring wing operates within the cavity and provides for fine stabilization control. The angle of attack of the winglets and ring wing may be controlled by actuators. Each winglet is supported by a strut that is pivotally attached to the vehicle. The winglet assembly may be extended into the water or retracted to be completely within the cavity by means of a spring loaded actuated mount which pivots the strut about its attachment to the vehicle. The winglets and segmented ring wing may be retracted such that the vehicle may be tube launched.

Thus the system not only provides maneuverability through the winglets but the segmented ring wing controls the stability of the vehicle such that low frequency vehicle oscillations of the vehicle are minimized. By so doing contact with the cavity boundary is avoided and structural vibrations are minimized. Separate controls for maneuverability and stability provide increased flexibility in controlling the flight path of the vehicle.

Obviously many modifications and variations of the present invention may become apparent in light of the above teachings. For example the system may be mounted at various axial positions along the vehicle the number of ring wing segments and winglets may be varied to suit the geometry of a particular vehicle and the detailed shape of the winglets ring wing or support struts may be varied to suit. Further the relative positions of the winglets and ring wing as well as the configuration of their support struts may be varied. Additionally the fine stability control provided by the ring wing and the maneuverability provided by the winglets may be used independently.

It will be understood that many additional changes in details materials steps and arrangements of parts which have been described herein and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.
