The present application relates generally to the technical field of algorithms and programming and in one specific example the manipulation of images.

Images may be easily manipulated using anyone of a number of image editing software applications. These image editing applications may allow for a user to resize an image change the color in an image or perform any one of a number of operations on an image. These image editing applications may be stand alone applications that do not require network connectivity to operate.

In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of an example embodiment of the present invention. It may be evident however to one skilled in the art that the present invention will be practiced without these specific details.

In some example embodiments a system and method is illustrated for augmenting an image with an additional image or portion thereof collectively an image to create an augmented image. This augmentation may be facilitated through the searching and retrieval of an image that includes characteristics e.g. data similar to the characteristics in the image that is being augmented. A characteristic may include color histograms an image pattern a bit value and associated codec or macro block matching. A color code may be included in the characteristic s where a color code is a hexadecimal representation of a color. For example a first image of a bridge e.g. a characteristic or collection of characteristics may be augmented with a second image of the same bridge where the second image shows aspects of the bridge that a user would like to include in the first image. The image may be a photo that is a two dimensional artifact. The first image and second image may be formatted using a Joint Photographic Experts Group Format JPEG a Graphics Interchange Format GIF a Tagged Image File Format TIFF or some other suitable file format. These file formats may be referenced below as codecs.

In some example embodiments the system and method is shown for augmenting an image with an additional image using pixel values to denote a portion of the image to augment. In one example embodiment selection input may be received denoting a portion of an image that is to be augmented with an additional image. Augment may mean to increase to replace to add or to create. A search may be conducted using the selection input such that the potion of the image may be searched for in a native database or within a network environment. Search may be based upon characteristics of an image or some other suitable basis.

In some example embodiments the system and method is shown for augmenting an image with an additional image using computers organized in a client server arrangement. A client computer may have a web browser or other suitable Hyper Text Markup Language HTML or eXtensible Markup Language XML interpreter and client engine operatively coupled to the web browser. The client engine may be a FLASH Asynchronous JavaScript and XML AJAX ACTIVE X a SILVERLIGHT MOONLIGHT or Java client engine. This client engine is referenced herein as a plug in. One or more devices may act as a client computer. A server computer may be an application server web server or some combination of an application server and a web server. An image editing server or social networking server may be a server computer. An image editing server may be a server that allows for a client computer to augment an image with an additional image. A social networking server may be a server that executes software to build online social networks for communities of people e.g. natural persons or legal entities such as corporations who share interests and activities or who are interested in exploring the interests and activities of others.

In some example embodiments the system and method is shown for augmenting an image with an additional image that may include the image editing server retrieving an image to augment another image. The augmentation itself may be executed by the plug in. In one example embodiment the client computer receives the additional image as an image search result that may be manipulated by a user. Further the client computer receives input to manipulate the image received as part of the search result into a position in a GUI. A result of this manipulation the image is augmented with the additional image to create an augmented image.

In some example embodiments the system and method is shown for posting the augmented image e.g. as a modified image with a search result on a social networking web page for a particular user. A social network server may provide the functionality to request and augment an image with an additional image. This functionality may be accessed by the client computer such that the social networking server may act as an intermediary see below figures between the client computer and the image editing server.

In some example embodiments augmenting may include the alignment of two more images based upon the continuity of bit values. For example an image may be augmented with an additional image where the characteristics represented in each image is similar. Similarity may be based upon using a probability algorithm to determine if the characteristic is present in both images. This similarity may be based upon bits values or metadata and the similarity between the bit values in the image and the additional image.

Some example embodiments may include the above illustrated operations being written as one or more software components. These components and the functionality associated with each may be used by client server or peer computer systems. These various components can be implemented into the system on an as needed basis. These components may be written in an object oriented computer language such that a component oriented or object oriented programming technique can be implemented using a Visual Component Library VCL Component Library for Cross Platform CLX Java Beans JB Enterprise Java Beans EJB Component Object Model COM or Distributed Component Object Model DCOM or other suitable technique. These components are linked to other components via various Application Programming Interfaces APIs and then compiled into one complete server and or client application. The method for using components in the building of client and server applications is well known in the art. Further these components may be linked together via various distributed programming protocols as distributed computing components.

Some example embodiments may include remote procedure calls being used to implement one or more of the above illustrated components across a distributed programming environment. For example a logic level may reside on a first computer system that is located remotely from a second computer system including an interface level e.g. a GUI . These first and second computer systems can be configured in a server client peer to peer or some other configuration. The various levels can be written using the above illustrated component design principles and can be written in the same programming language or in different programming languages. Various protocols may be implemented to enable these various levels and the components included therein to communicate regardless of the programming language used to write these components. For example an operation written in C using Common Object Request Broker Architecture CORBA or Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP can communicate with another remote module written in Java . Suitable protocols include SOAP CORBA and other protocols well known in the art.

Some embodiments may utilize the OSI model or TCP IP protocol stack model for defining the protocols used by a network to transmit data. In applying these models a system of data transmission between a server and client or between peer computer systems is illustrated as a series of roughly five layers comprising an application layer a transport layer a network layer a data link layer and a physical layer. In the case of software having a three tier architecture the various tiers e.g. the interface logic and storage tiers reside on the application layer of the TCP IP protocol stack. In an example implementation using the TCP IP protocol stack model data from an application residing at the application layer is loaded into the data load field of a TCP segment residing at the transport layer. This TCP segment also includes port information for a recipient software application residing remotely. This TCP segment is loaded into the data load field of an IP datagram residing at the network layer. Next this IP datagram is loaded into a frame residing at the data link layer. This frame is then encoded at the physical layer and the data transmitted over a network such as an internet LAN WAN or some other suitable network. In some cases internet refers to a network of networks. These networks may use a variety of protocols for the exchange of data including the aforementioned TCP IP or some other suitable protocol. These networks may be organized within a variety of topologies e.g. a star topology or structures.

The example computer system includes a processor e.g. a CPU a Graphics Processing Unit GPU or both a main memory and a static memory which communicate with each other via a bus . The computer system may further include a video display unit e.g. a Liquid Crystal Display LCD or a Cathode Ray Tube CRT . The computer system also includes an alphanumeric input device e.g. a keyboard a UI cursor controller e.g. a mouse a drive unit a signal generation device e.g. a speaker and a network interface device e.g. a transmitter . The disk drive unit includes a machine readable medium on which is stored one or more sets of instructions and data structures e.g. software embodying or used by any one or more of the methodologies or functions illustrated herein. The software instructions may also reside completely or at least partially within the main memory and or within the processor during execution thereof by the computer system the main memory and the processor also constituting machine readable media. The instructions may further be transmitted or received over a network via the network interface device using any one of a number of well known transfer protocols e.g. HTTP or Secure Hyper Text Transfer Protocol HTTPS .

The term machine readable medium should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media e.g. a centralized or distributed database and or associated caches and servers that store the one or more sets of instructions. The term machine readable medium shall also be taken to include any medium that is capable of storing encoding or carrying a set of instructions for execution by the machine and that cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies illustrated herein. The term machine readable medium shall accordingly be taken to include but not be limited to solid state memories optical and magnetic media and carrier wave signals.

In some example embodiments a system and method is illustrated for augmenting an image with an additional image. This additional image may be retrieved from a database or searchable network and may be retrieved based upon a match between the additional image and the image. The matching may be based upon commonality of bit values and the color associated with the bit values. The augmenting of the image may be performed using some type of client engine associated with a browser application. An augmented image may be displayed as part of a web page served up by a social networking server.
