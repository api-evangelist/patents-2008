title: Anti-collision lighting systems and methods for a micro aerial vehicle
abstract: Systems and methods for anti-collision lights on a UAV. A method for passive anti-collision lights on a Micro-Aerial Vehicle (“MAV”) including determining a location of the MAV using a flight management computer configured to fly the MAV on a programmed path using data from a global positioning system and an inertial navigation system. The flight management system transmits light activation data and selectively activates at least one navigation light located on a visible surface of the MAV using the light activation data from the flight management computer.
