This application claims priority to U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60 881 158 filed Jan. 19 2007.

This invention was made with government support under Contract No. MDA972 01 C 0066 awarded by the DARPA. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

Hydrogen based fuel cells are attracting widespread interest due to their high efficiency and potential for environmental soundness. A limitation to commercial adoption of hydrogen based fuel cells however is the production and storage of hydrogen. Hydrogen based fuel cells currently require systems which can store hydrogen. This however is inefficient. Furthermore there currently is no hydrogen infrastructure in the United States or any other part of the world. Thus even if problems associated with hydrogen storage are solved hydrogen fuel itself is not readily available.

On board or on site hydrogen production from fuels such as gasoline jet fuel or diesel fuel offers an efficient and practical means to produce hydrogen for fuel cells. Current art limitations to on board or on site manufacture of hydrogen however include rapid catalytic deactivation due to carbon formation and or sulfur poisoning.

A need therefore exists for sulfur tolerant catalysts for hydrocarbon reforming which also are resistant to carbon formation.

The invention relates to novel bimetallic and trimetallic catalysts their manufacture and use in both steam reforming and oxidative steam reforming of liquid fuels such as jet fuels diesel fuels and gasoline to produce synthesis gas and or hydrogen for fuel cell applications. The invention further relates to manufacture of synthesis gas and or hydrogen gas for chemicals synthesis and fuel processing. The catalysts have high sulfur tolerance and carbon resistance when used in steam reforming and or oxidative steam reforming of heavy hydrocarbon fuels.

The novel catalysts may be used to convert liquid hydrocarbon fuels to hydrogen at low temperatures of about 500 C. to about 600 C. under steam reforming conditions as well as under oxidative steam reforming conditions. Lower fuel decomposition during mixing and preheating of the fuels lower energy usage during reforming as well as higher yield of hydrogen per unit of hydrocarbon fuels also may be achieved.

The bimetallic and trimetallic catalysts are sulfur tolerant and resist carbon formation during steam reforming and or oxidative steam reforming of various transportation fuels. The catalysts are highly active for low temperature reforming of liquid fuels which contain sulfur and carbon forming compounds.

The invention achieves noble metal based and non noble metal based bimetallic and or trimetallic catalysts on an alumina support or on a R metal oxide stabilized alumina support where R is any one of Ce Zr Ga La Y or mixtures thereof. The first metal component of the bimetallic and trimetallic nobel metal based catalysts is a precious metal such as Rh Ru or Pt preferably Rh. The second component in noble metal based bimetallic catalysts is a transition metal such as Ni Co Fe Mo Cu Zn preferably Ni Co Fe Zn most preferably Ni which protects the noble metal from sulfur poisoning. The second and third metals in the noble metal based trimetallic catalysts may be a combination of two transition metals such as Ni Co Ni Fe Ni Zn Ni Mo Ni Cu preferably Ni Co Ni Fe Ni Zn more preferably Ni Co which also protect the nobel metal from sulfur poisoning and from carbon deposition to achieve high catalytic activity high sulfur tolerance and high carbon resistance. Useful noble metal based trimetallic catalysts include but are not limited to Rh Ni Co catalyst. In non noble metal based catalysts the first metal component of the bimetallic and trimetallic catalysts preferably is Ni metal. The second and the third components may be a transition metal such as Co Fe Mo Cu Zn preferably Co Fe Zn or mixtures thereof most preferably Co which when employed in combination are capable of minimizing sulfur poisoning and carbon formation during reforming.

The noble metal based bimetallic catalysts have the formula M1 x M2 y where 0.5 x 5 and 2 y 20 where all amount are based on the total weight of the catalyst including support and where M1 is Rh Ru or Pt and M2 is Ni Co Fe Mo Cu or Zn. The bimetallic catalysts may include an alkaline earth modifier metal such as Ca K or mixtures thereof. The noble based trimetallic catalysts have the formula M1 x M2 y M3 z where 0.5 x 5 2 y 20 and 2 z 20 where all amounts are based on the total weight of the catalyst including support and where M1 is Rh Ru or Pt and M2 and M3 are different and each of M2 and M3 may be Ni Co Fe Mo Cu or Zn. The non noble metal based catalysts have the formula N1 x N2 y where 5 x 40 and 5 y 20 where all amounts are based on the total weight of the catalyst including support and where N1 is Ni and N2 is Co Fe Mo Cu Zn or mixtures thereof.

The support materials employed in the catalysts are selected to promote low temperature steam reforming of liquid hydrocarbons. The support material preferably is gamma alumina AlO which may be doped with a dopant rare earth oxide such as any of CeO YO ZrO LaO GaOor combinations thereof. The doped gamma alumina support may be further modified by addition of one or more other oxides such as YO CeO ZrO KO NaO MgO CaO or SrO or mixtures thereof.

The invention also provides a method of steam reforming of hydrocarbon fuels containing sulfur. The method generally entails heating any of bimetallic catalysts of the formula M1 x M2 y where 0.5 x 5 and 2 y 20 where all amounts are based on the total weight of the catalyst including support and where M1 is selected from the group consisting of Rh Ru Pt or mixtures thereof and M2 is selected from the group consisting of Ni Co Fe Mo Cu Zn or mixtures thereof or trimetallic catalyst of the formula M1 x M2 y M3 z where 0.5 x 5 2 y 20 and 2 z 20 where all amounts are based on the total weight of the catalyst including support and where M1 is selected from the group consisting of Rh Ru Pt or mixtures thereof M2 and M3 are different and each is selected from the group consisting of Ni Co Fe Mo Cu Zn or mixtures on a R stabilized alumina support where R is selected from the group consisting of Ce Zr Ga La Y or mixtures thereof in a reducing atmosphere to yield an activated catalyst and then passing a liquid hydrocarbon fuel which may contain sulfur over the activated catalyst at an elevated temperature to produce hydrogen and or synthesis gas for applications.

The catalysts such as Rh Ni Rh Ni Co on support materials may be employed in reforming applications as well as in automotive portable power stationary power home power generation military applications as well as other sectors where hydrogen generation is desired.

Generally the noble metal based bimetallic catalysts of the formula M1 x M2 y where 0.5 x 5 and 2 y 20 the noble metal based trimetallic catalysts of the formula M1 x M2 y M3 z where 0.5 x 5 2 y 20 and 2 z 20 and the non noble metal based catalysts of the formula N1 x N2 y where 5 x 40 and 5 y 20 where all amounts are based on the total weight of the catalyst including support are made by wet impregnation of metal precursors onto a support material such as gamma alumina CeO doped gamma alumina or ZrO doped gamma alumina La doped gamma alumina Y doped gamma alumina preferably CeO doped gamma alumina. The support material is made by impregnating an alumina preferably gamma alumina with a rare earth precursor salt such as cerium nitrate lanthanum nitrate gadolinium nitrate and zirconyl nitrate or mixtures thereof. In manufacture of the support material gamma alumina is dried and then a desired amount of the dried gamma alumina is mixed with deionized water while stirring at about 60 C. to about 70 C. to produce an aqueous slurry of gamma alumina. An aqueous solution of a dopant precursor salt such as cerium nitrate or a mixture of dopant precursor salts such as cerium nitrate and yttrium nitrate then is added to the gamma alumina slurry while stirring at about 60 C. about 70 C. until excess water is evaporated to produce a doped support powder. The amount of dopant oxide precursor added typically is sufficient to achieve an amount of dopant oxide of about 1 to about 70 by weight preferably about 2 to about 50 by weight more preferably about 10 to about 30 by the total weight of the final doped support material. The doped support material is vacuum dried at about 100 C. to about 120 C. for about 2 hrs to about 12 hrs preferably about 4 hours to about 6 hours to produce a dried doped support material powder. The dried powder then is calcined in air. Calcination is performed in a furnace such as a muffle furnace under flowing air while heating at about 1 C. min to about 3 C. min to a temperature of about 500 C. to about 600 C. and holding at about 500 C. to about 600 C. for about 4 hours to about 8 hours preferably about 6 hrs. The furnace then is turned off and naturally cooled to room temperature to produce a calcined doped support material.

In manufacture of the catalyst the calcined doped support material is mixed with deionized water while stirring at about 60 C. to about 70 C. to achieve a slurry of the doped support material. An aqueous solution of one or more of catalyst metal precursors such as Rh nitrate Pt nitrate Ru nitrate Co nitrate Fe nitrate Mo nitrate Cu nitrate Zn nitrate Ni nitrate or mixtures thereof where the amount of metal nitrates in the solution is based on the desired weight percent of the metal in the catalyst is added to the slurry of doped support material. The resulting slurry is stirred at about 60 C. to about 70 C. to evaporate water to produce a catalyst powder. The resulting catalyst powder then is dried under vacuum at about 100 C. to about 120 C. for about 4 hrs to about 12 hrs. After drying the catalyst powder is calcined in a muffle furnace under flowing air and heated at about 1 C. min to about 3 C. min to a temperature of about 500 C. to about 600 C. and held at about 500 C. to about 600 C. for about 4 hrs to about 8 hrs preferably about 6 hrs to produce a calcined catalyst powder. The calcined catalyst powder is then pelletized to produce a disk. The disk is crushed and sieved to a suitable size such as about 18 35 mesh. The sieved catalyst material is heated in a reducing gas such as flowing hydrogen hydrogen in argon or hydrogen in nitrogen gas preferably flowing hydrogen at about 2 C. min to about 5 C. min to a temperature of about 500 C. to about 600 C. and held at about 500 C. to about 600 C. for about 5 hours to about 8 hours. The flow of hydrogen gas then is terminated to yield a metallic catalyst.

The invention is illustrated in more detail below by reference to the following non limiting examples.

Aqueous slurry of gamma alumina is formed by adding 20 ml deionized water to 15 gm of UOP VGL 15 gamma alumina supplied by UOP Company. 10 ml of aqueous Ce nitrate solution formed by mixing 10 ml water and 9.46 gm Ce nitrate Cerium III nitrate hexahydrate 99.99 Aldrich is added at the rate of 1 drop per sec with a pipette to 35 gm of aqueous slurry of UOP VGL 15 gamma alumina to form a treated slurry. The treated slurry is stirred at 65 C. to evaporate excess water and the resulting powder is dried under vacuum at 120 C. for 12 hours. The resulting dried support material is placed in a ceramic crucible and calcined in a muffle furnace under an air flow of 70 cc min to produce CeOAlOsupport material. During calcination the support material is heated at 1 C. min to 600 C. and held at 600 C. for 6 hrs. The furnace then is turned off and allowed to cool naturally to room temperature. Then 4.8 gm of the calcined CeOAlOsupport material is mixed with 10 ml deionized water while continuously stirring at 70 C.

The resulting treated CeOAlOslurry is then continuously stirred at 65 C. until all water in liquid form is evaporated to produce a Rh Ni catalyst precursor powder. The catalyst precursor powder is then dried under vacuum at 120 C. for 12 hrs. The dried catalyst precursor powder then is placed in a ceramic crucible and calcined in a muffle furnace with flowing air at 70 cc min while heating at 1 C. min to 600 C. and holding at 600 C. for 6 hrs. The furnace then is shut off and allowed to cool to room temperature. The calcined catalyst powder is compressed in a pellet presser at 6000 PSI to produce a disk. The disk then is crushed and sieved to 18 35 mesh. The sieved catalyst is placed between two quartz wool layers inside a reactor tube under flowing hydrogen at a flow rate of 20 cc min. While in the flowing hydrogen the sieved catalyst is heated at 2 C. min to 500 C. and held at 500 C. for 5 hours.

In steam reforming the bimetallic and trimetallic catalysts are first treated in a reducing atmosphere such as hydrogen to produce an activated catalyst. A hydrocarbon fuel which may contain sulfur then is passed over the activated catalyst at an elevated temperature to produce hydrogen and or synthesis gas. NORPAR 13 from Exxon Mobile Corp. loaded with a desired amount of S is employed as a model fuel for evaluating the sulfur tolerance and carbon resistance of the catalysts. NORPAR 13 is an industrial solvent that contains normal paraffins with an average carbon chain length of 13 and sulfur. The various NORPAR 13 fuels with differing sulfur concentration used in the examples below are prepared by doping 3 methylbenzothiophene into the initial NORPAR 13 to achieve a desired concentration of S. The amount of sulfur in parts per million by weight ppmw is indicated by the number that precedes S in S NORPAR 13 . To illustrate 100 S NOPAR 13 is made by adding 0.216 g 3 methylbenzothiophene into about 500 g NORPAR 13 with stirring to achieve 100 ppmw sulfur in NORPAR 13 fuel.

One gram of the catalyst of example 1 that has a mesh size of 18 35 is loaded into a stainless steel tube reactor 0.54 O.D. 0.375 I.D. and 24 in length . The catalyst is placed at the center of the tube between two beds of quartz wool. The remainder of the reactor is filled with alpha alumina beads to reduce the dead volume. Then the reactor is heated in a furnace at 2 C. min to 500 C. under a 20 cc min flow of hydrogen gas and held at 500 C. for 5 hours to perform reduction of the catalyst. The hydrogen flow then is terminated and the gas flow is changed to a mixture of nitrogen 35 cc min and steam at a liquid water flow rate of 4.08 cc hr. After 30 minutes 100 S NORPAR 13 model fuel is introduced into the gaseous mixture of nitrogen and steam about 20 N 80 steam at a flow rate of 1.38 cc hr to achieve a steam to carbon molar ratio S C of 3.0. After 30 minutes of fuel flow the nitrogen flow is reduced to 1 cc min. The total weight hourly space velocity WHSV defined as g reactants hr g cat is 5.13 hr. As soon as the deactivation of the catalyst is observed as indicated by a rapid drop of fuel conversion the nitrogen flow is increased to 120 cc min and the flow of 100 S NORPAR 13 model fuel and steam are terminated. The resulting spent catalyst is allowed to cool to room temperature by turning off power to the furnace opening the door of the furnace and passing Nthrough the furnace at 120 cc min. All gas compositions are analyzed by an on line SRI multigas analyzer equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. The conversion of the fuel to reformate is calculated according to the equation Conv 1 fuel fuel fuel 100 .

To determine the weight percent of carbon wt on the spent catalyst temperature programmed oxidation TPO of carbon is performed on a LECO RC 412 Multiphase Carbon Analyzer. TPO is performed by heating the spent catalyst at 30 C. min to 900 C. under ultra pure oxygen to oxidize any carbon present on the spent catalyst to carbon dioxide. The amount of carbon dioxide generated is monitored by an IR cell and the amount of carbon is determined on the basis of the amount of carbon dioxide generated from the sample.
