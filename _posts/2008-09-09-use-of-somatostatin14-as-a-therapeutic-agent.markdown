The identification of a therapeutic compound effective for the prophylaxis and or treatment of a disease can be based on the activity of the compound in a biological assay. A biological assay that mimics a disease causative mechanism can be used to test the therapeutic activity of a candidate peptide.

The causative mechanism of many diseases is the over activity of a biological pathway. A peptide that can reduce the activity of the biological pathway can be effective in the prophylaxis and or treatment of the disease caused by the over activity of the biological pathway. Similarly the causative mechanism of many diseases is the over production of a biological molecule. A peptide that can reduce the production of the biological molecule or block the activity of the over produced biological molecule can be effective in the prophylaxis and or treatment of the disease caused by the over production of the biological molecule.

Conversely the causative mechanism of many diseases is the under activity of a biological pathway. A peptide that can increase the activity of the biological pathway can be effective in the prophylaxis and or treatment of the disease caused by the under activity of the biological pathway. Also similarly the causative mechanism of many diseases is the under production of a biological molecule. A peptide that can increase the production of the biological molecule or mimic the biological activity of the under produced biological molecule can be effective in the prophylaxis and or treatment of the disease caused by the under production of the biological molecule.

The immune system in higher vertebrates represents the first line of defense against various antigens that can enter the vertebrate body including microorganisms such as bacteria fungi and viruses that are the causative agents of a variety of diseases.

Despite large immunization programs viral infections such as influenza virus human immunodeficiency virus HIV herpes simplex virus HSV type 1 or 2 human papilloma virus HPV type 16 or 18 human cytomegalovirus HCMV or human hepatitis B or C virus HBV Type B HCV type C infections remain a serious source of morbidity and mortality throughout the world and a significant cause of illness and death among people with immune deficiency associated with aging or different clinical conditions. Although antiviral chemotherapy with compounds such as amantadine and rimantadine have been shown to reduce the duration of symptoms of clinical infections i.e. influenza infection major side effects and the emergence of drug resistant variants have been described. New classes of antiviral agents designed to target particular viral proteins such as influenza neuraminidase are being developed. However the ability of viruses to mutate the target proteins represents an obstacle for effective treatment with molecules which selectively inhibit the function of specific viral polypeptides. Thus there is need for new therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat viral infections.

Additionally there is a need for new therapies for the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections especially bacterial infections caused by multiple drug resistant bacteria. Currently bacterial infections are treated with various antibiotics. Although antibiotics have and can be effective in the treatment of various bacterial infections there are a number of limitations to the effectiveness and safety of antibiotics. For example some individuals have an allergic reaction to certain antibiotics and other individuals suffer from serious side effects. Moreover continued use of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial infections contributes to formation of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria.

Another aspect of the present invention is directed to the use of the peptide or the peptide combination for prophylaxis and or treatment of infectious diseases including opportunistic infections.

Examples of infectious diseases are AIDS alveolar hydatid disease AHD echinococcosis amebiasis infection infection anisakiasis anthrax babesiosis infection Balantidium infection balantidiasis infection raccoon roundworm bilharzia schistosomiasis infection blastomycosis boreliosis botulism Brainerd diarrhea brucellosis bovine spongiform encephalopathy BSE candidiasis capillariasis infection chronic fatigue syndrome CFS Chagas disease American trypanosomiasis chickenpox Varicella Zoster virus infection cholera Creutzfeldt Jakob disease CJD clonorchiasis infection cutaneous larva migrans CLM hookworm infection coccidioidomycosis conjunctivitis Coxsackievirus A16 hand foot and mouth disease cryptococcosis infection cryptosporidiosis mosquito West Nile virus vector cyclosporiasis infection cysticercosis neurocysticercosis Cytomegalovirus infection Dengue Dengue fever infection dog and cat flea tapeworm Ebola virus hemorrhagic fever encephalitis infection infection infection infection amebiasis infection enterobiasis pinworm infection enterovirus infection non polio Epstein Barr virus infection infection foodborne infection foot and mouth disease fungal dermatitis gastroenteritis group A streptococcal disease group B streptococcal disease Hansen s disease leprosy Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome head lice infestation pediculosis infection hematologic disease Hendra virus infection hepatitis HCV HBV herpes zoster shingles HIV Infection human ehrlichiosis human parainfluenza virus infection influenza isosporiasis infection Lassa fever leishmaniasis Kala azar Kala azar Infection lice body lice head lice pubic lice Lyme disease malaria Marburg hemorrhagic fever measles meningitis mosquito borne diseases complex MAC infection infection nosocomial infections nonpathogenic intestinal ameobae infection onchocerciasis river blindness opisthorciasis infection parvovirus infection plague pneumonia PCP polio Q fever rabies respiratory syncytial virus RSV Infection rheumatic fever Rift Valley fever river blindness onchocerciasis rotavirus infection roundworm infection salmonellosis scabies shigellosis shingles sleeping sickness smallpox streptococcal Infection tapeworm infection infection tetanus toxic shock syndrome tuberculosis ulcers peptic ulcer disease valley fever infection infection viral hemorrhagic fever warts waterborne infectious diseases West Nile virus infection West Nile encephalitis whooping cough yellow fever.

Another aspect of the present invention is directed to the use of the peptide or the peptide combination for prophylaxis and or treatment of prion diseases.

Prions are infectious agents which do not have a nucleic acid genome. It seems that a protein alone is the infectious agent. A prion has been defined as small proteinaceous infectious particle which resists inactivation by procedures that modify nucleic acids . The discovery that proteins alone can transmit an infectious disease came as a considerable surprise to the scientific community. Prion diseases are often called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies because of the post mortem appearance of the brain with large vacuoles in the cortex and cerebellum. Probably most mammalian species develop these diseases. Prion diseases are a group of neurodegenerative disorders of humans and animals and the prion diseases can manifest as sporadic genetic or infectious disorders. Examples of prion diseases acquired by exogenous infection are bovine spongiform encephalitis BSE of cattle and the new variant of Creutzfeld Jakob disease vCJD caused by BSE as well as scrapie of animals. Examples of human prion diseases include kuru sporadic Creutzfeldt Jakob disease sCJD familial CJD fCJD iatrogenic CJD iCJD Gerstmann Straussler Scheinker GSS disease fatal familial insomnia FFI and especially the new variant CJD m CJD or vCJD .

The name prion is used to describe the causative agents which underlie the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. A prion is proposed to be a novel infectious particle that differs from viruses and viroids. It is composed solely of one unique protein that resists most inactivation procedures such as heat radiation and proteases. The latter characteristic has led to the term protease resistant isoform of the prion protein. The protease resistant isoform has been proposed to slowly catalyze the conversion of the normal prion protein into the abnormal form.

The term isoform in the context of prions means two proteins with exactly the same amino acid sequence that can fold into molecules with dramatically different tertiary structures. The normal cellular isoform of the prion protein PrP has a high helix content a low sheet content and is sensitive to protease digestion. The abnormal disease causing isoform PrP has a lower helix content a much higher sheet content and is much more resistant to protease digestion.

As used herein the term prion diseases refers to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Examples for prion diseases comprise scrapie sheep goat transmissible mink encephalopathy TME mink chronic wasting disease CWD muledeer deer elk bovine spongiform encephalopathy BSE cows cattles Creutzfeld Jacob Disease CJD variant CJD vCJD sporadic Creutzfeldt Jakob disease sCJD familial CJD fCJD iatrogenic CJD iCJD Gerstmann Str ussler Scheinker syndrome GSS fatal familial insomnia FFI and kuru. Preferred are BSE vCJD and CJD.

The peptide or the peptide combination of the present invention were tested using the assays described in Examples 1 7 for their effect as active therapeutic agents in the prophylaxis and or treatment of infectious diseases and disorders.

Autoimmune disease refers to any of a group of diseases or disorders in which tissue injury is associated with a humoral and or cell mediated immune response to body constituents or in a broader sense an immune response to self. The pathological immune response may be systemic or organ specific. That is for example the immune response directed to self may affect joints skin myelin sheath that protects neurons kidney liver pancreas thyroid adrenals and ovaries.

In fact the list of autoimmune diseases is composed of more than eighty disorders. A few autoimmune diseases such as vitiligo in which patches of skin lose pigmentation are merely annoying. Most others are debilitating often progressive with time and eventually fatal. Systemic lupus erythematosus SLE for example is a chronic disease in which 10 15 of patients die within a decade of diagnosis in all but a few autoimmune diseases the sex ratio skews towards women. For example in SLE the ratio of female to male patients is nine to one. In one particular case Hashimoto s disease in which the immune system attacks the thyroid gland the ratio is fifty to one.

It has long been known that immune complex formation plays a role in the etiology and progression of autoimmune disease. For example inflammation in patients with arthritis has long been considered to involve phagocytosis by leukocytes of complexes of antigen antibody and complement immune complexes. However only now it is being recognized that inflammation caused by immune complexes in the joints arthritis the kidneys glomerulonephritis and blood vessels vasculitis is a major cause of morbidity in autoimmune diseases. Increased immune complex formation correlates with the presence of antibodies directed to self or so called autoantibodies and the presence of the latter can also contribute to tissue inflammation either as part of an immune complex or unbound to antigen free antibody . In some autoimmune diseases the presence of free autoantibody contributes significantly to disease pathology. This has been clearly demonstrated for example in SLE anti DNA antibodies immune thrombocytopenia antibody response directed to platelets and to a lesser extent rheumatoid arthritis IgG reactive rheumatoid factor . The important role of immune complexes and free autoantibodies is further demonstrated by the fact that successful treatment of certain autoimmune diseases has been achieved by the removal of immune complexes and free antibody by means of specific immunoadsorption procedures. For example the use of an apheresis procedure in which immune complexes and antibodies are removed by passage of a patient s blood through an immunoaffinity column was approved by the U.S. FDA in 1987 for immune thrombocytopenia ITP and in 1999 for rheumatoid arthritis. However currently there is no approved method for the treatment of autoimmune diseases which facilitates the elimination of immune complexes and autoantibodies by administration of a drug.

Another aspect of the etiology and progression of autoimmune disease is the role of proinflammatory cytokines. Under normal circumstances proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor TNF and interleukin 1 IL 1 play a protective role in the response to infection and cellular stress. However the pathological consequences which result from chronic and or excessive production of TNF and IL 1 are believed to underlie the progression of many autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis Crohn s disease inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis. Other proinflammatory cytokines include interleukin 6 interleukin 8 interleukin 17 and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor.

Naturally occurring CD4 CD25 regulatory T cells Tregs play a critical role in the control of periphery tolerance to self antigens. Interestingly they also control immune responses to allergens and transplant antigens. Recent studies in animal models have shown that adoptive transfer of CD4 CD25 Tregs can prevent or even cure allergic and autoimmune diseases and appear to induce transplantation tolerance. Thus adoptive cell therapy using patient specific CD4 CD25 Tregs has emerged as an individualized medicine for the treatment of inflammatory disease including allergy autoimmune disease and transplant rejection. Furthermore strategies to activate and expand antigen specific CD4 CD25 Tregs in vivo using pharmacological agents may represent a novel avenue for drug development.

The interaction of leukocytes with the vessel endothelium to facilitate the extravasation into the tissue represents a key process of the body s defense mechanisms. Excessive recruitment of leukocytes into the inflamed tissue in chronic diseases like autoimmune disorders could be prevented by interfering with the mechanisms of leukocyte extravasation. Significant progress in elucidating the molecular basis of the trafficking of leukocytes from the blood stream to the extravascular tissue has been achieved that enables new strategies for therapeutic approaches. The multistep process of leukocyte rolling firm adhesion and transmigration through the endothelial wall is facilitated by a dynamic interplay of adhesion receptors on both leukocytes and on endothelial cells as well as chemokines. In preclinical studies using various animal models promising results have been obtained demonstrating that blocking of adhesion receptors of the selectin and integrin families improved the inflammation process in models of ulcerative colitis autoimmune encephalomyelitis or contact hypersensitivity. In addition to the targeting of adhesion receptors by antibodies small molecules that mimic epitopes of adhesion receptor ligands have been developed and successfully applied in animal models. Clinical studies revealed a limited response using antibodies to selectins or leukocyte function associated antigen 1 LFA 1 integrins compared with animal models. However using humanized antibodies to the alpha 4 integrin subunit significant efficacy has been demonstrated in autoimmune diseases like psoriasis multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease.

Further diseases that may be caused by an autoimmune reaction are Behcet disease chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome CFIDS Cogan syndrome I endometriosis HELLP syndrome Bechterew s disease polymyalgia rheumatica psoriasis sarcoidosis and vitiligo.

During the last decade new biotherapies have been developed for the treatment of systemic autoimmune diseases. The targets of these new treatments are all the steps of the immune response. These new therapies are B lymphocyte BL inhibitors such as anti CD20 monoclonal antibody B lymphocyte stimulator BLyS antagonists and tolerogens of pathogenic antibody secreting LB inhibitors of the costimulation between antigen presenting cells and T lymphocyte TL like monoclonal anti CD40 ligand antibody or CTLA4 Ig abatecept TL antagonists which can inhibit the proliferation of autoreactive T cells cytokine antagonists chemokine and adhesin antagonists which inhibit trafficking of immunocompetent cells to target organs. These new approaches are based on a better understanding of the autoimmune response.

The peptide or the peptide combination of the present invention were tested using the assays described in Examples 14 15 for their effect as active therapeutic agents in the prophylaxis and or treatment of autoimmune diseases and disorders.

Fibrosis or fibrosis associated disorder affects the liver epidermis endodermis muscle tendon cartilage heart pancreas lung uterus nervous system testis ovary adrenal gland artery vein colon small intestine biliary tract or stomach. In a further embodiment the fibrosis or fibrosis associated disorder is interstitial lung fibrosis. In another embodiment the fibrosis or fibrosis associated disorder is the result of an infection with schistosoma. In another embodiment the fibrosis or fibrosis associated disorder is the result of wound healing.

Fibrosis is generally characterized by the pathologic or excessive accumulation of collagenous connective tissue. Fibrotic diseases and disorders include but are not limited to collagen disease interstitial lung disease human fibrotic lung disease e.g. obliterative bronchiolitis idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis pulmonary fibrosis from a known etiology tumor stroma in lung disease systemic sclerosis affecting the lungs Hermansky Pudlak syndrome coal worker s pneumoconiosis asbestosis silicosis chronic pulmonary hypertension AIDS associated pulmonary hypertension sarcoidosis and the like fibrotic vascular disease tubulointerstitial and glomerular fibrosis myocardial fibrosis arterial sclerosis atherosclerosis varicose veins coronary infarcts cerebral infarcts myocardial fibrosis musculoskeletal fibrosis post surgical adhesions human kidney disease e.g. nephritic syndrome Alport s syndrome HIV associated nephropathy polycystic kidney disease Fabry s disease diabetic nephropathy chronic glomerulonephritis nephritis associated with systemic lupus and the like cutis keloid formation progressive systemic sclerosis PSS primary sclerosing cholangitis PSC liver fibrosis liver cirrhosis renal fibrosis pulmonary fibrosis cystic fibrosis chronic graft versus host disease scleroderma local and systemic Grave s opthalmopathy diabetic retinopathy glaucoma Peyronie s disease penis fibrosis urethrostenosis after a test using a cystoscope inner accretion after surgery scarring myelofibrosis idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis peritoneal fibrosis from a known etiology drug induced ergotism fibrosis incident to benign or malignant cancer fibrosis incident to microbial infection e.g. viral bacterial parasitic fungal etc. Alzheimer s disease fibrosis incident to inflammatory bowel disease including stricture formation in Crohn s disease and microscopic colitis fibrosis induced by chemical or environmental insult e.g. cancer chemotherapy pesticides radiation cancer radiotherapy and the like.

Diseases associated with fibrosis include lupus graft versus host disease scleroderma systemic sclerosis scleroderma like disorders sine scleroderma calcinosis Raynaud s esophageal dysfunction sclerodactyl telangiectasiae hypersensitivity pneumonitis collagen vascular disease asthma pulmonary arterial hypertension glomerulonephritis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease fibrosis following myocardial infarction central nervous system fibrosis following a stroke or neuro degenerative diseases e.g. Alzheimer s disease proliferative vitreoretinopathy PVR and arthritis silicosis asbestos induced pulmonary fibrosis acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome including bacterial pneumonia induced trauma induced viral pneumonia induced tuberculosis ventilator induced non pulmonary sepsis induced and aspiration induced .

The emergence and disappearance of the myofibroblast appears to correlate with the initiation of active fibrosis and its resolution respectively. In addition the myofibroblast has many phenotypic features which embody much of the pathologic alterations in fibrotic tissue e.g. lung tissue. These features would seem to argue for an important role for the myofibroblast in the pathogenesis of fibrosis e.g. lung fibrosis. Furthermore the persistence of the myofibroblast may herald progressive disease and conversely its disappearance may be an indicator of resolution. This in turn suggests that future therapeutic strategies targeting the myofibroblast would be productive.

Patients usually exhibit evidence of active fibrosis with increased numbers of activated fibroblasts many of which have the phenotypic characteristics of myofibroblasts. At these sites increased amounts of extracellular matrix deposition are evident with effacement of the normal alveolar architecture. Animal model studies show the myofibroblast to be the primary source of type I collagen gene expression in active fibrotic sites. In vitro studies show differentiation of these cells from fibroblasts under the influence of certain cytokines but indicate their susceptibility to nitric oxide mediated apoptosis. In addition to promoting myofibroblast differentiation transforming growth factor 1 TGF 1 provides protection against apoptosis. Thus this well known fibrogenic cytokine is important both for the emergence of the myofibroblast and its survival against apoptotic stimuli. This is consistent with the critical importance of this cytokine in diverse models of fibrosis in various tissues. In view of these properties the persistence or prolonged survival of the myofibroblast may be the key to understanding why certain forms of lung injury may result in progressive disease terminating in end stage disease.

Although pulmonary fibrosis has diverse etiologies there is a common feature characteristic of this process namely the abnormal deposition of extracellular matrix that effaces the normal lung tissue architecture. A key cellular source of this matrix is the mesenchymal cell population that occupies much of the fibrotic lesion during the active period of fibrosis. This population is heterogeneous with respect to a number of key phenotypes. One of these phenotypes is the myofibroblast which is commonly identified by its expression in smooth muscle actin and by features that are intermediate between the bona fide smooth muscle cell and the fibroblast. The de novo appearance of myofibroblasts at sites of wound healing and tissue repair fibrosis is associated with the period of active fibrosis and is considered to be involved in wound contraction. Furthermore the localization of myofibroblasts at sites undergoing active extracellular matrix deposition suggests an important role for these cells in the genesis of the fibrotic lesion.

The transforming growth factor TGF family of proteins has the most potent stimulatory effect on extracellular matrix deposition of any cytokines so far examined. In animal models of pulmonary fibrosis enhanced TGF gene expression is temporally and spatially related to increased collagen gene expression and protein deposition. TGF antibodies reduce collagen deposition in murine bleomycin induced lung fibrosis and human fibrotic lung tissue shows enhanced TGF gene and protein expression. Several lines of evidence suggest that TGF is a central regulator of pulmonary fibrosis. Several animal models over expressing TGF showed extensive progressive fibrosis but limited inflammation indicating that TGF may play a predominant role in the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. Therapeutic efforts are therefore focusing on inhibition of TGF activity for instance by anti TGF 1 antibodies or modulators of TGF 1 such as pirfenidone. Pirfenidone inhibits TGF 1 gene expression in vivo resulting in inhibition of TGF 1 mediated collagen synthesis and appears to slow progression of IPF in patients. Other novel promising antifibrotic agents include relaxin inhibits TGF mediated overexpression of collagen and increases collagenases suramin inhibits growth factors prostaglandin E2 inhibits collagen production and lovastatin blocks formation of granulation tissue by induction of fibroblast apoptosis .

Diseases involving the lung associated with increased levels of TGF include chronic lung disease of prematurity idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis rapid progressive pulmonary fibrosis giant cell interstitial pneumonia acute rejection after lung transplantation cytomegalovirus pneumonitis after lung transplantation bronchiolitis obliterans asbestosis coal worker s pneumoconiosis silicosis histiocytosis sarcoidosis eosinophilic granuloma scleroderma systemic lupus erythematosus lymphangioleiomyomatosis central fibrosis in pulmonary adenocarcinoma cystic fibrosis chronic obstructive lung disease and asthma.

An important role of tumor necrosis factor TNF in interstitial fibrosis has been established using transgenic mice which either overexpress or display a deficiency of this cytokine. Mice transgenically modified to overexpress TNF develop lung fibrosis. In contrast mice null for TNF show marked resistance to bleomycin induced fibrosis. TNF can stimulate fibroblast replication and collagen synthesis in vitro and pulmonary TNF gene expression rises after administration of bleomycin in mice. Soluble TNF receptors reduce lung fibrosis in murine models and pulmonary overexpression of TNF in transgenic mice is characterized by lung fibrosis. In patients with CFA or asbestosis bronchoalveolar lavage fluid derived macrophages release increased amounts of TNF compared with controls.

Increased TNF may induce fibrosis or fibrosis associated conditions affecting any tissue including for example fibrosis of an internal organ a cutaneous or dermal fibrosing disorder and fibrotic conditions of the eye. Fibrosis of internal organs e.g. liver lung kidney heart blood vessels gastrointestinal tract occurs in disorders such as pulmonary fibrosis idiopathic fibrosis autoimmune fibrosis myelofibrosis liver cirrhosis veno occlusive disease mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis crescentic glomerulonephritis diabetic nephropathy renal interstitial fibrosis renal fibrosis in subjects receiving cyclosporin allograft rejection HTV associated nephropathy. Other fibrosis associated disorders include systemic sclerosis eosinophilia myalgia syndrome and fibrosis associated CNS disorders such as intraocular fibrosis. Dermal fibrosing disorders include for example scleroderma morphea keloids hypertrophic scars familial cutaneous collagenoma and connective tissue nevi of the collagen type. Fibrotic conditions of the eye include conditions such as diabetic retinopathy post surgical scarring for example after glaucoma filtering surgery and after crossed eyes strabismus surgery and proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Additional fibrotic conditions that may be treated by the methods of the present invention may result for example from rheumatoid arthritis diseases associated with prolonged joint pain and deteriorated joints progressive systemic sclerosis polymyositis dermatomyositis eosinophilic fascitis morphea Raynaud s syndrome and nasal polyposis.

The abnormal extracellular matrix ECM remodeling observed in the lungs of patients with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis IPF is due at least in part to an imbalance between matrix metalloproteases MMPs and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases TIMPs . Normal lung fibroblasts do not make MMP 9 in vitro whereas fibroblasts from IPF lungs strongly express MMP 9. In addition fibroblasts from patients with IPF express increased levels of all TIMPs. In this setting TIMPs may play a role in apoptosis in some cell populations. In vitro studies of alveolar macrophages obtained from untreated patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis showed marked increase in MMP 9 secretion compared to macrophages collected from healthy individuals. In animals models of bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis MMPs have been shown to be elevated in bronchoalveolar lavage BAL fluid. Indeed a synthetic inhibitor of MMP Batimastat has been shown to significantly reduce bleomycin induced lung fibrosis again pointing to the importance of MMPs in the development of this fibrotic disease in the lung. A number of studies have shown that the actions of MMPs can result in the release of growth factors and cytokines. These profibrotic factors require proteolytic processing for their activation or release from extracellular matrix or carrier proteins before they can exert their activity. In fact the proteolytic activity processing of several key factors involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis such as insulin like growth factor IGF TGF and TNF occur through the actions of MMPs thereby activating or releasing them from inhibitory protein protein interactions. For example IGFs in vivo are sequestered by six high affinity IGF binding proteins IGFBPs1 6 preventing their ability to interact with IGF receptors. Studies examining adults and children IPF and interstitial lung disease show that beside IPF IGFBP 3 and IFPB 2 levels are increased in IPF BAL fluid. MMPs have recently been shown to regulate the cleavage of IGF binding proteins thereby liberating the complexed ligand to affect IGF actions in target cells. Observations have also shown that the gelatinases MMP 9 and MMP 2 may be involved in proteolytic activation of latent TGF complexes. Furthermore the MMP inhibitor Batimastat reduces MMP 9 activity in BAL fluid which was associated with decreased amount of TGF and TNF .

Pulmonary fibrosis can be an all too common consequence of an acute inflammatory response of the lung to a host of inciting events. Chronic lung injury due to fibrotic changes can result from an identifiable inflammatory event or an insidious unknown event. The inflammatory process can include infiltration of various inflammatory cell types such as neutrophils and macrophages the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and the secretion of matrix remodeling proteinases.

The expression and regulation of cysteine cysteine CC chemokine ligand 18 CCL18 a marker of alternative activation by human alveolar macrophages AMs is increased in patients with pulmonary fibrosis and correlates negatively with pulmonary function test parameters. Thus CCL18 is an ideal diagnostic marker for pulmonary fibrosis.

The peptide or the peptide combination of the present invention were tested using the assays described in Examples 14 15 for their effect as active therapeutic agents in the prophylaxis and or treatment of fibrotic diseases and disorders.

Inflammation is the final common pathway of various insults such as infection trauma and allergies to the human body. It is characterized by activation of the immune system with recruitment of inflammatory cells production of pro inflammatory cells and production of pro inflammatory cytokines. Most inflammatory diseases and disorders are characterized by abnormal accumulation of inflammatory cells including monocytes macrophages granulocytes plasma cells lymphocytes and platelets. Along with tissue endothelial cells and fibroblasts these inflammatory cells release a complex array of lipids growth factors cytokines and destructive enzymes that cause local tissue damage.

One form of inflammatory response is neutrophilic inflammation which is characterized by infiltration of the inflamed tissue by neutrophil polymorphonuclear leukocytes PMN which are a major component of the host defense. Tissue infection by extracellular bacteria represents the prototype of this inflammatory response. On the other hand various non infectious diseases are characterized by extravascular recruitment of neutrophils. This group of inflammatory diseases includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease adult respiratory distress syndrome some types of immune complex alveolitis cystic fibrosis bronchitis bronchiectasis emphysema glomerulonephritis rheumatoid arthritis gouty arthritis ulcerative colitis certain dermatoses such as psoriasis and vasculitis. In these conditions neutrophils are thought to play a crucial role in the development of tissue injury which when persistent can lead to the irreversible destruction of the normal tissue architecture with consequent organ dysfunction. Tissue damage is primarily caused by the activation of neutrophils followed by their release of proteinases and increased production of oxygen species.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD is described by the progressive development of airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. Most patients with COPD have three pathological conditions bronchitis emphysema and mucus plugging. This disease is characterized by a slowly progressive and irreversible decrease in forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration FEVi with relative preservation of forced vital capacity FVC . In both asthma and COPD there is significant but distinct remodeling of airways. Most of the airflow obstruction is due to two major components alveolar destruction emphysema and small airways obstruction chronic obstructive bronchitis . COPD is mainly characterized by profound mucus cell hyperplasia. Neutrophil infiltration of the patient s lungs is a primary characteristic of COPD. Elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines like TNF and especially chemokines like interleukin 8 IL 8 and growth regulated oncogene GRO play a very important role in pathogenesis of this disease. Platelet thromboxane synthesis is also enhanced in patients with COPD. Most of the tissue damage is caused by activation of neutrophils followed by their release of metalloproteinases and increased production of oxygen species.

TNF has several biologic activities that are important in homeostasis as well as in pathophysiological conditions. The main sources of TNF are monocytes macrophages T lymphocytes and mast cells. The finding that anti TNF antibodies cA2 are effective in the treatment of patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis RA intensified the interest to find new TNF inhibitors as possible potent medicaments for RA. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune chronic inflammatory disease characterized by irreversible pathological changes of the joints. In addition to RA TNF antagonists are also applicable to several other pathological conditions and diseases such as spondylitis osteoarthritis gout and other arthritic conditions sepsis septic shock toxic shock syndrome atopic dermatitis contact dermatitis psoriasis glomerulonephritis lupus erythematosus scleroderma asthma cachexia chronic obstructive lung disease congestive heart failure insulin resistance lung pulmonary fibrosis multiple sclerosis Crohn s disease ulcerative colitis viral infections and AIDS.

The term immunoinflammatory disorder encompasses a variety of conditions including autoimmune diseases proliferative skin diseases and inflammatory dermatoses. Immunoinflammatory disorders result in the destruction of healthy tissue by an inflammatory process dysregulation of the immune system and unwanted proliferation of cells. Examples of immunoinflammatory disorders are acne vulgaris acute respiratory distress syndrome Addison s disease allergic rhinitis allergic intraocular inflammatory diseases antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ANCA associated small vessel vasculitis ankylosing spondylitis arthritis asthma atherosclerosis atopic dermatitis autoimmune hepatitis autoimmune hemolytic anemia autoimmune hepatitis Behcet s disease Bell s palsy bullous pemphigoid cerebral ischemia chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cirrhosis Cogan s syndrome contact dermatitis COPD Crohn s disease Cushing s syndrome dermatomyositis diabetes mellitus discoid lupus erythematosus eosinophilic fasciitis erythema nodosum exfoliative dermatitis fibromyalgia focal glomerulosclerosis focal segmental glomerulosclerosis giant cell arteritis gout gouty arthritis graft versus host disease hand eczema Henoch Schonlein purpura herpes gestationis hirsutism idiopathic cerato scleritis idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura immune thrombocytopenic purpura inflammatory bowel or gastrointestinal disorders inflammatory dermatoses lichen planus lupus nephritis lymphomatous tracheobronchitis macular edema multiple sclerosis myasthenia gravis myositis nonspecific fibrosing lung disease osteoarthritis pancreatitis pemphigoid gestationis pemphigus vulgaris periodontitis polyarteritis nodosa polymyalgia rheumatica pruritus scroti pruritis inflammation psoriasis psoriatic arthritis pulmonary histoplasmosis rheumatoid arthritis relapsing polychondritis rosacea caused by sarcoidosis rosacea caused by scleroderma rosacea caused by Sweet s syndrome rosacea caused by systemic lupus erythematosus rosacea caused by urticaria rosacea caused by zoster associated pain sarcoidosis scleroderma segmental glomerulosclerosis septic shock syndrome shoulder tendinitis or bursitis Sjogren s syndrome Still s disease stroke induced brain cell death Sweet s disease systemic lupus erythematosus systemic sclerosis Takayasu s arteritis temporal arteritis toxic epidermal necrolysis transplant rejection and transplant rejection related syndromes tuberculosis type 1 diabetes ulcerative colitis uveitis vasculitis and Wegener s granulomatosis.

As used herein non dermal inflammatory disorders include for example rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory bowel disease asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. By dermal inflammatory disorders or inflammatory dermatoses is meant an inflammatory disorder selected from psoriasis guttate psoriasis inverse psoriasis pustular psoriasis erythrodermic psoriasis acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis eczema asteatotic eczema dyshidrotic eczema vesicular palmoplantar eczema acne vulgaris atopic dermatitis contact dermatitis allergic contact dermatitis dermatomyositis exfoliative dermatitis hand eczema pompholyx rosacea rosacea caused by sarcoidosis rosacea caused by scleroderma rosacea caused by Sweet s syndrome rosacea caused by systemic lupus erythematosus rosacea caused by urticaria rosacea caused by zoster associated pain Sweet s disease neutrophilic hidradenitis sterile pustulosis drug eruptions seborrheic dermatitis pityriasis rosea cutaneous kikuchi disease pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy Stevens Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis tattoo reactions Wells syndrome eosinophilic cellulitis reactive arthritis Reiter s syndrome bowel associated dermatosis arthritis syndrome rheumatoid neutrophilic dermatosis neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis neutrophilic dermatosis of the dorsal hands balanitis circumscripta plasmacellularis balanoposthitis Behcet s disease erythema annulare centrifugum erythema dyschromicum perstans erythema multiforme granuloma annulare hand dermatitis lichen nitidus lichen planus lichen sclerosus et atrophicus lichen simplex chronicus lichen spinulosus nummular dermatitis pyoderma gangrenosum sarcoidosis subcorneal pustular dermatosis urticaria and transient acantholytic dermatosis.

By proliferative skin disease is meant a benign or malignant disease that is characterized by accelerated cell division in the epidermis or dermis. Examples of proliferative skin diseases are psoriasis atopic dermatitis nonspecific dermatitis primary irritant contact dermatitis allergic contact dermatitis basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin lamellar ichthyosis epidermolytic hyperkeratosis premalignant keratosis acne and seborrheic dermatitis. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art a particular disease disorder or condition may be characterized as being both a proliferative skin disease and an inflammatory dermatosis. An example of such a disease is psoriasis.

A human peptide is active in an inflammatory disease if the inhibition is 50 in one of the assays described below. Inhibition as percentage was calculated using the following formula inhibition 1 concentration of cytokines in sample concentration of cytokines in positive control 100. The positive control refers to stimulated samples not treated with substances.

Apoptosis or programmed cell death is defined as a mechanism which occurs after sufficient cellular damage. It is characteristically different from cell necrosis in morphology and biochemistry.

Apoptosis results in the condensation of the nucleus and the cell shrinks. Visible in apoptotic cells is chromosomal fragmentation due to the controlled digestion of DNA by apoptosis DNAses. Cytoplasmic blebbing and apoptotic bodies are also seen during apoptosis.

Research on apoptosis has increased substantially since the early 1990s. In addition to its importance as a biological phenomenon defective apoptotic processes have been implicated in an extensive variety of diseases. Excessive apoptosis causes hypotrophy such as in ischemic damage whereas an insufficient amount results in uncontrolled cell proliferation such as colorectal cancer glioma hepatic cancer neuroblastoma leukemia lymphoma prostate cancer myastenia gravis systemic lupus erythematosus bronchial asthma usual interstitial pneumonia or acute interstitial pneumonia.

Apoptosis is an integral part of tissue development. Development of an organ or tissue is often preceded by the extensive division and differentiation of a particular cell the resultant mass is then pruned into the correct form by apoptosis. Unlike cellular death caused by injury apoptosis results in cell shrinkage and fragmentation. This allows the cells to be efficiently phagocytosed and their components reused without releasing potentially harmful intracellular substances into the surrounding tissue.

The process of apoptosis is controlled by a diverse range of cell signals which may originate either extracellularly or intracellularly. Extracellular signals may include hormones growth factors nitric oxide or cytokines and therefore must either cross the plasma membrane or transduce to affect a response. These signals may positively or negatively induce apoptosis in this context the binding and subsequent initiation of apoptosis by a molecule is termed positive whereas the active repression of apoptosis by a molecule is termed negative.

Intracellular apoptotic signalling is a response initiated by a cell in response to stress and may ultimately result in cell suicide. The binding of nuclear receptors by glucocorticoids heat radiation nutrient deprivation viral infection and hypoxia are all factors that can lead to the release of intracellular apoptotic signals by a damaged cell.

Before the actual process of cell death is carried out by enzymes apoptotic signals must be connected to the actual death pathway by way of regulatory proteins. This step allows apoptotic signals to either culminate in cell death or be aborted should the cell no longer need to die. Several proteins are involved however two main methods of achieving regulation have been identified targeting mitochondria functionality or directly transducing the signal via adapter proteins to the apoptotic mechanisms. The whole preparation process requires energy and functioning cell machinery.

The mitochondria are essential to multicellular life. Without them a cell ceases to respire aerobically and quickly dies a fact exploited by some apoptotic pathways. Apoptotic proteins that target mitochondria affect them in different ways they may cause mitochondrial swelling through the formation of membrane pores or they may increase the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane and cause apoptotic effectors to leak out. Nitric oxide NO is able to induce apoptosis by helping to dissipate the membrane potential of mitochondria and therefore make it more permeable.

Mitochondrial proteins known as SMACs second mitochondria derived activator of caspases are released into the cytosol following an increase in permeability. SMAC binds to inhibitor of apoptosis proteins IAPs and deactivates them preventing the IAPs from arresting the apoptotic process and therefore allowing apoptosis to proceed. IAP also normally suppresses the activity of a group of cysteine proteases called caspases which carry out the degradation of the cell therefore the actual degradation enzymes can be seen to be indirectly regulated by mitochondrial permeability.

Although many pathways and signals lead to apoptosis there is only one mechanism that causes the death of the cell in this process after the appropriate stimulus has been received by the cell and the necessary controls exerted a cell will undergo the organized degradation of cellular organelles by activated proteolytic caspases. A cell undergoing apoptosis shows a characteristic morphology that can be observed with a microscope 

The cytoplasm appears dense and the organelles appear tightly packed. Chromatin undergoes condensation into compact patches against the nuclear envelope in a process known as pyknosis a hallmark of apoptosis.

The nuclear envelope becomes discontinuous and the DNA inside it is fragmented in a process referred to as karyorrhexis. The nucleus breaks into several discrete chromatin bodies or nucleosomal units due to the degradation of DNA.

Apoptosis can occur when a cell is damaged beyond repair infected with a virus or undertoing stress conditions such as starvation. DNA damage from ionizing radiation or toxic chemicals can also induce apoptosis via the actions of the tumor suppressing gene p53. The decision for apoptosis can come from the cell itself from the surrounding tissue or from a cell that is part of the immune system. In these cases apoptosis functions to remove the damaged cell preventing it from sapping further nutrients from the organism or to prevent the spread of viral infection.

Apoptosis also plays a role in preventing cancer if a cell is unable to undergo apoptosis due to mutation or biochemical inhibition it can continue dividing and develop into a tumor. For example infection by papillomaviruses causes a viral gene to interfere with the cell s p53 protein an important member of the apoptotic pathway. This interference in the apoptotic capability of the cell plays a critical role in the development of cervical cancer.

In the healthy organism the number of cells is kept relatively constant through cell death and division. Cells must be replaced when they become diseased or malfunctioning but proliferation must be compensated by cell death. This balancing process is part of the homeostasis required by living organisms to maintain their internal states within certain limits.

Homeostasis is achieved when the rate of mitosis cell division in the tissue is balanced by cell death. If this equilibrium is disturbed one of two potentially fatal disorders occurs 

The cells are dividing slower than they die which results in a disorder of cell loss. The organism must orchestrate a complex series of controls to keep homeostasis tightly controlled a process that is ongoing for the life of the organism and involves many different types of cell signaling. Impairment of any one of these controls can lead to a diseased state for example dysregulation of signaling pathway has been implicated in several forms of cancer.

T lymphocytes are a major source of cytokines. These cells bear antigen specific receptors on their cell surface to allow recognition of foreign pathogens. They can also recognize normal tissue during episodes of autoimmune diseases. There are two main subsets of T lymphocytes distinguished by the presence of cell surface molecules known as CD4 and CD8. T lymphocytes expressing CD4 are also known as helper T cells and these are regarded as being the most prolific cytokine producers. This subset can be further subdivided into Th1 and Th2 and the cytokines they produce are known as Th1 type cytokines and Th2 type cytokines. Th1 type cytokines tend to produce the pro inflammatory responses responsible for killing intracellular parasites and for perpetuating autoimmune responses. Interferon gamma is the main Th1 cytokine. Excessive pro inflammatory responses can lead to uncontrolled tissue damage so there needs to be a mechanism to counteract this. The Th2 type cytokines include Interleukin 4 Interleukin 5 and Interleukin 13 which are associated with the promotion of IgE and eosinophilic responses in atopy and also Interleukin 10 which has more of an anti inflammatory response. In excess Th2 responses will counteract the Th1 mediated microbicidal action. The optimal scenario would therefore seem to be that humans should produce a well balanced Th1 and Th2 response suited to the immune challenge.

Allergy is regarded as a Th2 weighted imbalance. Pregnancy and early postnatal life are also viewed as Th2 phenomena to reduce the risk of miscarriage a strong Th2 response is necessary to modify the Th1 cellular response in utero . The fetus can switch on an immune response early in pregnancy and because pregnancy is chiefly a Th2 situation babies tend to be born with Th2 biased immune responses. These can be switched off rapidly postnatally under the influence of microbiological exposure or can be enhanced by early exposure to allergens.

Th1 cells produce interferon gamma Interleukin 2 and tumor necrosis factor beta which activate macrophages and are responsible for cell mediated immunity and phagocyte dependent protective responses. By contrast Th2 cells produce cytokines which are responsible for strong antibody production eosinophil activation and inhibition of several macrophage functions thus providing phagocyte independent protective responses. Th1 cells mainly develop following infections by intracellular bacteria and some viruses whereas Th2 cells predominate in response to infestations by gastrointestinal nematodes. Polarized Th1 and Th2 cells not only exhibit different functional properties but also show the preferential expression of some activation markers and distinct transcription factors. Several mechanisms may influence the Th cell differentiation which include the cytokine profile of natural immunity evoked by different offending agents the nature of the peptide ligand as well as the activity of some costimulatory molecules and microenvironmentally secreted hormones in the context of the individual genetic background. In addition to playing different roles in protection polarized Th1 type and Th2 type responses are also responsible for different types of immunopathological reactions. Th1 cells are involved in the pathogenesis of organ specific autoimmune disorders like Crohn s disease is one induced peptic ulcer acute kidney allograft rejection unexplained recurrent abortions tuberculosis myocarditis multiple sclerosis scleroderma Type 1 diabetes rheumatoid arthritis RA sarcoidosis autoimmune thyroiditis and uveitis. In contrast allergen specific Th2 responses are responsible for atopic disorders in genetically susceptible individuals like asthma. Moreover Th2 responses against still unknown antigens predominate in Omenn s syndrome idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and progressive systemic sclerosis. Finally the prevalence of Th2 responses may play some role in a more rapid evolution of human immunodeficiency virus infection to the full blown disease.

It is object of current application to find peptides which produce a well balanced Th1 and Th2 response in situations of Th1 predominance in the situation of Th2 predominance or even at situations where both Th1 and Th2 cells are too much activated as exemplified after severe infections.

The peptide or the peptide combination of the present invention were tested using the assays described in Examples 1 7 9 18 for their effect as active therapeutic agents in the prophylaxis and or treatment of inflammatory diseases and disorders.

The present invention also relates generally to the fields of neurology and psychiatry and to methods of protecting the cells of a mammalian central nervous system from damage or injury.

Injuries or trauma of various kinds to the central nervous system CNS or the peripheral nervous system PNS can produce profound and long lasting neurological and or psychiatric symptoms and disorders. One form that this can take is the progressive death of neurons or other cells of the central nervous system CNS i.e. neurodegeneration or neuronal degeneration.

Neuronal degeneration as a result of for example Alzheimer s disease multiple sclerosis cerebral vascular accidents CVAs stroke traumatic brain injury spinal cord injuries degeneration of the optic nerve e.g. ischemic optic neuropathy or retinal degeneration and other central nervous system disorders is an enormous medical and public health problem by virtue of both its high incidence and the frequency of long term sequelae. Animal studies and clinical trials have shown that amino acid transmitters especially glutamate oxidative stress and inflammatory reactions contribute strongly to cell death in these conditions. Upon injury or upon ischemic insult damaged neurons release massive amounts of the neurotransmitter glutamate which is excitotoxic to the surrounding neurons. Glutamate is a negatively charged amino acid that is an excitatory synaptic transmitter in the mammalian nervous system. Although the concentration of glutamate can reach the millimolar range in nerve terminals its extracellular concentration is maintained at a low level to prevent neurotoxicity. It has been noted that glutamate can be toxic to neurons if presented at a high concentration. The term excitotoxicity has been used to describe the cytotoxic effect that glutamate and other such excitatory amino acids can have on neurons when applied at high dosages.

Patients with injury or damage of any kind to the central CNS or peripheral PNS nervous system including the retina may benefit from neuroprotective methods. This nervous system injury may take the form of an abrupt insult or an acute injury to the nervous system as in for example acute neurodegenerative disorders including but not limited to acute injury hypoxia ischemia or the combination thereof resulting in neuronal cell death or compromise. Acute injury includes but is not limited to traumatic brain injury TBI including closed blunt or penetrating brain trauma focal brain trauma diffuse brain damage spinal cord injury intracranial or intravertebral lesions including but not limited to contusion penetration shear compression or laceration lesions of the spinal cord or whiplash shaken infant syndrome .

In addition deprivation of oxygen or blood supply in general can cause acute injury as in hypoxia and or ischemia including but not limited to cerebrovascular insufficiency cerebral ischemia or cerebral infarction including cerebral ischemia or infarctions originating from embolic occlusion and thrombosis retinal ischemia diabetic or otherwise glaucoma retinal degeneration multiple sclerosis toxic and ischemic optic neuropathy reperfusion following acute ischemia perinatal hypoxic ischemic injury cardiac arrest or intracranial hemorrhage of any type including but not limited to epidural subdural subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage .

Trauma or injury to tissues of the nervous system may also take the form of more chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorders such as those associated with progressive neuronal cell death or compromise over a period of time including but not limited to Alzheimer s disease Pick s disease diffuse Lewy body disease progressive supranuclear palsy Steel Richardson syndrome multisystem degeneration Shy Drager syndrome chronic epileptic conditions associated with neurodegeneration motor neuron diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis multiple sclerosis degenerative ataxias cortical basal degeneration ALS Parkinson s dementia complex of Guam subacute sclerosing panencephalitis Huntington s disease Parkinson s disease synucleinopathies including multiple system atrophy primary progressive aphasia striatonigral degeneration Machado Joseph disease or spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 and olivopontocerebellar degenerations bulbar and pseudobulbar palsy spinal and spinobulbar muscular atrophy Kennedy s disease primary lateral sclerosis familial spastic paraplegia Werdnig Hoffmann disease Kugelberg Welander disease Tay Sach s disease Sandhoff disease familial spastic disease Wohlfart Kugelberg Welander disease spastic paraparesis progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy familial dysautonomia Riley Day syndrome or prion diseases including but not limited to Creutzfeld Jakob disease Gerstmann Strussler Scheinker disease Kuru disease or fatal familial insomnia .

The term neuroprotection as used herein shall mean inhibiting preventing ameliorating or reducing the severity of the dysfunction degeneration or death of nerve cells axons or their supporting cells in the central or peripheral nervous system of a mammal including a human. This includes the treatment or prophylaxis of a neurodegenerative disease protection against excitotoxicity or ameliorating the cytotoxic effect of a compound for example a excitatory amino acid such as glutamate a toxin or a prophylactic or therapeutic compound that exerts an immediate or delayed cytotoxic side effect including but not limited to the immediate or delayed induction of apoptosis in a patient in need thereof.

The term a patient in need of treatment with a neuroprotective drug as used herein will refer to any patient who currently has or may develop any of the above syndromes or disorders or any disorder in which the patient s present clinical condition or prognosis could benefit from providing neuroprotection to prevent the development extension worsening or increased resistance to treatment of any neurological or psychiatric disorder.

The term treating or treatment as used herein refers to any indicia of success in the prevention or amelioration of an injury pathology or condition including any objective or subjective parameter such as abatement remission diminishing of symptoms or making the injury pathology or condition more tolerable to the patient slowing in the rate of degeneration or decline making the final point of degeneration less debilitating or improving a subject s physical or mental well being. The treatment or amelioration of symptoms can be based on objective or subjective parameters including the results of a physical examination neurological examination and or psychiatric evaluations.

In some embodiments this invention provides methods of neuroprotection. In certain embodiments these methods comprise administering a therapeutically effective amount of the peptide combination of the invention to a patient who has not yet developed overt clinical signs or symptoms of injury or damage to the cells of the nervous system but who may be in a high risk group for the development of neuronal damage because of injury or trauma to the nervous system or because of some known predisposition either biochemical or genetic or the finding of a verified biomarker of one or more of these disorders.

Thus in some embodiments the methods and compositions of the present invention are directed toward neuroprotection in a subject who is at risk of developing neuronal damage but who has not yet developed clinical evidence. This patient may simply be at greater risk as determined by the recognition of any factor in a subject s or their families medical history physical exam or testing that is indicative of a greater than average risk for developing neuronal damage. Therefore this determination that a patient may be at a greater risk by any available means can be used to determine whether the patient should be treated with the methods of the present invention.

Accordingly in an exemplary embodiment subjects who may benefit from treatment by the methods and the peptide or the peptide combination of this invention can be identified using accepted screening methods to determine risk factors for neuronal damage. These screening methods include for example conventional work ups to determine risk factors including but not limited to for example head trauma either closed or penetrating CNS infections bacterial or viral cerebrovascular disease including but not limited to stroke brain tumors brain edema cysticercosis porphyria metabolic encephalopathy drug withdrawal including but not limited to sedative hypnotic or alcohol withdrawal abnormal perinatal history including anoxia at birth or birth injury of any kind cerebral palsy learning disabilities hyperactivity history of febrile convulsions as a child history of status epilepticus family history of epilepsy or any seizure related disorder inflammatory disease of the brain including lupis drug intoxication either direct or by placental transfer including but not limited to cocaine poisoning parental consanguinity and treatment with medications that are toxic to the nervous system including psychotropic medications.

The determination of which patients may benefit from treatment with a neuroprotective drug in patients who have no clinical signs or symptoms may be based on a variety of surrogate markers or biomarkers .

As used herein the terms surrogate marker and biomarker are used interchangeably and refer to any anatomical biochemical structural electrical genetic or chemical indicator or marker that can be reliably correlated with the present existence or future development of neuronal damage. In some instances brain imaging techniques such as computer tomography CT magnetic resonance imaging MRI or positron emission tomography PET can be used to determine whether a subject is at risk for neuronal damage. Suitable biomarkers for the methods of this invention include but are not limited to the determination by MRI CT or other imaging techniques of sclerosis atrophy or volume loss in the hippocampus or overt mesial temporal sclerosis MTS or similar relevant anatomical pathology the detection in the patient s blood serum or tissues of a molecular species such as a protein or other biochemical biomarker e.g. elevated levels of ciliary neurotrophic factor CNTF or elevated serum levels of a neuronal degradation product or other evidence from surrogate markers or biomarkers that the patient is in need of treatment with a neuroprotective drug.

It is expected that many more such biomarkers utilizing a wide variety of detection techniques will be developed in the future. It is intended that any such marker or indicator of the existence or possible future development of neuronal damage as the latter term is used herein may be used in the methods of this invention for determining the need for treatment with the compounds and methods of this invention.

A determination that a subject has or may be at risk for developing neuronal damage would also include for example a medical evaluation that includes a thorough history a physical examination and a series of relevant bloods tests. It can also include an electroencephalogram EEG CT MRI or PET scan. A determination of an increased risk of developing neuronal damage or injury may also be made by means of genetic testing including gene expression profiling or proteomic techniques. For psychiatric disorders that may be stabilized or improved by a neuroprotective drug e.g. bipolar disorder schizoaffective disorder schizophrenia impulse control disorders etc. the above tests may also include a present state exam and a detailed history of the course of the patients symptoms such as mood disorder symptoms and psychotic symptoms over time and in relation to other treatments the patient may have received over time e.g. a life chart. These and other specialized and routine methods allow the clinician to select patients in need of therapy using the methods and formulations of this invention. In some embodiments of the present invention peptides suitable for use in the practice of this invention will be administered either singly or concomitantly with at least one or more other compounds or therapeutic agents e.g. with other neuroprotective drugs or antiepileptic drugs anticonvulsant drugs. In these embodiments the present invention provides methods to treat or prevent neuronal injury in a patient. The method includes the step of administering to a patient in need of treatment an effective amount of one of the peptides disclosed herein in combination with an effective amount of one or more other compounds or therapeutic agents that have the ability to provide neuroprotection or to treat or prevent seizures or epileptogenesis or the ability to augment the neuroprotective effects of the compounds of the invention.

As used herein the term combination administration of a compound therapeutic agent or known drug with the peptide combination of the present invention means administration of the drug and the one or more compounds at such time that both the known drug and the peptide combination will have a therapeutic effect. In some cases this therapeutic effect will be synergistic. Such concomitant administration can involve concurrent i.e. at the same time prior or subsequent administration of the drug with respect to the administration of the peptide combination of the present invention. A person of ordinary skill in the art would have no difficulty determining the appropriate timing sequence and dosages of administration for particular drugs and peptides of the present invention.

The said one or more other compounds or therapeutic agents may be selected from compounds that have one or more of the following properties antioxidant activity NMDA receptor antagonist activity augmentation of endogenous GABA inhibition NO synthase inhibitor activity iron binding ability e.g. an iron chelator calcium binding ability e.g. a Ca II chelator zinc binding ability e.g. a Zn II chelator the ability to effectively block sodium or calcium ion channels or to open potassium or chloride ion channels in the CNS of a patient.

The peptide or the peptide combination of the present invention were tested using the assays described in Examples 1 7 9 18 for their effect as active therapeutic agents in the prophylaxis and or treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and disorders.

Heart disease is a general term used to describe many different heart conditions. For example coronary artery disease which is the most common heart disease is characterized by constriction or narrowing of the arteries supplying the heart with oxygen rich blood and can lead to myocardial infarction which is the death of a portion of the heart muscle. Heart failure is a condition resulting from the inability of the heart to pump an adequate amount of blood through the body. Heart failure is not a sudden abrupt stop of heart activity but rather typically develops slowly over many years as the heart gradually loses its ability to pump blood efficiently. Risk factors for heart failure include coronary artery disease hypertension valvular heart disease cardiomyopathy disease of the heart muscle obesity diabetes and or a family history of heart failure.

Examples of cardiovascular diseases and disorders are aneurysm stable angina unstable angina angina pectoris angioneurotic edema aortic valve stenosis aortic aneurysm arrhythmia arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia arteriosclerosis arteriovenous malformations atrial fibrillation Behcet syndrome bradycardia cardiac tamponade cardiomegaly congestive card iomyopathy hypertrophic cardiomyopathy restrictive cardiomyopathy carotid stenosis cerebral hemorrhage Churg Strauss syndrome diabetes Ebstein s Anomaly Eisenmenger complex cholesterol embolism bacterial endocarditis fibromuscular dysplasia congenital heart defects heart diseases congestive heart failure heart valve diseases heart attack epidural hematoma hematoma subdural Hippel Lindau disease hyperemia hypertension pulmonary hypertension cardiac hypertrophy left ventricular hypertrophy right ventricular hypertrophy hypoplastic left heart syndrome hypotension intermittent claudication ischemic heart disease Klippel Trenaunay Weber syndrome lateral medullary syndrome long QT syndrome mitral valve prolapse moyamoya disease mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome myocardial infarction myocardial ischemia myocarditis pericarditis peripheral vascular diseases phlebitis polyarteritis nodosa pulmonary atresia Raynaud disease Sneddon syndrome superior vena cava syndrome syndrome X tachycardia Takayasu s arteritis hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia telangiectasis temporal arteritis tetralogy of Fallot thromboangiitis obliterans thrombosis thromboembolism tricuspid atresia varicose veins vascular diseases vasculitis vasospasm ventricular fibrillation Williams syndrome peripheral vascular disease varicose veins and leg ulcers deep vein thrombosis Wolff Parkinson White syndrome.

Vascular diseases are often the result of decreased perfusion in the vascular system or physical or biochemical injury to the blood vessel.

Peripheral vascular disease PVD is defined as a disease of blood vessels often encountered as narrowing of the vessels of the limbs. There are two main types of these disorders functional disease which doesn t involve defects in the blood vessels but rather arises from stimuli such as cold stress or smoking and organic disease which arises from structural defects in the vasculature such as atherosclerotic lesions local inflammation or traumatic injury. This can lead to occlusion of the vessel aberrant blood flow and ultimately to tissue ischemia.

One of the more clinically significant forms of PVD is peripheral artery disease PAD . PAD is often treated by angioplasty and implantation of a stent or by artery bypass surgery. Clinical presentation depends on the location of the occluded vessel. For example narrowing of the artery that supplies blood to the intestine can result in severe postprandial pain in the lower abdomen resulting from the inability of the occluded vessel to meet the increased oxygen demand arising from digestive and absorptive processes. In severe forms the ischemia can lead to intestinal necrosis. Similarly PAD in the leg can lead to intermittent pain usually in the calf that comes and goes with activity. This disorder is known as intermittent claudication IC and can progress to persistent pain while resting ischemic ulceration and even amputation.

Peripheral vascular disease is also manifested in atherosclerotic stenosis of the renal artery which can lead to renal ischemia and kidney dysfunction.

One disease in which vascular diseases and their complications are very common is diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus causes a variety of physiological and anatomical irregularities the most prominent of which is the inability of the body to utilize glucose normally which results in hyperglycemia. Chronic diabetes can lead to complications of the vascular system which include atherosclerosis abnormalities involving large and medium size blood vessels macroangiopathy and abnormalities involving small blood vessels microangiopathy such as arterioles and capillaries.

Patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of developing one or more foot ulcers as a result of established long term complications of the disease which include impaired nerve function neuropathy and or ischemia. Local tissue ischemia is a key contributing factor to diabetic foot ulceration.

In addition to large vessel disease patients with diabetes suffer further threat to their skin perfusion in at least two additional ways. First by involvement of the non conduit arteries which are detrimentally affected by the process of atherosclerosis and secondly and perhaps more importantly by impairment of the microcirculatory control mechanisms small vessel disease . Normally when a body part suffers some form of trauma the body part will as part of the body s healing mechanism experience an increased blood flow. When small vessel disease and ischemia are both present as in the case of many diabetics this natural increased blood flow response is significantly reduced. This fact together with the tendency of diabetics to form blood clots thrombosis in the microcirculatory system during low levels of blood flow is believed to be an important factor in ulcer pathogenesis.

Neuropathy is a general term which describes a disease process which leads to the dysfunction of the nervous system and is one of the major complications of diabetes mellitus with no well established therapies for either its symptomatic treatment or for prevention of progressive decline in nerve function.

The thickening and leakage of capillaries caused by diabetes primarily affect the eyes retinopathy and kidneys nephropathy . The thickening and leakage of capillaries caused by diabetes are also associated with skin disorders and disorders of the nervous system neuropathy .

The eye diseases associated with diabetes are nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy proliferative diabetic retinopathy diabetic maculopathy glaucoma cataracts and the like.

Other diseases although not known to be related to diabetes are similar in their physiological effects on the peripheral vascular system. Such diseases include Raynaud syndrome CREST syndrome autoimmune diseases such as erythematosis rheumatoid disease and the like.

As used herein the term peripheral vascular diseases comprises any peripheral vascular disease including peripheral and autonomic neuropathies. Examples of peripheral vascular disease include peripheral arterial disease such as chronic arterial occlusion including arteriosclerosis arteriosclerosis obliterans and thromboangiitis obliterans Buerger s disease macroangiopathy microangiopathy diabetes mellitus thrombophlebitis phlebemphraxis Raynaud s disease Raynaud s syndrome CREST syndrome health hazard due to vibration Sudeck s syndrome intermittent claudication cold sense in extremities abnormal sensation in extremities sensitivity to the cold Meniere s disease Meniere s syndrome numbness lack of sensation anesthesia resting pain causalgia burning pain disturbance of peripheral circulation function disturbance of nerve function disturbance of motor function motor paralysis diabetic peripheral circulation disorder lumbar spinal canal stenosis diabetic neuropathy shock autoimmune disease such as erythematosis rheumatoid disease and rheumatoid arthritis autonomic neuropathy diabetic autonomic neuropathy autonomic imbalance orthostatic hypotension erectile dysfunction female sexual dysfunction retrograde ejaculation cystopathy neurogenic bladder defective vaginal lubrication exercise intolerance cardiac denervation heat intolerance gustatory sweating diabetic complication hyperglycemia hypoglycemia unawareness hypoglycemia unresponsiveness glaucoma neovascular glaucoma cataract retinopathy diabetic retinopathy diabetic maculopathy occlusion of retinal artery obstruction of central artery of retina occlusion of retinal vein macular edema aged macular degeneration aged disciform macular degeneration cystoid macular edema palpebral edema retinal edema chorioretinopathy neovascular maculopathy uveitis iritis retinal vasculitis endophthalmitis panophthalmitis metastatic ophthalmia choroiditis retinal pigment epithelitis conjunctivitis cyclitis scleritis episcleritis optic neuritis retrobulbar optic neuritis keratitis blepharitis exudative retinal detachment corneal ulcer conjunctival ulcer chronic nummular keratitis Thygeson keratitis progressive Mooren s ulcer damage of skin skin ulcer including foot ulcer diabetic ulcer burn ulcer lower leg ulcer postoperative ulcer traumatic ulcer ulcer after herpes zoster radiation ulcer drug induced ulcer frostbite cold injury chilblain gangrene and sudden gangrene angina pectoris variant angiitis coronary arteriosclerosis chronic ischemic heart disease asymptomatic ischemic heart disease arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease myocardial infarction heart failure congestive heart failure and painless ischemic heart disease pulmonary edema hypertension pulmonary hypertension portal hypertension diabetic nephropathy decubitus renal failure.

Furthermore the present invention also includes pharmaceutical preparations for parenteral application including dermal intradermal intragastral intracutan intravasal intravenous intramuscular intraperitoneal intranasal intravaginal intrabuccal percutan rectal subcutaneous sublingual topical or transdermal application which preparations in addition to typical vehicles and or diluents contain the peptide or peptide combination according to the present invention.

The present invention also includes mammalian milk artificial mammalian milk as well as mammalian milk substitutes as a formulation for oral administration of the peptide combination to newborns toddlers and infants either as pharmaceutical preparations and or as dietary food supplements.

The peptide or the peptide combination of the invention can also be administered in form of its pharmaceutically active salts. Suitable pharmaceutically active salts comprise acid addition salts and alkali or earth alkali salts. For instance sodium potassium lithium magnesium or calcium salts can be obtained.

The peptide or the peptide combination of the invention forms pharmaceutically acceptable salts with organic and inorganic acids. Examples of suitable acids for such acid addition salt formation are hydrochloric acid hydrobromic acid sulfuric acid phosphoric acid acetic acid citric acid oxalic acid malonic acid salicylic acid p aminosalicylic acid malic acid fumaric acid succinic acid ascorbic acid maleic acid sulfonic acid phosphonic acid perchloric acid nitric acid formic acid propionic acid gluconic acid lactic acid tartaric acid hydroxymaleic acid pyruvic acid phenylacetic acid benzoic acid p aminobenzoic acid p hydroxybenzoic acid methanesulfonic acid ethanesulfonic acid nitrous acid hydroxyethanesulfonic acid ethylenesulfonic acid p toluenesulfonic acid naphthylsulfonic acid sulfanilic acid camphersulfonic acid china acid mandelic acid o methylmandelic acid hydrogen benzenesulfonic acid picric acid adipic acid D o tolyltartaric acid tartronic acid toluic acid o m p toluic acid naphthylamine sulfonic acid and other mineral or carboxylic acids well known to those skilled in the art. The salts are prepared by contacting the free base form with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce a salt in the conventional manner.

The pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention will typically be administered together with suitable carrier materials selected with respect to the intended form of administration i.e. for oral administration in the form of tablets capsules either solid filled semi solid filled or liquid filled powders for constitution aerosol preparations consistent with conventional pharmaceutical practices. Other suitable formulations are gels elixirs dispersible granules syrups suspensions creams lotions solutions emulsions suspensions dispersions and the like. Suitable dosage forms for sustained release include tablets having layers of varying disintegration rates or controlled release polymeric matrices impregnated with the active components and shaped in tablet form or capsules containing such impregnated or encapsulated porous polymeric matrices. The pharmaceutical compositions may be comprised of 5 to 95 by weight of the peptide or the peptide combination while also up to 100 of the pharmaceutical composition can consist of the peptide combination.

As pharmaceutically acceptable carrier excipient and or diluents can be used lactose starch sucrose cellulose magnesium stearate dicalcium phosphate calcium sulfate talc mannitol ethyl alcohol liquid filled capsules .

Suitable binders include starch gelatin natural sugars corn sweeteners natural and synthetic gums such as acacia sodium alginate carboxymethyl cellulose polyethylene glycol and waxes. Among the lubricants that may be mentioned for use in these dosage forms boric acid sodium benzoate sodium acetate sodium chloride and the like. Disintegrants include starch methylcellulose guar gum and the like. Sweetening and flavoring agents and preservatives may also be included where appropriate. Some of the terms noted above namely disintegrants diluents lubricants binders and the like are discussed in more detail below.

Additionally the compositions of the present invention may be formulated in sustained release form to provide the rate controlled release of any one or more of the components or active ingredients to optimize the therapeutic effects. Suitable dosage forms for sustained release include layered tablets containing layers of varying disintegration rates or controlled release polymeric matrices impregnated with the active components and shaped in tablet form or capsules containing such impregnated or encapsulated porous polymeric matrices.

Aerosol preparations suitable for inhalation may include solutions and solids in powder form which may be in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as inert compressed gas e.g. nitrogen.

For preparing suppositories a low melting wax such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides such as cocoa butter is first melted and the active ingredient is dispersed homogeneously therein by stirring or similar mixing. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds allowed to cool and thereby solidify.

Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted shortly before use to liquid form preparations for either oral or parenteral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions suspensions and emulsions.

The peptide or the peptide combination of the present invention may also be deliverable transdermally. The transdermal compositions may take the form of creams lotions aerosols and or emulsions and can be included in a transdermal patch of the matrix or reservoir type as are conventional in the art for this purpose.

The transdermal formulation of the peptide or the peptide combination of the invention is understood to increase the bioavailability of said peptide into the circulating blood. One problem in the administration of peptide s is the loss of bioactivity due to the formation of insolubles in aqueous environments or due to degradation. Therefore stabilization of peptide s for maintaining their fluidity and maintaining their biological activity upon administration to the patients in need thereof needs to be achieved.

Prior efforts to provide active agents for medication include incorporating the medication in a polymeric matrix whereby the active ingredient is released into the systemic circulation. Known sustained release delivery means of active agents are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 235 988 4 188 373 4 100 271 447 471 4 474 752 4 474 753 or U.S. Pat. No. 4 478 822 relating to polymeric pharmaceutical vehicles for delivery of pharmaceutically active chemical materials to mucous membranes. The pharmaceutical carriers are aqueous solutions of certain polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene condensates. These polymeric pharmaceutical vehicles are described as providing for increased drug absorbtion by the mucous membrane and prolonged drug action by a factor of two or more. The substituents are block copolymers of polyoxypropylene and polyoxyethylene used for stabilization of drugs such as insulin.

Aqueous solutions of polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene block copolymers poloxamers are useful as stabilizers for peptide s . Aside from serving as a stabilizer for the peptide s poloxamers provide excellent vehicles for the delivery of the peptide s and they are physiologically acceptable. Poloxamers also known by the trade name Pluronics e.g. Pluronic F127 Pluronic P85 Pluronic F68 have surfactant properties that make them useful in industrial applications. Among other things they can be used to increase the water solubility of hydrophobic oily substances or otherwise increase the miscibility of two substances with different hydrophobicities. For this reason these polymers are commonly used in industrial applications cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. They have also been used as model systems for drug delivery applications. In situ gelation of pharmaceutical compositions based on poloxamer that are biologically triggered are known in the art e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 256 396 describing compositions containing poloxamer 407 and water at specified concentrations.

The term capsule refers to a special container or enclosure made of methyl cellulose polyvinyl alcohols or denatured gelatins or starch for holding or containing compositions comprising the active ingredients. Hard shell capsules are typically made of blends of relatively high gel strength bone and pork skin gelatins. The capsule itself may contain small amounts of dyes opaquing agents plasticizers and preservatives.

Tablet means compressed or molded solid dosage form containing the active ingredients with suitable diluents. The tablet can be prepared by compression of mixtures or granulations obtained by wet granulation dry granulation or by compaction well known to a person skilled in the art.

Oral gels refers to the active ingredients dispersed or solubilized in a hydrophilic semi solid matrix.

Powders for constitution refer to powder blends containing the active ingredients and suitable diluents which can be suspended in water or juices. One example for such an oral administration form for newborns toddlers and or infants is a human breast milk substitute which is produced from milk powder and milk whey powder optionally and partially substituted with lactose.

Human breast milk is a complex fluid rich in nutrients and in non nutritional bioactive components. It contains all of the nutrients needed by the newborn baby. These include the metabolic components fat protein and carbohydrates water and the raw materials for tissue growth and development such as fatty acids amino acids minerals vitamins and trace elements.

More than 98 of the fat in is in the form of triglycerides. Oleic acid and palmitic acid are the most abundant fatty acids in breastmilk triglycerides with comparatively high proportions of the essential fatty acids and linolenic acid followed by long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. These long chain fatty acids are constituents of brain and neural tissue and are needed in early life for mental and visual development. The lipid component of breast milk is the transport vehicle for fat soluble micronutrients such as prostaglandins and vitamins A D E and K.

Proteins account for approximately 75 of the nitrogen containing compounds in breast milk. Non protein nitrogen substances include urea nucleotides peptides free amino acids and DNA. The proteins of breast milk can be divided into two categories micellar caseins and aqueous whey proteins present in the ratio of about 40 60. Casein forms micelles of relatively small volume and produces a soft flocculent curd in the infant s stomach. The major whey proteins are lactalbumin lactoferrin secretory IgA and serum albumin with a large number of other proteins and peptides present in smaller amounts.

The principal carbohydrate is lactose a disaccharide produced in the mammary epithelial cell from glucose by a reaction involving lactalbumin. In addition to the nutritional components breast milk contains a wealth of bioactive components that have beneficial non nutritional functions. These include a wide range of specific and non specific antimicrobial factors cytokines and anti inflammatory substances and hormones growth modulators and digestive enzymes Table 1 many of which have multiple activities. These components may be of particular importance for young infants because of the immaturity of the host defense and digestive systems early in life.

Besides breast milk infant formula is the only other infant milk which the medical community considers nutritionally acceptable for infants under the age of one year.

Cow s milk is not recommended because of its high protein and electrolyte salt content which may harm infant s immature kidneys. The nutrient content of infant formula should comprise Protein Fat Linoleic acid Vitamins A C D E K thiamin B1 riboflavin B2 B6 B12 Niacin Folic acid Pantothenic acid Calcium Metals magnesium iron zinc manganese copper Phosphorus Iodine Sodium chloride Potassium chloride. In addition formulas not made with cow s milk must include biotin choline and inositol. Hypoallergenic formulas reduce the likelihood of certain medical complications in babies with specific health problems. Baby formula can be synthesized from raw amino acids. This kind of formula is sometimes referred to as elemental infant formula or as medical food because of its specialized nature.

Powder blends containing the active ingredients and suitable diluents which can be suspended in water or juices can be produced by spray drying.

Spray drying has been found the most suitable process for removing the last part of the water since spray drying can convert milk concentrate into a powder while still keeping the valuable properties of the milk. The principle of all spray dryers is to transform the concentrate into many small droplets which are then exposed to a fast current of hot air. Because of the very large surface area of the droplets the water evaporates almost instantaneously and the droplets are transformed into powder particles.

Powdered milk is a powder made from dried milk solids. Powdered milk has a far longer shelf life than liquid milk and does not need to be refrigerated due to its low moisture content.

Instant milk powder is produced by partially rehydrating the dried milk powder particles causing them to become sticky and agglomerate. The water is then removed by drying resulting in an increased amount of air incorporated between the powder particles.

Milk powder manufacture is a process carried out on a large scale. It involves the gentle removal of water while retaining all the desirable natural properties of the milk like colour flavour solubility nutritional value.

Milk powder process includes spray drying fluid bed processing extraction evaporation and freeze drying. Other processes are freeze concentration filteration and homogenisation.

The artificial mother milk formulations or mother milk substitutes of the present invention are preferably prepared by adding to a mother milk formulation including commercially available mother milk formulations especially in powder form the peptide or inventive peptide combination. The peptide or peptide combination is preferably added in an amount of 3 100 g peptide or peptide combination per 100 ml commercially available mother milk formulation more preferably in an amount of 5 70 g 100 ml and most preferably in an amount of 10 40 g 100 ml mother milk formulation.

Suitable diluents are substances that usually make up the major portion of the composition or dosage form. Suitable diluents include sugars such as lactose sucrose mannitol and sorbitol starches derived from wheat corn rice and potato and celluloses such as microcrystalline cellulose. The amount of diluents in the composition can range from about 5 to about 95 by weight of the total composition preferably from about 25 to about 75 more preferably from about 30 to about 60 by weight and most preferably from about 40 to 50 by weight.

The term disintegrants refers to materials added to the composition to help it break apart disintegrate and release the medicaments. Suitable disintegrants include starches cold water soluble modified starches such as sodium carboxymethyl starch natural and synthetic gums such as locust bean karaya guar tragacanth and agar cellulose derivatives such as methylcellulose and sodium carboxymethylcellulose microcrystalline celluloses and cross linked microcrystalline celluloses such as sodium croscarmellose alginates such as alginic acid and sodium alginate clays such as bentonites and effervescent mixtures. The amount of disintegrant in the composition can range from about 1 to about 40 by weight of the composition preferably 2 to about 30 by weight of the composition more preferably from about 3 to 20 by weight of the composition and most preferably from about 5 to about 10 by weight.

Binders characterize substances that bind or glue powders together and make them cohesive by forming granules thus serving as the adhesive in the formulation. Binders add cohesive strength already available in the diluents or bulking agent. Suitable binders include sugars such as sucrose starches derived from wheat corn rice and potato natural gums such as acacia gelatin and tragacanth derivatives of seaweed such as alginic acid sodium alginate and ammonium calcium alginate cellulosic materials such as methylcellulose and sodium carboxymethylcellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose polyvinylpyrrolidone and inorganics such as magnesium aluminum silicate. The amount of binder in the composition can range from about 1 to 30 by weight of the composition preferably from about 2 to about 20 by weight of the composition more preferably from about 3 to about 10 by weight even more preferably from about 3 to about 6 by weight.

Lubricant refers to a substance added to the dosage form to enable the tablet granules etc. after it has been compressed to release from the mold or die by reducing friction or wear. Suitable lubricants include metallic stearates such as magnesium stearate calcium stearate or potassium stearate stearic acid high melting point waxes and water soluble lubricants such as sodium chloride sodium benzoate sodium acetate sodium oleate polyethylene glycols and d l leucine. Lubricants are usually added at the very last step before compression since they must be present on the surfaces of the granules and in between them and the parts of the tablet press. The amount of lubricant in the composition can range from about 0.05 to about 15 by weight of the composition preferably 0.2 to about 5 by weight of the composition more preferably from about 0.3 to about 3 and most preferably from about 0.3 to about 1.5 by weight of the composition.

Glidents are materials that prevent caking and improve the flow characteristics of granulations so that flow is smooth and uniform. Suitable glidents include silicon dioxide and talc. The amount of glident in the composition can range from about 0.01 to 10 by weight of the composition preferably 0.1 to about 7 by weight of the total composition more preferably from about 0.2 to 5 by weight and most preferably from about 0.5 to about 2 by weight.

Coloring agents are excipients that provide coloration to the composition or the dosage form. Such excipients can include food grade dyes and food grade dyes adsorbed onto a suitable adsorbent such as clay or aluminum oxide. The amount of the coloring agent can vary from about 0.01 to 10 by weight of the composition preferably from about 0.05 to 6 by weight more preferably from about 0.1 to about 4 by weight of the composition and most preferably from about 0.1 to about 1 .

Peptide s of the invention can be used to form multiparticulates discrete particles well known dosage forms whose totality represents the intended therapeutically useful dose of a drug. When taken orally multiparticulates generally disperse freely in the gastrointestinal tract and maximize absorption. A specific example is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 068 859 disclosing multiparticulates that provide controlled release of azithromycin. Another advantage of the multiparticulates is the improved stability of the drug. The poloxamer component of the multiparticulate is very inert thus minimizing degradation of the drug.

However formulation problems result from the melt congeal process often used to form multiparticulates. The multiparticulates are preferably formed into round beads or spheres. Some carriers when melted and then solidified do not form round beads but may solidify into rods strings or other non spherical shapes. The result is very irregularly shaped multiparticulates that are difficult to process into dosage forms. This problem is solved by e.g. WO 2007104173 where the particles consist of a poloxamer a resin and or a tocopherol creating together with the medicament e.g. insulin micelles. Micelle formation is essential for the absorption of many nutrients within the human body. Bile salts formed in the liver and secreted by the gall bladder allow micelles of fatty acids to form. This allows the absorption of complicated lipids and lipid soluble vitamins within the micelle by the small intestine. Micelles are approximately spherical in shape. Preferably the peptide or the peptide combination of the invention are formulated with a poloxamer and a resin to form micelles suitable for oral administration to patients in need of the medicament.

Liquid form preparations include solutions suspensions and emulsions. As an example may be mentioned water or water propylene glycol solutions for parenteral injections or addition of sweeteners and opacifiers for oral solutions suspensions and emulsions. Liquid form preparations may also include solutions for intranasal administration.

Human A549 cells carcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells were utilized in the experiments employing the Propidium iodide cell cycle assay. The eukaryotic cell cycle is a series of events that take place in a cell leading to its replication.

The regulation of the cell cycle involves steps crucial to the cell including detecting and repairing genetic damage and provision of various checks to prevent uncontrolled cell division. The molecular events that control the cell cycle are ordered and directional that is each process occurs in a sequential fashion.

The cell cycle consists of four distinct phases Gphase S phase Gphase collectively known as interphase and M phase. M phase is itself composed of two tightly coupled processes mitosis in which the cell s chromosomes are divided between the two daughter cells and cytokinesis in which the cell s cytoplasm divides forming distinct cells. Activation of each phase is dependent on the proper progression and completion of the previous one. Cells that have temporarily or reversibly stopped dividing are said to have entered a state of quiescence called Gphase. The relatively brief M phase consists of nuclear division and cytoplasmic division. The first phase within interphase from the end of the previous M phase till the beginning of DNA synthesis is called G G indicating gap or growth . During this phase the biosynthetic activities of the cell resume at a high rate. This phase is marked by synthesis of various enzymes that are required in S phase mainly those needed for DNA replication. The ensuing S phase starts when DNA synthesis commences when it is complete all of the chromosomes have been replicated. The cell then enters the Gphase which lasts until the cell enters mitosis. Significant protein synthesis occurs during this phase mainly involving the production of microtubules which are required during the process of mitosis. Inhibition of protein synthesis during Gphase prevents the cell from undergoing mitosis.

The endothelia were allowed to migrate for 22 hours at 37 C. then migrated cells were fixed and stained with Hoechst 33342 dye. Images of 3 fields per insert were taken and the number of migrated cells per field were quantified using the ImageProPlus software. Data were analyzed for the average number of the migrated cells and standard deviation of six data points for each treatment condition. Active test peptides against HUVEC migration was determined based on 50 inhibition of migrated cells as compared with the control. Statistic p values were computed using the Student s t test.

Results from endothelial cell migration assay Peptide 2 induced by 11 the migration of human endothelial cells peptide 1 inhibited by 3 the migration of human endothelial cells and the peptide combination peptide 1 peptide 2 0.95 mole 1.05 mole did not inhibit the migration of human endothelial cells.

The endothelial tube formation assay is based on the ability of endothelial cells to form three dimensional capillary like tubular structures when cultured on a gel of basement membrane extract. The endothelial tube formation assay represents a powerful model for studying inhibition and induction of angiogenesis. Pre labeled HUVEC with Calcein AM were seeded in a 96 well culture plate coated with extracellular metrix Chemicon international Cat. ECM625 and treated with test peptides 10 micrograms per ml in full growth medium. Positive control was vehicle only. The endothelial cells were allowed to form tubes for 20 hours and were then examined under an inverted fluorescent microscope. Duplicate wells for each treatment were photographed and quantitatively analyzed for an average tubule length using image analysis software ImageProPlus. Raw data were expressed as average tubule lengths in pixels standard deviation. Statistic p values were computed using the Student s t test.

Results from endothelial tube formation assay Peptide 1 inhibited by 9 the tube formation of human endothelial cells peptide 2 inhibited by 20 the tube formation endothelial cells and the peptide combination peptide 1 peptide 2 1.10 mole 0.90 mole did not show any synergistic effect on the inhibition of the tube formation of human endothelial cells.

Adenosine 3 5 cyclic monophosphate cyclic AMP cAMP is one of the most important second messengers involved as a modulator of physiological processes. cAMP is also involved in regulating neuronal glandular cardiovascular immune and other functions and actions in a regulatory way. Fpr being a second messenger cAMP has the following characteristics to work effectively 1 Amplification when a few peptide molecules signal the cell it needs to respond with a signal that is strong enough to get a job done without repeated high levels of stimulation. 2 Control eventually a response must be shut down and there are instances when its necessary to respond a little or a lot so control is needed. 3 Specificity when a peptide is utilized a given cell should respond in a specific way. Not all cells will respond to this peptide and therefore the cannot have the same effect in all the cells. Elevated levels of cAMP in human cells are associated with the suppression of cell activation.

The cAMP kit was used as an immunoassay for the quantitative determination of cyclic AMP generation in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC . PBMC were placed in 96 well microtitier plates 50 microliters of cells at 4 10 ml and 50 microliters of medium alone background control forskolin cAMP positive control 50 micrograms per ml or test peptides 10 micrograms per ml were added. Plates were mixed and incubated for 10 min at 37 C. and the cells were lysed by the addition of 50 microliters of 3 perchloric acid. NaOH was added to neutralize the samples. Plates were centrifuged for 15 min at 2500 rpm and the supernatants removed. The supernatants diluted 2 fold in assay buffer were then assayed for the levels of cAMP by ELISA.

Results from cAMP induction assay Peptides of the invention and the peptide combination had no effects on cAMP formation in human peripheral blood cells.
