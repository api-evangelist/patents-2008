title: Communication system, reliable communication mechanism, and communication method used for the same
abstract: Provided is a communication system capable of fundamentally preventing an attack from an unspecified counterpart and resolve problem even when a problem occurs in a user terminal or client and a server. A mediation server () receives an attack from an outside source on behalf of a server () (server A), redirects and receives communication addressed to a node-representative ID, and performs first authentication for the communication. In the case of a reliable user terminal or client () (client B), the mediation server () provides the device with an intermediary server ID specifying an intermediary server (). The intermediary server () performs second authentication for the user terminal or client () (client B) going through the mediation server (). When it is identified that the user terminal or client () (client B) is reliable, the intermediary server () asks the server () (server A) about an ID and provides the user terminal or client () (client B) with traceable ID information acquired from the server () (server A).

This application is a National Stage of International Application No. PCT JP2008 000484 filed Mar. 7 2008 claiming priority based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2007 058018 filed Mar. 8 2007 the contents of all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The present invention relates to a communication system a reliable communication mechanism and a communication method used for the same and in particular to a communication method for defending against an attack unauthorized access or the like in a communication system including a reliable client and a server.

Recently a dispute has erupted over computer viruses or SPAM mail spyware phishing fraud or one click or two click fraud in Internet communication. In Internet communication a DoS Denial of Service or attack unauthorized access from an unspecified counterpart becomes a threat to a server that transmits information such as contents or the like. Also in public telephone networks or IP Internet Protocol telephone networks phone calls for money transfer fraud SPAM or phishing fraud or the like occur in addition to conventional malicious phone calls or silent phone calls.

For this reason as a function required for a phone or a phone book there is needed a function of denying a response to others except a reliable counterpart that is a function of denying the reception of a malicious call or money transfer fraud call in the case of call reception. To avoid the above described problem a caller number display function is reliable identity verification for a caller as a function in the case of call reception transmission. In the case of call reception there is a method by which an intermediary contact person is allowed to make contact after first receiving a phone call from an unknown counterpart. In the case of call reception transmission there is a method of notifying only reliable partners of a telephone number without loading the telephone number into a public telephone book.

In the designation of the communication destination of transmission the designation is made using information from a local telephone book or a reliable telephone book service. There may be considered a method in which the guidance of an invalid number is provided in the case of call transmission or conversation with the other party is made after connecting a phone call to a secretary instead of oneself upon call transmission. In this regard the caller identity becomes clear in the case of call transmission but there is a problem in that a desired state location privacy for preventing others from learning a calling location is not achieved.

On the other hand as a coping strategy to protect the security of a site even on the Internet there is a strategy using NAT Network Address Translation or a coping strategy at a site border such as DMZ DeMilitarized Zone Firewall or the like. For example this type of coping strategy is disclosed in Patent Document 1 JP A 2004 248185 Patent Document 2 JP A 2004 248198 and Patent Document 3 JP A 2006 050081 .

In this case when an attack has occurred there will be a reaction such as the case where a common user may not be able to access a site. In terms of recovery measure when the attack has occurred recovery is not possible as long as a fundamental measure against the attack is not provided. In terms of access to a site server and a waiting method there is a weakness in that the possibility of undergoing an attack is high since always wait for all counterparts using the same single fixed address.

The conventional communication system described above has a problem in that a site or terminal may not be fundamentally protected from the above described risk of an attack or unauthorized access upon reception global access . When the above described problem has occurred there is another problem in that conventional communication is affected.

In view of the above an object of the present invention is to provide a communication system a reliable communication mechanism and a communication method used for the same which are able to prevent an attack from an unspecified counterpart to a user terminal a client or a server.

According to the present invention there is provided a communication system comprising a mediation server which first receives when access from a user terminal to a server is generated the access on behalf of said server and performs first authentication for the user terminal and an intermediary server which performs second authentication for the user terminal identified as a reliable terminal in said first authentication by said mediation server wherein the access from the user terminal identified as a reliable terminal in said second authentication by said intermediary server is passed to said server.

According to the present invention there is provided a reliable communication mechanism comprising a mediation server which first receives when access from a user terminal to a server is generated the access on behalf of said server and performs first authentication for the user terminal and an intermediary server which performs second authentication for the user terminal identified as a reliable terminal in said first authentication by said mediation server wherein the access from the user terminal identified as a reliable terminal in said second authentication by said intermediary server is passed to said server.

According to the present invention there is provided a communication method comprising first receiving by a mediation server when access from a user terminal to a server is generated the access on behalf of said server and performs first authentication for the user terminal and performing by an intermediary server second authentication for the user terminal identified as a reliable terminal in said first authentication by said mediation server wherein the access from the user terminal identified as a reliable terminal in said second authentication by said intermediary server is passed to said server.

That is the communication system of the present invention may protect the server from an attack by performing authentication by the mediation server moderator for access from the user terminal or client and performing authentication by the intermediary server broker for the user terminal or client identified as reliable by the authentication. In the communication system of the present invention the intermediary server performs authentication for the server as well as authentication for the user terminal or client so that access from the reliable user terminal or client to the reliable server may be realized.

The mediation server is a device disposed to first receive an attack from an outside source on behalf of the server which receives and redirects communication addressed to a node representative ID identification information such as an IP address or the like used to access the server performs the first authentication for the communication for example authentication of a source address or the like and provides a device with intermediary server ID information specifying the intermediary server when the terminal issuing an access request is identified as the reliable user terminal or client. In this case the mediation server notifies the intermediary server of the fact that access to the node representative ID exists.

The intermediary server performs the second authentication for the user terminal or client going through authentication by the mediation server for example authentication of whether a signal is received from a specific site . In this case the intermediary server performs authentication for the user terminal or client authentication for the server and other security checks by authenticating a physical line or a subscriber line between the user terminal or client and the server.

The intermediary server receives a request from the user terminal or client asks the server about ID information and provides the user terminal or client with traceable ID Traceable Private ID information acquired from the server. A security gateway of the server side verifies access to the server by a traceable ID. The traceable ID may be a fixed IP address or a dynamic IP address and may be corresponded to the user terminal or client accessing the server thereby specifying a transmission source only by a destination address.

As such in the communication system of the present invention the mediation server receives and redirects or blocks communication addressed to a node representative ID and the intermediary server intermediates a trust relationship to provide only reliable counterparts with traceable ID information thereby fundamentally preventing an attack from an unspecified counterpart without dealing with a problem after the problem occurs in the client or server.

The communication system of the present invention may fundamentally solve the above problem by replacing the mediation server with a mediation server having another node representative ID even when a DoS Denial of Service attack for the server occurs.

 b reception transmission a traceable ID is used a transmission source may be specified only by a destination address 

 c reception communication addressed to the node representative ID is received redirected or blocked by the mediation server 

 d transmission reception a reliable community to collect information is formed by the intermediary server 

 e transmission traceable ID information is provided only to reliable counterparts using a reliable communication mechanism through the intermediary server 

 g transmission proxy resolving of a traceable ID is connected by a security gateway of a local site and

 h transmission a local area is protected by a node representative ID and a counterpart is specified by a traceable ID.

According to the above described configuration and operation the present invention may fundamentally prevent an attack from an unspecified counterpart to a user terminal client or server.

The mediation server is a device which first receives an attack from an unreliable client client X on behalf of the server server A and includes a source address check unit and an intermediary server ID holding unit .

When communication to address information NID IP retrieved and obtained that is resolved by the DNS server on the basis of NID FQDN Fully Qualified Domain Name as a node representative ID is received the mediation server redirects the communication and first authenticates the communication by the source address check unit . When a terminal issuing an access request is identified as a reliable user terminal the mediation server provides the user terminal with intermediary server ID information of the intermediary server ID holding unit and notifies the intermediary server of the fact that access to the node representative ID exists.

For example the source address check unit checks a source address of communication to the address information NID IP a connection for the communication is denied when the source address is out of a given address range set in advance and the intermediary server ID information of the intermediary server ID holding unit is provided when the source address is in the given address range. As the first authentication an identification method other than the source address check method is applicable.

Here the node representative ID is an ID to be used to access the server server A which is permanent information NID FQDN in published information and is corresponded to the address information NID IP that is an address differing according to differing of the mediation server and managed by the DNS server . The intermediary server ID is an ID indicating a position where a traceable ID is acquired. The traceable ID is an ID that is a fixed address or dynamic address assigned to each communication counterpart and may be received from the intermediary server through a secure path.

The intermediary server is a device that performs the second authentication for the client client B authenticated by the mediation server or the unreliable client client X and includes the security check unit and the traceable ID intermediary unit . The second identity check by the security check unit for example the authentication or security check for the server server A and the client client B may be performed by authenticating whether a subscriber line of the server server A and the client client B is a reliable path a communication path of which security is identified or whether the server server A and the client client B belong to the reliable sites and . Whether the subscriber line is the reliable path may be checked on the basis of a switching center accommodating the subscriber line from the server server A and the client client B .

The intermediary server receives a request of the client client B by the traceable ID intermediary unit asks the server server A about a traceable ID and provides the client client B with traceable ID information acquired from the server server A . When the security for the above described unreliable client client X has been checked the intermediary server determines that the client does not belong to the reliable sites and thereby denying the access from the client .

The security gateway security gateway A is a device that verifies access to the server server A through the reliable path established with the intermediary server using the traceable ID and includes the security gateway and the traceable ID managing server . The security gateways and security gateways A and B close a path other than a reliable path established with the intermediary server for example a VPN Virtual Private Network by a tunnel in the IPsec IP security protocol or a dedicated line.

The client client B starts communication step a of and outputs node representative ID NID FQDN to the DNS server to retrieve address information NID IP steps a and a of . The DNS server resolves an address on the basis of node representative ID NID FQDN step a of and sends the address information NID IP as a result of the address resolving to the client client B step a of . The client client B transmits a connection request to the mediation server through the security gateway security gateway B on the basis of the address information NID IP acquired from the DNS server steps a and a of .

The mediation server checks a source address for the connection request from the client client B step a of and reports an intermediary server ID of the intermediary server ID holding unit to the client client B when the check is OK steps a and a of . At this time the mediation server notifies the intermediary server of the fact that access from the client client B exists step all of .

The client client B receives the intermediary server ID from the mediation server through the security gateway security gateway B and sends the connection request to the intermediary server through the security gateway security gateway B step a of when the intermediary server ID is input step a of .

When the connection request is received from the client client B the intermediary server performs the security check of whether each of the server server A and the client client B is connected by a reliable path or belongs to the reliable sites and step a of . When each of the server server A and the client client B is connected by the reliable path or belongs to the reliable sites and the intermediary server notifies the security gateway of the fact that the connection request from the secure client client B exists steps a and a of .

When the notification of the connection request from the client client B is received the security gateway sends the notification to the server server A step all of . When the request notification is received from the security gateway the server server A instructs the traceable ID managing server to generate the traceable ID steps a and a of . When the ID generation instruction is received from the server server A the traceable ID managing server generates or reads the traceable ID step a of and issues the traceable ID to the client client B steps a and a of . At this time the traceable ID managing server issues the traceable ID to the server server A step a of .

The client client B receives a traceable ID from the traceable ID managing server through the intermediary server and the security gateways and security gateways A and B and outputs the traceable ID steps a and a of and is connected by the server server A steps a and a of .

At this time the security gateway of the security gateway security gateway A verifies the access to the server server A through the reliable path established with the intermediary server using the traceable ID step a of . Thereafter the client client B starts web page browsing step a of and acquires and displays data by accessing the server server A steps a and a of . The process of steps a to a described above is that in an administration domain Admin Domain which is not shown to the client client B .

When the unreliable client client X performs unauthorized access or a DoS attack to the server server A on the basis of leaked address information NID IP or address information NID IP obtained by resolving an address of a node representative ID NID FQDN steps b b and b of the mediation server checks a source address added to a connection request from the client client X step b of a communication connection is denied when the source address is out of a given address range set in advance steps b and b of . Thereby in this embodiment the mediation server may defend against the unauthorized access or DoS attack from the client client X .

When the unreliable client client X performs the unauthorized access or DoS attack to the server server A on the basis of leaked address information NID IP or address information NID IP obtained by resolving an address of a node representative ID NID FQDN steps c c and c of the mediation server checks a source address added to a connection request from the client client X step c of and provides the client client X with the intermediary server ID information of the intermediary server ID holding unit when the source address is in the given address range set in advance steps c and c of . At this time the mediation server notifies the intermediary server of the fact that access from the client client X exists step c of .

The client client X receives an intermediary server ID from the mediation server and sends a connection request to the intermediary server step c of when the intermediary server ID is input step c of . When the connection request is received from the client client X the intermediary server performs the security check of whether each of the server server A and the client client X is connected by a reliable path or belongs to the reliable sites and step c of .

When the client client X is not connected by the reliable path or does not belong to the reliable sites and the intermediary server denies access from the client client X steps c and c of .

The client client B starts communication step d of and outputs node representative ID NID FQDN to the DNS server so as to retrieve the address information NID IP steps d and d of . The DNS server resolves an address on the basis of node representative ID NID FQDN step d of . When the address information NID IP corresponding to the node representative ID NID FQDN does not exist as the address resolving result step d of and the DNS process is timed out step d of the DNS server transmits an IP address obtained by executing a conventional DNS process to the client client B step d of . The client client B outputs the IP address obtained from the DNS server step d of 

As such in this embodiment the reliable communication mechanism prevents a threat of a global access environment and performs the ID management of the network layer for example name resolving or ID generation issuance expiration and the mediation server receives unauthorized access or a DoS attack from a malicious user terminal that is the unreliable client client X on behalf of the server server A so that communication with only reliable counterpart devices that is the server server A and the client client B may be realized.

Thereby in this embodiment since the mediation server receives communication from the client client B or the malicious user terminal that is the unreliable client client X on behalf of the server server A both problems of a threat to the site and privacy leakage may be solved before arrival at the server server A without conventionally performing reception at a border of the site .

In terms of a specific service for preventing the threat of this case the reliable intermediary server is responsible for a service of a carrier the mediation server proxy device is responsible for a service of an xSP x Service Provider and the security gateways and security gateways A and B are responsible for a service of an edge site.

In this embodiment since the mediation server and the intermediary server receive an attack before the attack reaches the local site without conventionally defending against the attack using Firewall or NAT Network Address Translation of the local site the local site is not directly affected even though the attack is made.

As such this embodiment may realize the reliable communication architecture organizing a trust relationship without changing an AP application after protecting privacy information by an IP Internet Protocol layer. As a method of preventing an attack from an outside source in this reliable communication architecture the attack is defended by the mediation server and the intermediary server before the attack from the outside source reaches the local site .

In terms of the influence on the local site when the attack has been made in the reliable communication architecture the local site is not affected since the attack occurs in a place away from the local site . As recovery measure when the attack has occurred in the reliable communication architecture recovery may be easily performed when the mediation server is stopped unused and a service may be continued by another mediation server. The above described mediation server or the other mediation server may be installed in a place for example a different city or town or a different country away from the server server A .

As a method of awaiting access to the server server A in the reliable communication architecture a fixed address or a plurality of dynamic addresses is used which differs according to a counterpart and access waits only when the access is predicted in the server server A when the presence of access from the intermediary server is reported . In this case privacy information of the local site or the server server A that is information indicating Location Privacy inner site information indicating where the local site or the server is located is not leaked to an unspecified external counterpart.

That is in this embodiment the intermediary server may perform authentication for the server server A as well as authentication for the client client B or the malicious user terminal that is the unreliable client client X . In this embodiment a service by the mediation server is like a hosting service realized in a state in which a main body of the server server A is placed at home.

Here private or unpublished address information in a DNS API DNS Application Programming Interface is registered to a database not shown of a DNS to be managed by the distributed DB server . The DNS server wrapper is realized by a program group which controls access on the basis of the address information.

The first embodiment of the present invention described above uses an HTTP Hyper Text Transfer Protocol framework and is effective in communication using a web browser application. On the other hand this embodiment uses a DNS framework and an application in communication using IP Internet Protocol is not limited.

The DNS server receives a request of the client client B and provides acquired traceable ID information for this client. In this case the DNS server retrieves address information NID IP resolves an address of a node representative ID on the basis of node representative ID NID FQDN received from the client client B and acquires intermediary server ID information for the client from the mediation server as a place where the retrieved address information NID IP is received. The DNS server acquires traceable ID information for the client from the intermediary server of the acquired intermediary server ID address. When address information NID IP corresponding to the node representative ID NID FQDN does not exist the DNS server executes a conventional DNS process.

The mediation server receives communication to address information NID IP from the DNS server and provides the DNS server with intermediary server ID information for the client. When a request from the DNS server is received the intermediary server notifies the server server A of the request through the security gateway and provides the DNS server with traceable ID information for the client generated from the traceable ID managing server by an instruction from the server server A . The security gateway verifies access to the server server A by the traceable ID and the traceable ID managing server generates or reads the traceable ID by an instruction from the server server A and sends a response to the intermediary server .

In this embodiment when the client client B accesses the DNS server so as to access the server server A the DNS server first resolves an address of a node representative ID accesses the mediation server on the basis of an address resolving result acquires an intermediary server ID accesses the intermediary server by the acquired intermediary server ID to acquire a traceable ID and notifies the client client B of the traceable ID. On the other hand the unreliable client client X does not have access by the check in the mediation server or the intermediary server as in the first embodiment of the present invention described above.

The client client B starts communication step e of and outputs node representative ID NID FQDN to the DNS server so as to retrieve the address information NID IP steps e and e of . The DNS server resolves an address on the basis of node representative ID NID FQDN step e of and acquires address information MID IP by sending node representative ID NID FQDN to the distributed DB server steps e and e of . The DNS server transmits a connection request to the mediation server on the basis of the acquired address information MID IP steps e and e of .

The mediation server checks a source address of the client client B in response to the connection request of the DNS server step e of and notifies the DNS server of an intermediary server ID of the intermediary server ID holding unit when the check is OK steps e and ell of . At this time the mediation server notifies the intermediary server of the fact that access from the client client B exists step e of .

When an intermediary server ID is received from the mediation server the DNS server sends the connection request to the intermediary server on the basis of the intermediary server ID step e of . When the connection request is received from the DNS server the intermediary server performs the security check of whether each of the server server A and the client client B is connected by a reliable path or belongs to the reliable sites and step e of .

When each of the server server A and the client client B is connected by the reliable path or belongs to the reliable sites and the intermediary server notifies the security gateway of the connection request from the secure client client B steps e and e of .

When the notification of the connection request from the client client B is received the security gateway sends the notification to the server server A step ell of . When the request notification is received from the security gateway the server server A instructs the traceable ID managing server to generate a traceable ID steps e and e of .

When the ID generation instruction is received from the server server A the traceable ID managing server generates or reads the traceable ID NID IP step e of and issues the traceable ID NID IP to the DNS server through the intermediary server steps e e and e of . At this time the traceable ID managing server also issues the traceable ID NID IP to the server server A step e of .

The DNS server transmits the traceable ID NID IP received through the intermediary server to the client client B step e of . The client client B receives the traceable ID NID IP from the DNS server through the security gateway security gateway B and outputs the traceable ID NID IP step e of and is connected by the server server A steps e and e of .

At this time the security gateway of the security gateway security gateway A verifies the access to the server server A through a reliable path established with the intermediary server by the traceable ID NID IP step e of . Thereafter the client client B starts web page browsing step a of and acquires and displays data by accessing the server server A steps e and e of . The process of steps e to e described above is that in an administration domain Admin Domain which is not shown to the client client B .

As such this embodiment may also achieve the same effect as the first embodiment of the present invention except that the DNS server within the same site as that of the client client B acquires a traceable ID NID IP using the DNS framework and provides the client client B with the traceable ID NID IP . That is in this embodiment the reliable communication mechanism prevents the threat of a global access environment and performs the ID management of the network layer for example name resolving or ID generation issuance expiration and the mediation server receives unauthorized access or a DoS attack from a malicious user terminal that is the unreliable client client X on behalf of the server server A so that communication only with reliable counterpart devices may be realized.

In this embodiment information accumulated in a database to be managed by the distributed DB server retrieved by the DNS server within the same site as that of the client client B is set to be private that is unpublished thereby contributing to retention of users.

The client client B starts communication step f of and outputs node representative ID NID FQDN to the DNS server so as to retrieve the address information NID IP steps f and f of . The DNS server resolves an address on the basis of node representative ID NID FQDN step f of and acquires address information MID IP by sending node representative ID NID FQDN to the distributed DB server steps f and f of . The DNS server transmits a connection request to the mediation server on the basis of the acquired address information MID IP steps f and f of .

When the connection request notification is received from the mediation server the intermediary server performs the security check of whether each of the server server A and the client client B is connected by a reliable path or belongs to the reliable sites and step f of 

When each of the server server A and the client client B is connected by the reliable path or belongs to the reliable sites and the intermediary server notifies the security gateway of the connection request from the secure client client B steps f and f of .

When the notification of the connection request from the client client B is received the security gateway sends the notification to the server server A step f of . When the request notification is received from the security gateway the server server A instructs the traceable ID managing server to generate a traceable ID steps f and f of .

When the ID generation instruction is received from the server server A the traceable ID managing server generates or reads the traceable ID NID IP step f of and issues the traceable ID NID IP to the mediation server through the intermediary server steps f f and f of . At this time the traceable ID managing server also issues the traceable ID NID IP to the server server A step f of .

The mediation server transmits the traceable ID NID IP received through the intermediary server to the client client B through the DNS server steps f and f of . The client client B receives the traceable ID NID IP from the DNS server through the security gateway security gateway B and outputs the traceable ID NID IP step f of and is connected by the server server A steps f and f of .

At this time the security gateway of the security gateway security gateway A verifies the access to the server server A through a reliable path established with the intermediary server by the traceable ID NID IP step f of . Thereafter the client client B starts web page browsing step f of and acquires and displays data by accessing the server server A steps f and f of . The process of steps f to f described above is that in an administration domain Admin Domain which is not shown to the client client B .
