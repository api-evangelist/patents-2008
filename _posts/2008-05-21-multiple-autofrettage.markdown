This application claims the benefit under 35 USC 119 e of U.S. provisional patent application No. 60 939 671 filed on May 23 2007 which application is hereby incorporated by reference.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to manufacturing methods and in particular to manufacturing methods for enhancing residual stresses. The following non patent literature is referred to in the specification and is expressly incorporated by reference herein 

Prior to normal use many engineering components and structures are subjected to overloads in excess of their design operating level. Examples of such overloads are shakedown of a bridge structure hydraulic or swage autofrettage of a pressure vessel including gun barrels and mandrel enlargement of rivet holes including aircraft structures .

In general the purpose of such overloads is to cause the stresses within the material s to behave in an inelastic fashion at design critical locations and thereby on removal of initial overload to induce advantageous residual stresses at or near the critical locations. These residual stresses subsequently serve to mitigate the stresses due to normal operation and thereby improve fatigue lifetime and or improve fracture resistance and or inhibit re yielding. For example in the case of a typical pressure vessel the use of autofrettage can increase the fatigue lifetime of a tube with pre existing crack like defects by approximately one order of magnitude.

Many materials exhibit the Bauschinger effect 1 2 . The Bauschinger effect serves to reduce the yield strength in compression as a result of prior tensile plastic overload or vice versa when compression precedes tension . It is often assumed that the Bauschinger effect is associated with the pile up of microscopic dislocations at grain boundaries and the associated creation of microscopic zones of residual stress 3 . The reduction of yield strength after load reversal is of importance because on removal of the overload critical regions experience high values of reversed stress. This may approach the magnitude of the yield strength if the unloading is totally elastic. If because of the Bauschinger effect the combination of stresses exceeds some yield criterion the component or structure will re yield thus losing much of the potential benefit of overloading.

The loss of residual compressive hoop stress has been quantified for the case of hydraulically autofrettaged open end tubes 4 . Such tubes are overloaded during an autofrettage process involving extremely high bore pressures applied to the length of the tube this is usually termed hydraulic autofrettage . The ratio of the wall thickness which behaves plastically during autofrettage to the total wall thickness is termed the overstrain . As a rule of thumb for typical diameter ratios and overstrain levels ideal residual compressive hoop stress at the bore is reduced by 30 by Bauschinger effect and associated effects. As a result the fatigue lifetime of a typical tubular steel pressure vessel subjected to 80 overstrain which does not exhibit Bauschinger effect may be more than one order of magnitude greater than the same pressure vessel which does exhibit Bauschinger effect. Hence if it were possible to eliminate the deleterious impact of the Bauschinger effect the lifetime of the component would be very significantly increased.

It is an object of the invention to provide a method for enhancing the residual stresses in a structure.

It is another object of the invention to provide a method of improving one or more of the fatigue lifetime fracture resistance and re yield resistance of a structure.

One aspect of the invention is a method comprising a first step of performing swage autofrettage on an object a second step of heat soaking the object and a third step of performing hydraulic autofrettage on the object. The method may further comprise repeating the second and third steps. The method may additionally comprise a fourth step of heat soaking the object.

In one embodiment the method may comprise adding material to the object and or removing material from the object after the first third or fourth step. In some embodiments the heat soaking step or steps may be restricted to a critical area of the object.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

An alternative to hydraulic autofrettage is swage autofrettage in which a relatively short mandrel is forced along the inside of the tube. This produces localized yielding near the mandrel. A residual stress solution for the case of swage autofrettage assuming ideal elastic perfectly plastic behavior without Bauschinger effect is reported by O Hara 5 . The results presented in 5 were later adjusted to incorporate Bauschinger effect 6 . Subsequently work by Underwood et al 7 quantified experimentally some residual stress fields due to swage autofrettage.

In some overload procedures such as autofrettage it has been common practice following overload to heat soak all or part of the structure by way of a slowly applied heating and cooling process in order to stabilize the material. It is often assumed that heat soak produces a healing effect at the microscopic level such that dislocation pile ups caused by the overload are very significantly dissipated or removed.

There has been examination of a double overload procedure wherein the structure is overloaded once and then without any intervening process is subjected to a second similar overload. Apart from a modest contribution due to further strain hardening and or ratcheting of the material such a process produces little or no benefit 8 .

The heat soak causes microscopic dislocations to be reduced or eliminated while retaining macroscopic residual stresses due to the previous overload. Hence the material responds effectively as virgin material containing a pre existing residual stress field when the next overload is applied. Plastic strains and hence Bauschinger effect during subsequent re overloads are thereby dramatically reduced. This behavior is analogous to autofrettage of pre shrunk tubes wherein there has been no prior plastic deformation 10 . Residual stresses created by such a sequence are illustrated in taken from 9 .

The above procedure is distinctly different from hydraulic autofrettage followed by heat soak and further hydraulic re autofrettage.

A specific embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of an example with reference to the accompanying and Table 1. Values of stresses presented within are based upon a standard numerical stress analysis procedure 4 which permits the incorporation of pre existing residual stress fields from prior loading sequences 9 .

A sequence of equivalent numerical analyses each at a different re autofrettage pressure gives the discrete pressure and stress values shown in . incorporates a correction for the ring cutting process. In RYP indicates re yield pressure the pressure at which re yielding commences. SMP indicates safe maximum pressure defined as the pressure that creates an additional permanent 0.01 circumferential strain at the outside diameter following its removal. Bore Hoop is the residual compressive hoop stress at the bore. OD hoop is the outside diameter hoop stress. The values are tabulated in Table 1.

Calculations based on Paris fatigue crack growth law 11 using data from Table 1 show that the fatigue lifetime of such a tube cycled with fixed internal pressure would be increased as a result of such a procedure. The proportionate increase in fatigue lifetime for a range of re autofrettage pressures is shown in . The plot shows life improvement ratio i.e. lifetime after re autofrettage and associated heat soaks divided by lifetime after single swage autofrettage . Thus for example when the operating cyclic pressure is 550 MPa prior hydraulic re autofrettage to 750 MPa increases life by a factor of 1.55.

There are two sets of experimental data that may be compared with the numerical model employed herein. The first is an extensive set of tests conducted by Audino et al 12 that relate to SMP testing of tubes following initial autofrettage. In this set three separate swage autofrettaged A723 steel gun tubes were tested. The three tubes had the dimensions analyzed herein and yield strengths of 1022 1105 and 1177 MPa respectively. Strain gauges were attached to the OD of each tube and zeroed. The tube was then pressurized and completely depressurized after which permanent OD strain was noted. The procedure was repeated with increasing maximum pressure until a permanent OD strain of 0.1 was attained.

The second set of tests is due to Troiano et al. 13 and relates to SMP testing of tubes following initial swage autofrettage and subsequent low temperature heat treatment and hydraulic re autofrettage. Two A723 tubes were tested. The first tube with yield strength 1055 MPa was hydraulically re autofrettaged to a pressure of 710 MPa. The second tube with yield strength 1130 MPa was hydraulically re autofrettaged to a pressure of 731 MPa. Each tube was then subjected to an SMP type test as described above until permanent OD strain reached approximately 0.025 . shows the experimental results denoted by the two right hand sets of cross like symbols.

The pressures achieved during SMP testing of the re autofrettaged tubes i.e. the cross like symbols actually exceed those predicted via a numerical analysis that assumes little or no retained strain hardening. The explanation of these significantly higher experimental pressures is likely associated with the retention and increase of strain hardening throughout the various processes.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
