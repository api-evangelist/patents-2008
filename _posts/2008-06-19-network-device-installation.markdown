Installing an Internet gateway device or other type of network device can be a difficult process since there may be several scenarios in how the network is connected and since there are many devices that may or may not already be installed at the network.

As an example a user may want to upgrade a home network by adding a new type of a network device such as a new router. Alternatively a user may want to upgrade from a traditional router to a wireless router. In such situations it would be useful to have knowledge and access to the settings of the old device during installation of the new or upgraded device. Further with the variety of devices sold by different vendors and with different versions of devices offered by the same vendor the device settings from the old device may not be suitable for or may need to be manually converted to proper configurations for the new network device.

In a particular embodiment a method of processing device settings of a network device is disclosed. The method of processing device settings includes requesting a network device to provide device settings and storing the device settings in a device independent format. Device settings include computer network settings such as local area network settings and wide area network settings. After the device settings have been stored in the device independent format the device settings may be subsequently retrieved and used for replacement of the network device in a computer network. In a particular embodiment the device settings are stored in the device independent format in a second device such as at a server or a personal computer.

In another particular embodiment a network device replacement method is disclosed. The network device replacement method includes identifying a replacement device querying the replacement device to determine whether the replacement device is compatible with configuration data in a device independent format and communicating the configuration data in the device independent format to the replacement device to facilitate installation of the replacement device in a computer network.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Referring to a particular embodiment of a system to retrieve network device configuration data to support replacement of the network device within a computer network is illustrated. The system includes a representative installed network device such as the illustrated router a computer and a server of a service provider . The installed network device is coupled to the server of the service provider via a modem and a computer network . In a particular embodiment the computer network is the public Internet. The installed network device is intended to be replaced by a replacement router . The installed network device is a network device that includes device and network settings . The installed network device is coupled to other network devices installed in the network such as a first illustrative device and a second illustrative device in a network. Each of the first and second devices include a respective set of device settings and . The installed network device is coupled for communication with the computer as illustrated. The device and network settings of the installed network device include configuration data such as wide area network WAN configuration data and local area network LAN configuration data . The device and network settings further include security information such as a user name and password.

The computer includes a processor and a computer memory . The computer memory includes processor executable instructions . In addition the computer memory includes a memory area configured to store universal device configuration UDC format data that may include device independent network configuration data derived from exported data received from the installed router . The computer is coupled to a display device and may be coupled to a user interface such that the computer may be controlled and used by an end user. An example of a suitable computer interface is a keyboard and a computer mouse interface.

During operation the computer sends a universal device configuration UDC request to the installed network device . In response to receiving the UDC request the installed network device retrieves configuration data including the WAN configuration data and the LAN configuration data . The installed network device may also include device settings data retrieved from external devices such as the device settings data and the device settings data from the first and second devices and as shown in . An example of device settings includes Internet configurations LAN network settings and firewall or parental control settings. Wireless settings may also be included if the user is replacing a wireless router device. The installed network device in response to the UDC request provides exported data including the retrieved configuration data and sends the exported data to the computer . The computer in response to receiving the exported data converts the exported data into a device independent format such as the UDC format and stores the received exported data in the UDC format in the computer memory as shown at .

The exported data is also communicated via the modem and via the network to the server of the service provider . The server of the service provider also has the ability to store the converted UDC format data as shown. In addition the server of the service provider may send a separate independent request for UDC data UDC request and in response to the UDC request the installed router provides the exported data to the server of the service provider .

Since the device configuration data is stored in a device independent format e.g. the UDC format data the computer or the server of the service provider may use the stored device configuration data for convenient and automated support during installation of a new network device such as during installation of the replacement router to replace the original installed network device as shown in . As such the device settings of network devices including wide area network settings and local area network settings may be stored in a device independent format in a device other than the installed network device . For example the device settings may be stored in a second device such as the computer or the server of the service provider . In a particular embodiment the device settings include static data. In another embodiment the device settings include device specific information such as audio codecs video codecs frame data rates resolution information or Digital Living Network Alliance DLNA support information. Some aspects of the UDC data file are generic and can apply to all devices while other aspects of the UDC data file are device specific router network attached storage NAS etc. similar to device specific files for device profile for web services DPWS . The UDC data file can be stored locally on the computer or at an online service portal such as at the server of the service provider .

Remote storage is useful if the device being replaced may be damaged and is not available to export settings or if the UDC data file is not located on the computer . Portal storage at the server of the service provider can also be used as a mechanism to perform standard installations. For example an Internet service provider ISP or other service provider may host standard configuration files on the portal for devices that they support to provide for a uniform configuration during installations. In a particular embodiment the device independent data in the UDC format may be used to support provisioning and registration of a second network device e.g. a new or upgraded device prior to adding the second network device such as the replacement router to the computer network. In a particular embodiment the network device and the replacement device may be different types of network devices other than the router shown. For example the network device and the replacement device may be a printer a camera a digital picture frame a digital media player a network attached storage device a computer a smart telephone or other similar device that may be attached to or utilized by a computer network. The replacement network device such as the replacement router may include logic or processor instructions that are compatible with receiving configuration data in the device independent format e.g. the UDC format data . In an alternative embodiment the replacement network device does not include logic or other functionality compatible with the UDC format. In this case the replacement device may include a device driver or may support an alternate protocol that may be used to translate or transfer the configuration data onto the replacement device to support installation of the replacement device within the computer network.

In a particular embodiment a computer readable media may include a set of computer program instructions that may be executed to cause a machine such as a processor within the computer to execute the methods of operation as described herein. For example the computer readable media may include program instructions that cause the processor of the computer to perform operations such as to request the installed network device to provide device settings such as LAN and WAN network settings data and to store the device settings in a device independent format. In addition the computer may identify a replacement device for the network device . An example of a replacement device is the replacement router as shown in . The disclosed system and method provide a process of exporting settings from an old network device and guide a user through physical configuration of a replacement device. The disclosed system and method provide for importing old settings into a new network device upgrading the new network device and guiding the user through additional configuration settings and options to facilitate fast and easy network device replacement.

Referring to a system used to facilitate installation of a replacement network device by remotely storing device independent configuration data is illustrated. The system includes a server of the service provider coupled to a computer device having a browser . The server of the service provider includes a hosted user application programming interface API and includes UDC format data . The server of the service provider is coupled via a computer network such as the Internet to a remote home or office network . The remote network includes an illustrative network device such as a router coupled to an electronic device and coupled to a representative personal computer PC . The personal computer is coupled to a display device and interacts with the electronic device via an electronic of the service provider device application programming interface API .

During operation a user of any computer having a browser such as the illustrated computer device may communicate with a remote network via a hosted API of the server of the service provider . The server of the service provider also stores device settings of one or more network devices in a universal device configuration UDC format . The user of the computer device may remotely access and utilize the UDC data as well as the user interface API to remotely configure settings of network devices within the home or office . For example the user of the computer device may selectively access and control settings of the electronic device coupled to the home or office network .

Referring to a method of processing device settings of a network device is shown. The method includes exporting settings from a currently installed network device such as a router or similar network device at . The method further includes a connection step to guide a user through the process of making physical connections to install a replacement network device as shown at . The connectivity process uses customized images to correctly show the product and connection ports of the product to the end user so that the user understands how to perform physical connections and installation. During this process other physical attributes of the product may be adjusted to improve the performance of the network device. The connectivity process using the customized images may be implemented by use of an installation wizard program. The installation wizard program may discover a new network device using discovery methods such as UPNP LLTD or WS discovery to locate the new network device. The method further includes importing old settings that were previously stored from the installed device into the replacement network device that is to be installed into the computer network as shown at .

The method further includes updating the replacement network device with new firmware if available or needed at . During this step the device communicates with the service portal to check for updates. This step is optional where an installation wizard on a setup CD is used for configuration and provides the update functionality. The update process supports devices that require a reset to default to upgrade to a latest image file. In this case the installation wizard is downloaded locally exports the latest UDC file upgrades the network device and allows the network device to reset defaults prior to importing the UDC data back into the network device. Where the user attempts to perform this process from a wireless connection the installation wizard reconfigures the personal computer to connect to the default settings of the network device and then reconnects the new settings once imported.

The replacement device is set up by configuring additional settings and beginning a network transfer or setup process as shown at . Once the replacement device has been installed with the latest updates the setup or provisioning process guides the user through setting up a new network or adding a device to an existing network. The setup provisioning accommodates devices that need to be configured differently based on user preferences. Since many users may not know what operations they intend to perform the setup provisioning step assists the user with determining their use cases and in configuring home network components as applicable. The setup and configuration process further includes provisioning the replacement network device at registering the replacement network device at and creating and or joining the network with respect to the replacement device as shown at . The provisioning process is used to confirm device connectivity to local Internet based home network services. Registration is used to link the network device to a user identification of the particular user who is responsible for the home network. The create join network process is used to guide the user in a first time setup of a home network by defining elements that are to be used by the particular user. The join network option may be used when another device is to be added to an existing network such as when adding network attached storage NAS .

Referring to further details of the method of replacing a network device with respect to the importation operation illustrated in are shown. The method of performing the importation operation includes a discovery phase . The discovery phase is to locate the replacement network device once there has been a physical connection of the replacement network device to the personal computer. The method of importation further includes a validation phase to verify that the replacement network device can accept a device independent configuration settings file e.g. universal device configuration UDC format data as shown at . The method further includes a review phase to compare the UDC settings to available device setting options at the replacement network device at and to import the UDC data file to the replacement network device that is to replace the previously installed device as shown at .

Referring to a method of processing device settings to facilitate replacement of a network device is shown. The method includes requesting a device installed in a computer network to provide device settings at . In a particular embodiment the device settings may include LAN settings WAN settings or other settings of one or more computer network devices attached to the computer network for use in configuration of a replacement network device such as a replacement router. The method further includes storing the device settings in a device independent format such as the UDC format at . After storing the device settings in the device independent format the method includes identifying a replacement network device to replace the installed network device in the computer network at . The method further includes displaying images to guide a user through a process of making physical connections of the replacement network device to the computer network at .

In addition the method includes importing the device settings in the device independent format to the replacement device updating the replacement device with available firmware or software and configuring additional settings for the replacement network device as shown at . The method of network device replacement further includes to provision the replacement network device and to register the replacement network device prior to adding the replacement network device to the computer network at . Further the method includes adding the replacement network device to the computer network as shown at . In a particular embodiment the provisioning and registering of the second device i.e. the replacement network device occurs prior to adding the second device to the computer network.

Referring to another particular embodiment of a method of network device replacement is illustrated. The method includes identifying a replacement device for a device installed in a computer network at . The method further includes querying the replacement device to determine whether the replacement device is compatible with receiving configuration data in a device independent format at . In a particular embodiment the device independent data format is in the UDC data format and the replacement device is queried to determine whether the replacement device can receive and process the UDC format data.

The method further includes determining whether the replacement device is compatible with data in the device independent format at . If the replacement device is compatible with data in the device independent format the method proceeds to communicate the configuration data in the device independent format to the replacement device as shown at . If the replacement device is not compatible with data in the device independent format at the method proceeds to where the data is translated or transferred onto the replacement device using a device driver or using an alternate protocol for transferring the device independent data to the replacement device.

In a particular embodiment the replacement device is a replacement for an Internet gateway device that was previously installed in a computer network. Also in a particular embodiment the universal device configuration data is retrieved by use of a vendor provided device communication driver for the device that is to be replaced. The universal device configuration data may be retrieved by use of an HTML driver to download a configuration file from a user device of the device to be replaced. The HTML driver may automatically log in to a web based user interface to collect the device settings from the device to be replaced.

In another embodiment a web crawler application is executed to access the web server interface to automatically create the HTML driver for use in device replacement. The use of a web crawler application to automatically go through the web user interface and to automatically create the HTML driver eliminates the need for custom drivers since the application may be launched based on a location of the network device e.g. IP address and type of management information to be used e.g. user name and password . Once the location and management information is provided the web crawler application may scan available pages in the network device recording options and settings for replacement installation.

The disclosed system and method include technologies to address device discovery and secure device configuration and control relating to home network applications. A discovery protocol for device discovery may operate at layer two to discover devices that do not have an IP address using options such as LLTD or WS discovery. The configuration and control protocol used to provide a direct and secure link to the device from the Internet and from the local area network side of the device may be implemented using web services functionality. As such the disclosed system provides communication and ease of installation with respect to both sides of the network device i.e. from the WAN side and from the LAN side .
