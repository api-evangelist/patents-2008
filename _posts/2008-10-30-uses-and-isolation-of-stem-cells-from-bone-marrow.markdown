This application is also a continuation in part of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 096 754 filed Jun. 9 2008 which is a National Phase of International Application No. PCT US2006 042780 filed Nov. 2 2006 which claims the benefit of U.S. provisional Application No. 60 748 685 filed Dec. 8 2005. The contents of all of the above identified applications are hereby incorporated by reference.

This invention was made with Government support under Grant Nos. R01 HL072410 HL 055757 HL 068088 and HL 070897 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The Government has certain rights to this invention.

The presently disclosed subject matter relates in general to the identification isolation and use of a population of stem cells isolated from bone marrow umbilical cord blood and or other sources and that are referred to herein as very small embryonic like VSEL stem cells. More particularly the presently disclosed subject matter relates to isolating said VSEL stem cells and employing the same optionally after in vitro manipulation to treat tissue and or organ damage in a subject in need thereof.

The use of stem cells and stem cell derivatives has gained increased interest in medical research particularly in the area of providing reagents for treating tissue damage either as a result of genetic defects injuries and or disease processes. Ideally cells that are capable of differentiating into the affected cell types could be transplanted into a subject in need thereof where they would interact with the organ microenvironment and supply the necessary cell types to repair the injury.

Considerable effort has been expended to isolate stem cells from a number of different tissues for use in regenerative medicine. For example U.S. Pat. No. 5 750 397 to Tsukamoto et al. discloses the isolation and growth of human hematopoietic stem cells that are reported to be capable of differentiating into lymphoid erythroid and myelomonocytic lineages. U.S. Pat. No. 5 736 396 to Bruder et al. discloses methods for lineage directed differentiation of isolated human mesenchymal stem cells under the influence of appropriate growth and or differentiation factors. The derived cells can then be introduced into a host for mesenchymal tissue regeneration or repair.

One area of intense interest relates to the use of embryonic stem ES cells which have been shown in mice to have the potential to differentiate into 5 all the different cell types of the animal. Mouse ES cells are derived from cells of the inner cell mass of early mouse embryos at the blastocyst stage and other pluripotent and or totipotent cells have been isolated from germinal tissue e.g. primordial germ cells PGCs . The ability of these pluripotent and or totipotent stem cells to proliferate in vitro in an undifferentiated state retain a 10 normal karyotype and retain the potential to differentiate to derivatives of all three embryonic germ layers endoderm mesoderm and ectoderm makes these cells attractive as potential sources of cells for use in regenerative therapies in post natal subjects.

The development of human ES hES cells has not been as successful as the advances that have been made with mouse ES cells. Thomson et al. reported pluripotent stem cells from lower primates U.S. Pat. No. 5 843 780 Thomson et al. 1995 92 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 7844 7848 and from humans Thomson et al. 1998 282 Science 1145 1 147 . Gearhart et al. generated human embryonic germ hEG cell lines from fetal gonadal tissue Shamblott et al. 1998 95 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 13726 1 3731 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 090 622 . Both hES and hEG cells have the desirable characteristics of pluripotent stem cells in that they are capable of being propagated in vitro without differentiating they generally maintain a normal karyotype and they remain capable of differentiating into a number of different cell types. Clonally derived human embryonic stem cell lines maintain pluripotency and proliferative potential for prolonged periods in culture Amit et al. 2000 227 Dev Biol271 278 .

One significant challenge to the use of ES cells or other pluripotent cells for regenerative therapy in a subject is to control the growth and differentiation of the cells into the particular cell type required for treatment of a subject. There have been several reports of the effect of growth factors on the differentiation of ES cells. For example Schuldiner et al. report the effects of eight growth factors on the differentiation of cells into different cell types from hES cells see Schuldiner et al. 2000 97 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 11307 11312 . As disclosed therein after initiating differentiation through embryoid body like formation the cells were cultured in the presence of bFGF TGFPI activin A BMP 4 HGF EGF PNGF or retinoic acid. Each growth factor had a unique effect on the differentiation pathway but none of the growth factors directed differentiation exclusively to one cell type.

Ideally it would be beneficial to be able to isolate and purify stem and or precursor cells from a subject that could be purified and or manipulated in vitro before being reintroduced into the subject for treatment purposes. The use of a subject s own cells would obviate the need to employ adjunct immunosuppressive therapy thereby maintaining the competency of the subject s immune system. However the current strategies for isolating ES cell lines particularly hES cell lines preclude isolating the cells from a subject and reintroducing them into the same subject.

Thus the search for other stem cell types from adult animals continues. For example mesenchymal stem cells MSCs are one such cell type. MSCs have been shown to have the potential to differentiate into several lineages including bone Haynesworth et al. 1992 13 Bone 81 88 cartilage Mackay et al. 1998 4 Tissue Eng 41 5 28 Yoo et al. 1998 80 J Bone Joint Surg Am 745 57 adipose tissue Pittenger et al. 2000 251 Curr Top Microbiol Immunol 11 tendon Young et al. 1998 16 J Orthop Res 406 13 muscle and stroma Caplan et al. 2001 7 Trends Mol Med 259 64 .

Another population of cells multipotent adult progenitor cells MAPCs has also been purified from bone marrow BM Reyes et al. 2001 98 Blood 25 261 5 2625 Reyes Vetfaillie 2001 938 Ann NY Acad Sci 231 235 . These cells have been shown to be capable of expansion in vitro for more than 100 population doublings without telomere shortening or the development of karyotypic abnormalities. MAPCs have also been shown to be able to differentiate under defined culture conditions into various mesenchymal cell 30 types e.g. osteoblasts chondroblasts adipocytes and skeletal myoblasts endothelium neuroectoderm cells and more recently into hepatocytes Schwartz et al. 2000 109 J Clin Invest 1291 1302 .

Additionally hematopoietic stem cells HSCs have been reported to be able to differentiate into numerous cell types. BM hematopoietic stem cells have been reported to be able to transdifferentiate into cells that express early heart Orlic et al. 2003 7 Pediatr Transplant 86 88 Makino et al. 1999 103 J Clin Invest 697 705 skeletal muscle Labarge Blau 2002 111 Cell 589 601 Corti et al. 2002 277 Exp Cell Res 74 85 neural Sanchez Ramos 2002 69 Neurosci Res 880 893 liver Petersen et al. 1999 284 Science 1 168 1 170 or pancreatic cell Lanus et al. 2003 111 J Clin Invest 843 850 Lee Stoffel 2003 111 J Clin Invest 799 801 markers. In vivo experiments in humans also demonstrated that transplantation of CD34 peripheral blood PB stem cells led to the appearance of donor derived hepatocytes Korbling et al. 2002 346 N Engl J Med 738 746 epithelial cells Korbling et al. 2002 346 N Engl J Med 738 746 and neurons Hao et al. 2003 12 J Hematother Stem Cell Res 23 32 . Additionally human BM derived cells have been shown to contribute to the regeneration of infarcted myocardium Stamm et al. 2003 361 Lancet 45 46 .

These reports have been interpreted as evidence for the existence of the phenomenon of transdifferentiation or plasticity of adult stem cells. However the concept of transdifferentiation of adult tissue specific stem cells is currently a topic of extensive disagreement within the scientific and medical communities see e.g. Lemischka 2002 30 Exp Hematol 848 852 Holden Vogel 2002 296 Science 21 26 21 29 . Studies attempting to reproduce results suggesting transdifferentiation with neural stem cells have been unsuccessful Castro et al. 2002 297 Science 1299 . It has also been shown that the hematopoietic stem progenitor cells HSPC found in muscle tissue originate in the BM 25 McKinney Freeman et al. 2002 99 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1341 1 346 Geiger et al. 100 Blood 721 723 Kawada Ogawa 2001 98 Blood 2008 2013 . Additionally studies with chimeric animals involving the transplantation of single HPCs into lethally irradiated mice demonstrated that transdifferentiation and or plasticity of circulating HPSC and or their progeny if it occurs at all is an extremely rare event Wagers et al. 2002 297 Science 2256 2259 .

Thus there continues to be a need for new approaches to generate populations of transplantable cells suitable for a variety of applications including but not limited to treating injury and or disease of various organs and or tissues.

SEQ ID NOS 65 80 are the nucleotide sequences of 8 primer pairs that can be used to amplify various human nucleic acid sequences as summarized in Table 2.

The present subject matter will be now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying Examples in which representative embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter are shown. The presently disclosed subject matter can however be embodied in different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete and will fully convey the scope of the presently disclosed subject matter to those skilled in the art.

The concept that hematopoietic stem cells HSC isolated from relatively easily accessible sources such as bone marrow BM mobilized peripheral blood mPB or cord blood CB could be subsequently employed as precursors for other stem cells necessary for regeneration of various solid organs e.g. heart brain liver or pancreas created excitement in the scientific community. It had been postulated that HSC possess germlayer unrestricted plasticity and can transdifferentiate into stem cells from all non hematopoietic lineages. Unfortunately the first promising reports showing a robust contribution of HSC to regeneration of different tissues were not reproduced by other investigators.

In response to this the scientific community became polarized in its view on stem cell plasticity. Several alternative explanations of previously reported data have been proposed. The first concept that was rapidly accepted was explaining stem cell plasticity through the phenomenon of cell fusion. Data were presented that donor derived HSC and or monocytes might fuse with differentiated cells present in recipient tissues leading to the creation of fused cells that have a double number of chromosomes in their nuclei and express cell surface and cytoplasmic markers that are derived from both parental cells.

Another explanation of stem cell plasticity is based on the appearance of epigenetic changes in cells exposed to external stimuli e.g. organ damage non physiological culture conditions and or other stresses . Both cell fusion and epigenetic changes however are extremely rare randomly occurring events that would not appear to fully account for the previously published positive trans dedifferentiation data. Furthermore fusion was excluded as a major contributor to the observed donor derived chimerism in several recently published studies.

The concept that BM might contain heterogeneous populations of stem cells was surprisingly not appreciated as a part of the discussion concerning stem cell plasticity. Disclosed herein is direct evidence that BM stem cells are heterogeneous and expected to be pluripotent. BM has been shown to contain endothelial bone skeletal muscle cardiac hepatic and neural tissue committed stem cells.

However these potential candidate cells had not been characterized well at the single cell level. As disclosed herein murine bone marrow BM contains a population of rare 0.02 of BMMNC Sca 1 lin CD45 cells that express markers of non hematopoietic stem cells. More importantly these rare cells were able to differentiate into cardiomyocytes pancreatic cells and grow neurospheres in in vitro cultures. These Sca 1 lin CD45 cells have the morphology of and express several markers of undifferentiated embryonic like stem cells.

Disclosed herein is the identification and purification from murine bone marrow BM of a subpopulation of rare CD34 lin CD45 human or Sca 1 lin CD45 mouse cells referred to herein as very small embryonic like VSEL stem cells . In addition to being Sca 1 lin CD45 or CD34 lin CD45 VSEL stem cells express markers of pluripotent stem cells PSC such as SSEA 1 Oct 4 Nanog and Rex 1. The direct electron microscopic analysis revealed that VSEL stem cells are small about 3 4 m possess large nuclei surrounded by a narrow rim of cytoplasm and contain open type chromatin euchromatin that is typical of embryonic stem cells. The number of VSEL stem cells is highest in BM from young 1 month old mice and decreases with age. It is also significantly diminished in short living DBA 2J mice as compared to long living C57BL 6 animals. VSEL stem cells respond strongly to SDF 1 HGF SF and LIF in vitro and express CXCR4 c met and LIF R. This population of VSEL stem cells expressing pluripotent and tissue committed stem cells markers can be a source of pluripotent stem cells for tissue and or organ regeneration.

All technical and scientific terms used herein unless otherwise defined below are intended to have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. References to techniques employed herein are intended to refer to the techniques as commonly understood in the art including variations on those techniques or substitutions of equivalent techniques that would be apparent to one of skill in the art. While the following terms are believed to be well understood by one of ordinary skill in the art the following definitions are set forth to facilitate explanation of the presently disclosed subject matter.

Following long standing patent law convention the terms a an and the mean one or more when used in this application including the claims. Thus the phrase a stem cell refers to one or more stem cells unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

The terms target tissue and target organ as used herein refer to an intended site for accumulation of VSEL stem cells and or an in vitro differentiated VSEL stem cell derivative following administration to a subject. For example in some embodiments the methods of the presently disclosed subject matter involve a target tissue or a target organ that has been damaged for example by ischemia or other injury.

The term control tissue as used herein refers to a site suspected to substantially lack accumulation of an administered cell. For example in accordance with the methods of the presently disclosed subject matter a tissue or organ that has not been injured or damaged is a representative control tissue as is a tissue or organ other than the intended target tissue. For example if the injury to be treated is a myocardial infarction the intended target tissue would be the heart and essentially all other tissues and organs in the subject can be considered control tissues.

The terms targeting and homing as used herein to describe the In vivo activity of a cell for example a VSEL stem cells and or an in vitro differentiated VSEL stem cell derivative thereof following administration to a subject and refer to the preferential movement and or accumulation of the cell in a target tissue as compared to a control tissue.

The terms selective targeting and selective homing as used herein refer to a preferential localization of a cell for example a VSEL stem cells and or an in vitro differentiated VSEL stem cell derivative thereof that results in an accumulation of the administered VSEL stem cells and or an in vitro differentiated VSEL stem cell derivative thereof in a target tissue that is in some embodiments about 2 fold greater than accumulation of the administered VSEL stem cells and or an in vitro differentiated VSEL stem cell derivative thereof in a control tissue in some embodiments accumulation of the administered VSEL stem cells and or an in vitro differentiated VSEL stem cell derivative thereof that is about 5 fold or greater and in some embodiments an accumulation of the administered VSEL stem cells and or an in vitro differentiated VSEL stem cell derivative thereof that is about 10 fold or greater than in an control tissue. The terms selective targeting and selective homing also refer to accumulation of a VSEL stem cells and or an in vitro differentiated VSEL stem cell derivative thereof in a target tissue concomitant with an absence of accumulation in a control tissue in some embodiments the absence of accumulation in all control tissues.

The term absence of targeting is used herein to describe substantially no binding or accumulation of a VSEL stem cells and or an in vitro differentiated VSEL stem cell derivative thereof in one or more control tissues under conditions wherein accumulation would be detectable if present. The phrase also is intended to include minimal background accumulation of a VSEL stem cells and or an in vitro differentiated VSEL stem cell derivative thereof in one or more control tissues under such conditions.

The term subject as used herein refers to a member of any invertebrate or vertebrate species. Accordingly the term subject is intended to encompass any member of the Kingdom Animalia including but not limited to the phylum ChordaSa i.e. members of Classes Osteichythyes bony fish Amphibia amphibians Reptilia reptiles Ayes birds and Mammalia mammals and all Orders and Families encompassed therein.

Similarly all genes gene names and gene products disclosed herein are intended to correspond to homologs from any species for which the compositions and methods disclosed herein are applicable. Thus the terms include but are not limited to genes and gene products from humans and mice. It is understood that when a gene or gene product from a particular species is disclosed this disclosure is intended to be exemplary only and is not to be interpreted as a limitation unless the context in which it appears clearly indicates. Thus for example for the genes listed in Tables 1 and 2 which disclose GENBANK Accession Nos. for the murine and human nucleic acid sequences respectively are intended to encompass homologous genes and gene products from other animals including but not limited to other mammals fish amphibians reptiles and birds.

The methods of the presently disclosed subject matter are particularly useful for warm blooded vertebrates. Thus the presently disclosed subject matter concerns mammals and birds. More particularly contemplated is the isolation manipulation and use of VSEL stem cells from mammals such as humans and other primates as well as those mammals of importance due to being endangered such as Siberian tigers of economic importance animals raised on farms for consumption by humans and or social importance animals kept as pets or in zoos to humans for instance carnivores other than humans such as cats and dogs swine pigs hogs and wild boars ruminants such as cattle oxen sheep giraffes deer goats bison and camels rodents such as mice rats and rabbits marsupials and horses. Also provided is the use of the disclosed methods and compositions on birds including those kinds of birds that are endangered kept in zoos as well as fowl and more particularly domesticated fowl e.g. poultry such as turkeys chickens ducks geese guinea fowl and the like as they are also of economic importance to humans. Thus also contemplated is the isolation manipulation and use of VSEL stem cells from livestock including but not limited to domesticated swine pigs and hogs ruminants horses poultry and the like.

The term about as used herein when referring to a measurable value such as an amount of weight time dose etc. is meant to encompass variations of in some embodiments 20 in some embodiments 10 in some embodiments 5 in some embodiments 1 and in some embodiments 0.1 from the specified amount as such variations are appropriate to perform the disclosed methods.

The term isolated as used in the context of a nucleic acid or polypeptide including for example a peptide indicates that the nucleic acid or polypeptide exists apart from its native environment. An isolated nucleic acid or polypeptide can exist in a purified form or can exist in a non native environment.

The terms nucleic acid molecule and nucleic acid refer to deoxyribonucleotides ribonucleotides and polymers thereof in single stranded or double stranded form. Unless specifically limited the term encompasses nucleic acids containing known analogues of natural nucleotides that have similar properties as the reference natural nucleic acid. The terms nucleic acid molecule and nucleic acid can also be used in place of gene cDNA and mRNA. Nucleic acids can be synthesized or can be derived from any biological source including any organism.

The term isolated as used in the context of a cell including for example a VSEL stem cell indicates that the cell exists apart from its native environment. An isolated cell can also exist in a purified form or can exist in a non native environment.

As used herein a cell exists in a purified form when it has been isolated away from all other cells that exist in its native environment but also when the proportion of that cell in a mixture of cells is greater than would be found in its native environment. Stated another way a cell is considered to be in purified form when the population of cells in question represents an enriched population of the cell of interest even if other cells and cell types are also present in the enriched population. A cell can be considered in purified form when it comprises in some embodiments at least about 10 of a mixed population of cells in some embodiments at least about 20 of a mixed population of cells in some embodiments at least about 25 of a mixed population of cells in some embodiments at least about 30 of a mixed population of cells in some embodiments at least about 40 of a mixed population of cells in some embodiments at least about 50 of a mixed population of cells in some embodiments at least about 60 of a mixed population of cells in some embodiments at least about 70 of a mixed population of cells in some embodiments at least about 75 of a mixed population of cells in some embodiments at least about 80 of a mixed population of cells in some embodiments at least about 90 of a mixed population of cells in some embodiments at least about 95 of a mixed population of cells and in some embodiments about 100 of a mixed population of cells with the proviso that the cell comprises a greater percentage of the total cell population in the purified population that it did in the population prior to the purification. In this respect the terms purified and enriched can be considered synonymous.

The presently disclosed subject matter provides methods of isolating a subpopulation of CD45 stem cells from a population of cells. In some embodiments the method comprises a providing a population of cells suspected of comprising CD45 stem cells b contacting the population of cells with a first antibody that is specific for CD45 and a second antibody that is specific for CD34 or Sca 1 under conditions sufficient to allow binding of each antibody to its target if present on each cell of the population of cells c selecting a first subpopulation of cells that are CD34 or Sca 1 and are also CD45 d contacting the first subpopulation of cells with one or more antibodies that are specific for one or more cell surface markers selected from the group including but not limited to CD45R B220 Gr 1 TCR TCR CD11b and Ter 119 under conditions sufficient to allow binding of each antibody to its target if present on each cell of the population of cells e removing from the first subpopulation of cells those cells that bind to at least one of the antibodies of step d and f collecting a second subpopulation of cells that are either CD34 lin CD45 or Sca 1 lin CD45 whereby a subpopulation of CD45 stem cells is isolated.

As used herein the term CD45 refers to a tyrosine phosphatase also known as the leukocyte common antigen LCA and having the gene symbol PTPRC. This gene corresponds to GENBANK Accession Nos. NP002829 25 human NP035340 mouse NP612516 rat XP002829 dog XP599431 cow and AAR16420 pig . The amino acid sequences of additional CD45 homologs are also present in the GENBANKB database including those from several fish species and several non human primates.

As used herein the term CD34 refers to a cell surface marker found on certain hematopoietic and non hematopoietic stem cells and having the gene symbol CD34. The GENBANK database discloses amino acid and nucleic acid sequences of CD34 from humans e.g. AAB25223 mice NP598415 rats XP223083 cats NP001009318 pigs MP999251 cows NP76434 and others.

In mice some stem cells also express the stem cell antigen Sca 1 GENBANK Accession No. NP034868 also referred to as Lymphocyte antigen Ly 6A.2.

Thus the subpopulation of CD45 stem cells represents a subpopulation of all CD45 cells that are present in the population of cells prior to the separating step. In some embodiments the subpopulation of CD45 stem cells are from a human and are CD34 CXCR4 lin CD45 . In some embodiments the subpopulation of CD45 stem cells are from a mouse and are Sca 1 lin CD45 .

The isolation of the disclosed subpopulations can be performed using any methodology that can separate cells based on expression or lack of expression of the one or more of the CD45 CXCR4 CD34 AC133 Sca 1 CD45R B220 Gr 1 TCR TCR CD11b and Ter 119 markers including but not limited to fluorescence activated cell sorting FACS .

As used herein lin refers to a cell that does not express any of the following markers CD45R B220 Gr 1 TCR TCR CD11b and Ter 119. These markers are found on cells of the B cell lineage from early Pro B to mature B cells CD45R B220 cells of the myeloid lineage such as monocytes during development in the bone marrow bone marrow granulocytes and peripheral neutrophils Gr 1 thymocytes peripheral T cells and intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes TCR and TCR myeloid cells NK cells some activated lymphocytes macrophages granulocytes B1 cells and a subset of dendritic cells CD11b and mature erythrocytes and erythroid precursor cells Ter 119 .

The separation step can be performed in a stepwise manner as a series of steps or concurrently. For example the presence or absence of each marker can be assessed individually producing two subpopulations at each step based on whether the individual marker is present. Thereafter the subpopulation of interest can be selected and further divided based on the presence or absence of the next marker.

Alternatively the subpopulation can be generated by separating out only those cells that have a particular marker profile wherein the phrase marker profile refers to a summary of the presence or absence of two or more markers. For example a mixed population of cells can contain both CD34 and CD34 cells. Similarly the same mixed population of cells can contain both CD45 and CD45 cells. Thus certain of these cells will be CD34 CD45 others will be CD34 CD45 others will be CD34 CD45 and others will be CD34 CD45 . Each of these individual combinations of markers represents a different marker profile. As additional markers are added the profiles can become more complex and correspond to a smaller and smaller percentage of the original mixed population of cells. In some embodiments the cells of the presently disclosed subject matter have a marker profile of CD34 CXCR4 lin CD45 and in some embodiments the cells of the presently disclosed subject matter have a marker profile of Sca 1 lin CD45 .

In some embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter antibodies specific for markers expressed by a cell type of interest e.g. polypeptides expressed on the surface of a CD34 CXCR4 lin CD45 or a Sca 1 lin CD45 cell are employed for isolation and or purification of subpopulations of BM cells that have marker profiles of interest. It is understood that based on the marker profile of interest the antibodies can be used to positively or negatively select fractions of a population which in some embodiments are then further fractionated.

In some embodiments a plurality of antibodies antibody derivatives and or antibody fragments with different specificities is employed. In some embodiments each antibody or fragment or derivative thereof is specific for a marker selected from the group including but not limited to Ly 6A E Sca 1 CD34 CXCR4 AC133 CD45 CD45R B220 Gr 1 TCR TCR CD11b Ter 119 c met LIF R SSEA 1 Oct 4 Rev 1 and Nanog. In some embodiments cells that express one or more genes selected from the group including but not limited to SSEA 1 Oct 4 Rev 1 and Nanog are isolated and or purified.

The presently disclosed subject matter relates to a population of cells that in some embodiments express the following antigens CXCR4 AC133 CD34 SSEA 1 mouse or SSEA 4 human fetal alkaline phosphatase AP c met and the LIF Receptor LIF R . In some embodiments the cells of the presently disclosed subject matter do not express the following antigens CD45 Lineage markers i.e. the cells are lin HLA DR MHC class I CD90 CD29 and CD105. Thus in some embodiments the cells of the presently disclosed subject matter can be characterized as follows CXCR4 AC133 CD34 SSEA 1 mouse or SSEA 4 human AP c met LIF R CD45 lin HLA DR MHC class I CD90 CD29 CD105 .

In some embodiments each antibody or fragment or derivative thereof comprises a detectable label. Different antibodies or fragments or derivatives thereof which bind to different markers can comprise different detectable labels or can employ the same detectable label.

A variety of detectable labels are known to the skilled artisan as are methods for conjugating the detectable labels to biomolecules such as antibodies and fragments and or derivatives thereof. As used herein the phrase detectable label refers to any moiety that can be added to an antibody or a fragment or derivative thereof that allows for the detection of the antibody. Representative detectable moieties include but are not limited to covalently attached chromophores fluorescent moieties enzymes antigens groups with specific reactivity chemiluminescent moieties and electrochemically detectable moieties etc. In some embodiments the antibodies are biotinylated. In some embodiments the biotinylated antibodies are detected using a secondary antibody that comprises an avidin or streptavidin group and is also conjugated to a fluorescent label including but not limited to Cy3 Cy5 and Cy7. In some embodiments the antibody fragment or derivative thereof is directly labeled with a fluorescent label such as Cy3 Cy5 or Cy7. In some embodiments the antibodies comprise biotin conjugated rat anti mouse Ly 6A E Sca 1 clone E1 3 161.7 streptavidin PE Cy5 conjugate anti CD45 APCCy7 clone 30 F11 anti CD45R B220 PE clone RA3 6B2 anti Gr 1 PE clone RB6 8C5 anti TCR PE clone H57 597 anti TCR PE clone GL3 anti CD11b PE clone M 1 70 and anti Ter 119 PE clone TER 119 . In some embodiments the antibody fragment or derivative thereof is directly labeled with a fluorescent label and cells that bind to the antibody are separated by fluorescence activated cell sorting. Additional detection strategies are known to the skilled artisan.

While FACS scanning is a convenient method for purifying subpopulations of cells it is understood that other methods can also be employed. An exemplary method that can be used is to employ antibodies that specifically bind to one or more of CD45 CXCR4 CD34 AC133 Sca 1 CD45R B220 Gr 1 TCR TCR CD11b and Ter 119 with the antibodies comprising a moiety e.g. biotin for which a high affinity binding reagent is available e.g. avidin or streptavidin . For example a biotin moiety could be attached to antibodies for each marker for which the presence on the cell surface is desirable e.g. CD34 Sca 1 CXCR4 and the cell population with bound antibodies could be contacted with an affinity reagent comprising an avidin or streptavidin moiety e.g. a column comprising avidin or streptavidin . Those cells that bound to the column would be recovered and further fractionated as desired. Alternatively the antibodies that bind to markers present on those cells in the population that are to be removed e.g. CD45R B220 Gr 1 TCR TCR CD11b and Ter 119 can be labeled with biotin and the cells that do not bind to the affinity reagent can be recovered and purified further.

It is also understood that different separation techniques e.g. affinity purification and FACS can be employed together at one or more steps of the purification process.

A population of cells containing the CD34 CXCR4 lin CD45 or Sca 1 lin CD45 cells of the presently disclosed subject matter can be isolated from any subject or from any source within a subject that contains them. In some embodiments the population of cells comprises a bone marrow sample a cord blood sample or a peripheral blood sample. In some embodiments the population of cells is isolated from peripheral blood of a subject subsequent to treating the subject with an amount of a mobilizing agent sufficient to mobilize the CD45 stem cells from bone marrow into the peripheral blood of the subject. As used herein the phrase mobilizing agent refers to a compound e.g. a peptide polypeptide small molecule or other agent that when administered to a subject results in the mobilization of a VSEL stem cell or a derivative thereof from the bone marrow of the subject to the peripheral blood. Stated another way administration of a mobilizing agent to a subject results in the presence in the subject s peripheral blood of an increased number of VSEL stem cells and or VSEL stem cell derivatives than were present therein immediately prior to the administration of the mobilizing agent. It is understood however that the effect of the mobilizing agent need not be instantaneous and typically involves a lag time during which the mobilizing agent acts on a tissue or cell type in the subject in order to produce its effect. In some embodiments the mobilizing agent comprises at least one of granulocyte colony stimulating factor G CSF and a CXCR4 antagonist e.g. a T140 peptide Tamamura et al. 1998 253 Biochem Biophys Res Comm 877 882 .

In some embodiments a VSEL stem cell or derivative thereof also expresses a marker selected from the group including but not limited to c met c kit LIF R and combinations thereof. In some embodiments the disclosed isolation methods further comprise isolating those cells that are c met c kit and or LI F R .

In some embodiments the VSEL stem cell or derivative thereof also expresses SSEA 1 Oct 4 Rev 1 and Nanog and in some embodiments the disclosed isolation methods further comprise isolating those cells that express these genes.

The presently disclosed subject matter also provides a population of CD45 stem cells isolated by the presently disclosed methods.

Disclosed herein is the isolation and or purification of subpopulations of CD34 CXCR4 lin CD45 or Sca 1 lin CD45 cells. These cells comprise a heterogeneous population of cells comprising pluripotent and tissue committed stem cells. Also disclosed herein are strategies that can be employed for purifying the disclosed subpopulations.

In some embodiments the heterogeneous subpopulation is further fractionated to enrich for VSEL stem cells of certain lineages. As disclosed herein the CD34 CXCR4 lin CD45 or Sca 1 lin CD45 subpopulations comprise VSEL stem cells for various tissues including but not limited to neural cells skeletal muscle cells cardiac cells liver cells intestinal epithelium cells pancreas cells endothelium cells epidermis cells and melanocytes. These cells can be further fractionated by purifying from the CD34 CXCR4 lin CD45 or Sca 1 lin CD45 subpopulations those cells that express one or more markers associated with these lineages. For example VSEL stem cells for neural tissue can be fractionated using reagents that detect the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein GFAP nestin III tubulin oligodendrocyte transcription factor 1 Olig1 and or oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 Olig2 . Similarly VSEL stem cells for skeletal muscle can be fractionated using reagents that detect the expression of Myf5 MyoD and or myogenin. Additional VSEL stem cell types and markers that can be employed include but are not limited to cardiomyocyte VSEL stem cells Nsx2.5 Csx GATA 4 liver cell VSEL stem cells Fetoprotein CK19 intestinal epithelium VSEL stem cells Nkx 2 3 Tcf4 pancreas cell TCSCs Nkx 6.1 Pdx 1 C peptide endothelial cell VSEL stem cells VE cadherin epidermal cell VSEL stem cells Krt 2 5 Krt 2 6a BNC and melanocyte VSEL stem cells DCT TYR TRP .

The presently disclosed subject matter also provides a method of differentiating VSEL stem cells. In some embodiments the methods comprise first generating an embryoid body like sphere. As used herein the phrases embryoid body like sphere and embryoid body like refer to an aggregate of cells that appears morphologically similar to an embryoid body formed by ES cells under appropriate in vitro culturing conditions. As used herein the phrase is used interchangeably with embryoid body to refer to such aggregates when the cells that make up the embryoid body are CD34 CXCR4 lin CD45 or Sca 1 lin CD45 cells isolated and or purified using the presently disclosed techniques. Methods of generating EBs from ES cells are known in the art see e.g. Martin Evans 1975 M. I. Sherman D. Solter Eds. pp. 169 187 Academic Press New York N.Y. United States of America Doetschman et al. 1985 87 J Embryol Exp Morphol 27 45 . Disclosed herein are methods to prepare EB like spheres from other multipotent and pluripotent cells including the CD34 CXCR4 lin CD45 or Sca 1 lin CD45 cells.

In some embodiments a method of forming an embryoid like body from a population of very small embryonic like VSEL stem cells or derivatives thereof comprises a providing a population of CD45 cells comprising VSEL stem cells or derivatives thereof and b culturing the VSEL stem cells or derivatives thereof in vitro in a medium comprising one or more factors that induce embryoid like body formation of the VSEL stem cells or derivatives thereof for a time sufficient for an embryoid like body to appear.

As used herein the term one or more factors that induce embryoid like body formation of the VSEL stem cells or derivatives thereof refers to a biomolecule or plurality of biomolecules that when in contact with a plurality of VSEL stem cells or derivatives thereof induces the VSEL stem cells or derivatives thereof to form one or more embryoid body EB like like spheres. In some embodiments the one or more factors that induce embryoid body like formation of the VSEL stem cells or derivatives thereof comprise epidermal growth factor EGF fibroblast growth factor 2 and combinations thereof. In some embodiments the one or more factors are provided to the VSEL stem cells or derivatives thereof by co culturing the VSEL stem cells or derivatives thereof with C2C12 cells.

Once EB like spheres are generated the cells therein can be differentiated in vitro by culturing the cells under appropriate conditions. In some embodiments a method of differentiating a very small embryonic like VSEL stem cell or derivative thereof into a cell type of interest in vitro comprises a providing an embryoid body like comprising VSEL stem cells or derivatives thereof and b culturing the embryoid body like in a culture medium comprising a differentiation inducing amount of one or more factors that induce differentiation of the VSEL stem cells or derivatives thereof into the cell type of interest until the cell type of interest appears in the in vitro culture.

As used herein the phrase differentiation inducing amount refers to an amount of a growth factor or other activator that when present within an in vitro differentiation medium causes a VSEL stem cell or derivative thereof to differentiate into a cell type of interest. In some embodiments the growth factor or other activator includes but is not limited to epidermal growth factor EGF fibroblast growth factor 2 FGF 2 nerve growth factor NGF basic fibroblast growth factor bFGF vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF transforming growth factor 1 TGF 1 and combinations thereof and or other supplements including but not limited to N2 supplement A B27 supplement and nicotinamide available from Stem Cell Technologies Inc. Vancouver British Columbia Canada . See also Fraichard et al. 1995 108 J Cell Sci 3181 3188.

The choice of growth factors and or other supplements can depend on the cell type desired into which the EB like spheres are to differentiate. In some embodiments the EB like spheres can be differentiated into neuronal derivatives including but not limited to neurons oligodendrocytes astrocytes and glial cells. As disclosed in EXAMPLE 22 EB like spheres can be differentiated into neuronal derivatives by culturing them in medium comprising NEUROCULT Basal Medium Stem Cell Technologies Inc. Vancouver British Columbia Canada supplemented with rhEGF FGF 2 and NGF. EB like spheres can be differentiated into endodermal derivatives by culturing them in medium comprising Activin A see EXAMPLE 23 . Also EB like spheres can be differentiated into cardiomyocytes by culturing them in medium comprising bFGF VEGF and TGFPI see EXAMPLE 24 .

Other cell types that can be generated in vitro from stem cells such as ES cells include but are not limited to hepatocytes Yamada et al. 2002 20 Stem Cells 146 1 54 hematopoietic cells and pancreatic cells.

The presently disclosed subject matter also provides a method for treating an injury to a tissue or organ in a subject the method comprising administering to the subject a pharmaceutical composition wherein the pharmaceutical composition comprises a plurality of isolated CD45 stem cells comprising VSEL stem cells in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in an amount and via a route sufficient to allow at least a fraction of the population of CD45 stem cells comprising VSEL stem cells to engraft the tissue and differentiate therein whereby the injury is treated.

As used herein the phrase treating an injury to a tissue or organ in a subject refers to both intervention designed to ameliorate the symptoms of causes of the injury in a subject e.g. after initiation of the disease process as well as to interventions that are designed to prevent the disease from occurring in the subject. Stated another way the terms treating and grammatical variants thereof are intended to be interpreted broadly to encompass meanings that refer to reducing the severity of and or to curing a disease as well as meanings that refer to prophylaxis. In this latter respect treating refers to preventing or otherwise enhancing the ability of the subject to resist the disease process.

The compositions of the presently disclosed subject matter comprise in some embodiments a composition that includes a carrier particularly a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as but not limited to a carrier pharmaceutically acceptable in humans. Any suitable pharmaceutical formulation can be used to prepare the compositions for administration to a subject.

For example suitable formulations can include aqueous and nonaqueous sterile injection solutions that can contain anti oxidants buffers bacteriostatics bactericidal antibiotics and solutes that render the formulation isotonic with the bodily fluids of the intended recipient.

It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above the formulations of the presently disclosed subject matter can include other agents conventional in the art with regard to the type of formulation in question. For example sterile pyrogen free aqueous and nonaqueous solutions can be used.

The therapeutic regimens and compositions of the presently disclosed subject matter can be used with additional adjuvants or biological response modifiers including but not limited to cytokines and other immunomodulating compounds.

Suitable methods for administration the cells of the presently disclosed subject matter include but are not limited to intravenous administration and delivery directly to the target tissue or organ. In some embodiments the method of administration encompasses features for regionalized delivery or accumulation of the cells at the site in need of treatment. In some embodiments the cells are delivered directly into the tissue or organ to be treated. In some embodiments selective delivery of the presently disclosed cells is accomplished by intravenous injection of cells where they home to the target tissue or organ and engraft therein. In some embodiments the presently disclosed cells home to the target tissue or organ as a result of the production of an SDF 1 gradient produced by the target tissue or organ which acts as a chemotactic attractant to the CXCR cells disclosed herein.

An effective dose of a composition of the presently disclosed subject matter is administered to a subject in need thereof. A treatment effective amount or a therapeutic amount is an amount of a therapeutic composition sufficient to produce a measurable response e.g. a biologically or clinically relevant response in a subject being treated . Actual dosage levels of active ingredients in the compositions of the presently disclosed subject matter can be varied so as to administer an amount of the active compound s that is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular subject. The selected dosage level will depend upon the activity of the therapeutic composition the route of administration combination with other drugs or treatments the severity of the condition being treated and the condition and prior medical history of the subject being treated. However it is within the skill of the art to start doses of the compound at levels lower than required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. The potency of a composition can vary and therefore a treatment effective amount can vary. However using the assay methods described herein one skilled in the art can readily assess the potency and efficacy of a candidate compound of the presently disclosed subject matter and adjust the therapeutic regimen accordingly.

After review of the disclosure of the presently disclosed subject matter presented herein one of ordinary skill in the art can tailor the dosages to an individual subject taking into account the particular formulation method of administration to be used with the composition and particular disease treated. Further calculations of dose can consider subject height and weight severity and stage of symptoms and the presence of additional deleterious physical conditions. Such adjustments or variations as well as evaluation of when and how to make such adjustments or variations are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art of medicine.

VSEL stem cells e.g. the CD34 CXCR4 lin CD45 or Sca 1 lin CD45 cells of the presently disclosed subject matter and or derivatives thereof can also be employed for producing chimeric animals using techniques known in the art applicable to ES cells see e.g. Nagy et al. 2003 . Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. United States of America Robertson 1991 44 Biol Reprod 238 45 Jaenisch 1988 240 Science 1468 1474 Robertson et al. 1986 323 Nature 445 447 Bradley et al. 1984 309 Nature 255 258. See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 650 550 5 777 195 . For example the cells can be injected into blastocysts or aggregated with morula stage embryos. In some embodiments a chimera produced by introducing a VSEL stem cell or a derivative thereof into a recipient is a germline chimera that can transmit the genome of the VSEL stem cell to a subsequent generation.

The VSEL stem cells and derivatives thereof disclosed herein can also be employed for monitoring differentiation of cells in a target tissue e.g. in a chimeric animal . For example chimeric animals can be generated using purified subpopulations of VSEL stem cells e.g. a purified subpopulation of cardiomyocyte VSEL stem cells and the differentiation and or development of derivatives of the VSEL stem cells can be examined in the chimera. In some embodiments the VSEL stem cell comprises a detectable marker e.g. a coding sequence encoding GFP operably linked to a promoter operable in the cells types to be monitored to facilitate distinguishing VSEL stem cell derivatives from cells derived from the host animal into which the VSEL stem cells were introduced.

Additionally the VSEL stem cells and derivatives thereof disclosed herein can also be employed for gene expression studies. For example gene expression profiles can be determined for VSEL stem cells and derivatives thereof including but not limited to purified subpopulations of VSEL stem cells which can then be compared to other cell types including but not limited to cell types that are either more or less differentiated than a VSEL stem cell. Stated another way since a VSEL stem cell is more differentiated than a totipotent cell yet less differentiated than a terminally differentiated cell VSEL stem cells and derivatives thereof can be employed for producing and comparing gene expression profiles among various cell types along a differentiation pathway from a totipotent cell to a terminally differentiated cell thereby identifying what genes are downregulated and upregulated as a cell differentiates from a totipotent cell to a VSEL stem cell to a terminally differentiated cell. Alternatively or in addition gene expression profiles can be compared between VSEL stem cells and ES cells to identify genes the expression of which differ between these stem cell types.

The presently disclosed cells and methods can also be employed for identifying an inducer of embryoid body like sphere formation. As used herein the phrase inducer of embryoid body like sphere formation refers to a molecule e.g. a biomolecule including but not limited to a polypeptide a peptide or a lipid that cause a plurality of VSEL stem cells or derivatives thereof to form one or more embryoid body like spheres under conditions wherein the VSEL stem cells or derivatives thereof do not otherwise form one or more embryoid body like spheres. In some embodiments such conditions include but are not limited to culturing in a culture medium in which in the absence of the inducer the VSEL stem cells or derivatives do not form one or more embryoid body like spheres but when the inducer is added to an identical culture medium results in the VSEL stem cells or derivatives thereof forming one or more embryoid body like spheres.

In some embodiments the instant methods comprise a preparing a cDNA library comprising a plurality of cDNA clones from a cell known to comprise the inducer b transforming a plurality of cells that do not comprise the inducer with the cDNA library c culturing a plurality VSEL stem cells or derivatives thereof in the presence of the transformed plurality of cells under conditions sufficient to cause the VSEL stem cells or derivatives thereof to form an embryoid body like sphere d isolating the transformed cell comprising the inducer e recovering a cDNA clone from the transformed cell and f identifying a polypeptide encoded by the cDNA clone recovered whereby an inducer of embryoid body like formation is identified. In some embodiments the plurality of cDNA clones are present within a cDNA cloning vector and the vector comprises at least one nucleotide sequence flanking at least one side of the cloning site in the vector into which the cDNA clones are inserted that can bind a primer such as a sequencing primer. In some embodiments both primer binding nucleotide sequences are present flanking each side of the cloning site allowing the cDNA insert to be amplified using the polymerase chain reaction PCR . Accordingly in some embodiments the instant methods further comprise amplifying the cDNA clone present in the transformed cell using primers that hybridize to primer sites flanking both sides of the cDNA cloning site and in some embodiments the identifying step is performed by sequencing the cDNA clone directly or by sequencing the amplified PCR product.

It is understood however that other methods that are within the skill of the ordinary artisan can also be employed to identify an inducer. For example in some embodiments the cell known to comprise the inducer is a C2C12 cell. C2C12 conditioned medium can be tested to determine whether the inducer present in C2C12 cultures is a diffusible molecule e.g. a peptide polypeptide or bioactive lipid . If the inducer is a diffusible molecule the C2C12 conditioned medium can be heat treated to determine whether the inducer is heat labile such as a peptide or polypeptide or not heat labile such as a bioactive lipid . Fractionation studies including but not limited to proteomic analysis and or lipid chromatography can then be employed to identify putative inducer.

If C2C12 conditioned medium does not comprise an inducer it implies that the inducer is present on C2C12 cells. Techniques that can be applied for identifying a membrane bound inducer that is present on C2C12 cells include but are not limited to the use of monoclonal antibodies and or siRNAs. Alternatively or in addition gene expression analysis can be employed including for example the use of gene arrays differential display etc.

When a putative inducer is identified its status as an inducer can be confirmed by transforming a cell line that does not contain the inducer with a nucleotide sequence encoding the inducer and confirming that the transformed cell line supports the formation of embryoid body like spheres by VSEL stem cells or derivatives thereof.

Additionally the VSEL stem cells and derivatives thereof can be employed for identifying other cells and cell lines that are capable of inducing formation of embryoid body like spheres. Exemplary cell lines that can be examined include but are not limited to murine fetal fibroblasts and other murine and human malignant cell lines e.g. teratomas and sarcomas .

The present invention also provides for an elective healthcare insurance model using an individual s own VSELs for the individual s future healthcare uses such as repair of myocardial infarction. An individual can elect to have his or her own VSELs collected processed and preserved for future distribution for his or her healthcare needs. Preferably the VSELs are collected while the donor is in healthy or pre disease state. The process includes methods of collection processing and preservation of VSELs during non diseased state. Such methods are disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2006 0233768 and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2008 0038231 each of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.

According to other preferred embodiments compositions and methods are provided for treating a patient in need thereof comprising administering to a subject an autologous VSEL enriched population of cells.

Preferably the subject or person is in a non disease or pre disease state. It should be noted that the term pre disease state versus post disease state as used herein covers the absolute term of healthy no disease versus not healthy diseased and a relative term of a gradation in the disease progression healthier than or less diseased than post disease state . Since pre disease can be defined by a time prior to a subject being diagnosed with a disease the subject could be healthy in an absolute term or might already have the disease where the disease has not yet manifested itself not yet been diagnosed or not yet detected. Even in the latter scenario for such a pre disease state it is possible that the disease may not be so widespread such that it has reached the cells collected or even if the cells collected are diseased they may be less aggressive or are of a healthier grade due to the early stage of their development or the cells still retain some functioning necessary to combat the same disease and or other diseases. Thus the term healthy cells covers both the absolute term that the cells are healthy and the term that relatively speaking these collected cells from the subject before he becomes a patient are healthier than what the patient in his post disease state currently have in his body.

Specifically pre disease state could refer to prior diagnosis or knowledge of a specific targeted disease or diseases or class or classes of diseases of the subject collectively specific diseases such that stem cell can be collected from the subject at an opportune time in anticipation of the subject manifesting the specific diseases in the future. For example in view of family health history genetic history and or profiling a subject may be deemed to have a certain probability of contracting a certain specific disease e.g. a certain cancer during adult years.

Other definitions of pre disease state may be adopted without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention. For example certain standards may be established to pre diagnose the stem cell subject as being in a pre disease state. This type of pre diagnosis may be established as an optional screening process prior to collection of VSELs from the subject in the pre disease state. Such pre disease state standards may include one or more of the following considerations or references prior to collection such as a pre specific disease b prior to actual knowledge by subject and or health professionals of specific or general diseases c prior to contraction and or diagnosis of one or more classes of diseases d prior to one or more threshold parameters of the subject relating to certain diseases for example at a certain age with respect to certain physical conditions and or symptoms with respect to certain specific diseases with respect to certain prior treatment history and or preventive treatment etc. e whether the subject fits into one or more established statistical and or demographic models or profiles e.g. statistically unlikely to acquire certain diseases and f whether the subject is in a certain acceptable health condition as perceived based on prevailing medical practices.

The present invention provides an elective healthcare insurance model using an individual s own peripheral blood VSELs for the individual s future healthcare uses. More specifically this invention provides a method in which an individual can elect to have his or her own VSELs collected processed and preserved while he or she is in healthy state for future distribution for his or her healthcare needs. The invention also embodies methods of collection processing preservation and distribution of adult including pediatric peripheral blood VSELs during non diseased state. The VSELs collected will contain adequate dosage amounts for one or more transplantations immediately when needed by the individual for future healthcare treatments.

The VSELs of the present invention may be collected from bone marrow peripheral blood preferably mobilized peripheral blood spleen cord blood and combinations thereof. The VSELs may be collected from the respective sources using any means known in the art. Generally the method of collecting VSELs from a subject will include collecting a population of total nucleated cells and further enriching the population for VSELs.

According to another preferred embodiment there is provided a method for collecting an adequate VSEL dosage from an individual donor during non diseased state processing the VSELs collected cryogenically preserving them for future distribution for the donor s healthcare needs. In one embodiment of the current invention VSELs and progenitor cells are collected during the non disease or pre disease phase by the process of apheresis from adult or pediatric peripheral blood processed to optimize the quantity and quality of the collected VSELs cryogenically preserved and used for autologous therapeutic purposes when needed after they have been thawed. Autologous therapeutic purposes are those in which the cells collected from the donor are infused into that donor at a later time.

According to a preferred embodiment the VSELs may be collected by an apheresis process which typically utilizes an apheresis instrument.

According to a preferred embodiment there is provided a method for collecting autologous VSELs from a pre disease human subject collecting VSELs from peripheral blood pre disease human subject using an apheresis process at the time of collection earmarking the collected cells for use by the human subject and preserving the collected cells to maintain the cellular integrity of the cells. The human subject may be an adult human or non neonate child. Accordingly the above processes may further include the collection of adult or non neonate child peripheral blood VSELs where the cells are then aliquoted into defined dosage fractions before cryopreservation so that cells can be withdrawn from storage without the necessity of thawing all of the collected cells.

Collection may be performed on any person including adult or a non neonate child. Furthermore collection may involve one or more collecting steps or collecting periods. For example collection e.g. using an apheresis process may be performed at least two times at least three times or at least 5 times on a person. During each collecting step the number of total nucleated cells collected per kilogram weight of the person may be one million 1 10 or more e.g. 1 10 1 10 1 10 1 10 1 10 1 10 1 10 1 10 1 10 1 10 1 10 1 10 1 10 1 10 . In preferred embodiments the number of cells collected in a single collection session may be equal or greater than 1 10total nucleated cells or at least on the order of 10 or 10 or 10 or 10 or 10 or 10 or 10 or 10 or 10 or 10total nucleated cells depending on the weight and age of the donor.

Depending on the situation and the quantity and quality of VSELs to be collected from the donor it may be preferable to collect the VSELs from donors when they are at an adult or a matured age the term adult as used herein refers to and includes adult and non neonate unless otherwise used in a particular context to take a different meaning and or at a certain minimum weight. For example VSELs are collected when the subject is within a range from 10 to 200 kg in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention or any range within such range such as 20 to 40 kg. In addition or in the alternative it may be required that the subject be of a certain age within a range from 2 80 years old e.g. 2 10 10 15 12 18 16 20 20 26 26 30 30 35 30 40 40 45 40 50 55 60 60 65 60 70 and 70 80 years old in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.

The amount of VSELs circulating in the peripheral blood cell may be increased with the infusion of cell growth factors prior to collection such as for example granulocyte colony stimulating factor G CSF . The infusion of growth factors is routinely given to bone marrow and peripheral blood donors and has not been associated with any long lasting untoward effects. Adverse side effects are not common but include the possibility of pain in the long bones sternum and pelvis mild headache mild nausea and a transient elevation in temperature. The growth factor is given 1 6 days before peripheral blood VSELs are collected. 1 6 days after G SCF is infused the peripheral blood VSELs are sterilely collected by an apheresis instrument.

In a preferred embodiment there is provided a method of mobilizing a significant number of peripheral blood VSELs comprising the administration of a stem cell potentiating agent. The function of the stem cell potentiating agent is to increase the number or quality of the VSELs that can be collected from the person. These agents include but are not limited to G CSF GM CSF dexamethazone a CXCR4 receptors inhibitor Interleukin 1 IL 1 Interleukin 3 IL 3 Interleukin 8 IL 8 PIXY 321 GM CSF IL 3 fusion protein macrophage inflammatory protein stem cell factor thrombopoietin and growth related oncogene as single agents or in combination. In a preferred embodiment there is provided a method of mobilizing a significant number of peripheral blood VSELs comprising the administration of G CSF to a predisease subject.

According to a preferred embodiment the G CSF is administered to a predisease subject over a 1 to 6 day course which ends upon apheresis of the subjects peripheral blood. Preferably the G CSF is administered to a predisease subject at least twice over a 2 to 6 day period. For example G CSF may be administered on day 1 and day 3 or may be administered on day 1 day 3 and day 5 or alternatively day 1 day 2 and day 5. Most preferably G CSF is administered to a predisease subject twice for consecutive days over a 3 day course. Thus according to the preferred embodiment G CSF is administered to a predisease subject on day 1 and day 2 followed by apheresis on day 3.

Additionally according to preferred embodiments a low dose G CSF is administered to a subject. Thus a subject may receive a dose of G CSF of about 1 g kg day to 8 g kg day. Preferably G CSF is administered to a subject at a dose of about 2 to about 7 g kg day or equivalent thereof. More preferably G CSF is administered to a subject at a dose of about 4 to about 6 g kg day or equivalent thereof. For subcutaneous injections the dose of G CSF may be from about 50 g to about 800 g preferably from about 100 g to about 600 g more preferably from about 250 g to 500 g and most preferably from about 300 g to about 500 g.

Accordingly to another preferred embodiment antagonist or inhibitors of CXCR4 receptors may be used as a stem cell potentiating agents. Examples of CXCR4 inhibitors that have been found to increase the amount of VSELs in the peripheral blood include but are not limited to AMD3100 ALX40 4C T22 T134 T140 and TAK 779. See also U.S. Pat. No. 7 169 750 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. These stem cell potentiating agents may be administered to the person before the collecting step. For example the potentiating agent may be administered at least one day at least three days or at least one week before the collecting step. Preferably the CXCR4 inhibitors are administered to a predisease subject at least twice over a 2 to 6 day period. For example the CXCR4 inhibitors may be administered on day 1 and day 3 or may be administered on day 1 day 3 and day 5 or alternatively day 1 day 2 and day 5. Most preferably the CXCR4 inhibitors are administered to a predisease subject twice for consecutive days over a 3 day course. Thus according to the preferred embodiment the CXCR4 inhibitors are administered to a predisease subject on day 1 and day 2 followed by apheresis on day 3.

The formulation and route of administration chosen will be tailored to the individual subject the nature of the condition to be treated in the subject and generally the judgment of the attending practitioner. Suitable dosage ranges for CXCR4 inhibitors vary according to these considerations but in general the compounds are administered in the range of about 0.1 g kg to 5 mg kg of body weight preferably the range is about 1 g kg to 300 g kg of body weight more preferably about 10 g kg to 100 g kg of body weight. For a typical 70 kg human subject thus the dosage range is from about 0.7 g to 350 mg preferably about 700 g to 21 mg most preferably about 700 g to 7 mg. Dosages may be higher when the compounds are administered orally or transdermally as compared to for example i.v. administration.

In some embodiments of the invention after collection the VSELs are processed according to methods known in the art see for example Lasky L. C. and Warkentin P. I. Marrow and Stem Cell Processing for Transplantation American Association of Blood Banks 2002 . In an embodiment of the invention processing may include the following steps preparation of containers e.g. tubes and labels sampling and or testing of the collected material centrifugation transfer of material from collection containers to storage containers the addition of cryoprotectant etc. In some embodiments after processing some of the processed VSELs can be made available for further testing.

The cells also may be processed preferably before the preservation step is conducted. Processing may involve for example enrichment or depletion of cells with certain cell surface markers. Any cell surface marker including the cell surface markers listed anywhere in this specification may be used as a criteria for enrichment or depletion. Furthermore processing may involve analyzing at least one characteristic of one cell in the one population of VSELs or the at least one population of non VSELs. The characteristic may be a DNA or RNA sequence. For example the genomic DNA or RNA may be partially or completely sequenced determined . Alternatively specific regions of the DNA or RNA of a cell may be sequenced. For example nucleic acids from a cell or a cell population may be extracted. Specific regions of these nucleic acid may be amplified using amplification probes in an amplification process. The amplification process may be for example PCR or LCR. After amplification the amplimers products of amplification may be sequenced. Furthermore the DNA and RNA may be analyzed using gene chips using hybridization or other technologies.

Specific uniqueness of this invention is that there will be no requirement for any kind of tissue typing since the collected VSELs will be used for autologous transplantation. However tissue typing of specific kinds may be used for sample identification or for the use of these VSELs for possible allogeneic use. This type of information may include genotypic or phenotypic information. Phenotypic information may include any observable or measurable characteristic either at a macroscopic or system level or microscopic cellular or molecular level. Genotypic information may refer to a specific genetic composition of a specific individual organism including one or more variations or mutations in the genetic composition of the individual s genome and the possible relationship of that genetic composition to disease. An example of this genotypic information is the genetic fingerprint and the Human Leukocyte Antigen HLA type of the donor. In some embodiments of the invention the VSELs will be processed in such a way that defined dosages for transplantation will be identified and aliquoted into appropriate containers.

In preferred embodiments the number of cells in the VSEL enriched population may be equal or greater than 2 10total nucleated cells or at least on the order of 10 or 10 or 10 or 10 depending on the weight and age of the donor. Aliquoting of these cells may be performed so that a quantity of cells sufficient for one transplant will be stored in one cryocyte bag or tube while quantities of cells appropriate for micro transplantation supplemental stem cell infusion will be stored in appropriate containers cryocyte bags or cryotubes . Generally at least one unit is collected at each collection session and each unit collected is targeted at more than on the order of 10 more preferably 10 more preferably 10 and most preferably 10 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. This process constitutes a unique process for unitized storage enabling individuals to withdraw quantities of cells for autologous use without the necessity of thawing the total volume of cells in storage further details discussed below . This may include processing the harvested VSELs to optimize the quantity of total nucleated cells to ensure sufficient number of cells for targeted diseases without or with little waste of cells i.e. disease directed dosage . Fault tolerant and redundant computer systems will be used for data processing to maintaining records relating to subject information and to ensure rapid and efficient retrieval VSELs from the storage repositories.

The enrichment procedures preferably includes sorting the cells by size and or cellular markers. For example stem cells comprise approximately 0.1 1.0 of the total nucleated cells as measured by the surrogate CD34 cells. Thus stem cells may be sorted by their expression of CD34 . VSELs do not express CD45 and thus cells expressing CD45 may be sorted out of the desired VSEL enriched population. VSEL stem cells express markers of pluripotent stem cells such as SSEA 1 Oct 4 Nanog and Rex 1 and thus similar strategies my be employed using these markers. VSEL enriched populations of stem cells may similarly be prepared by sorting TNC populations by size either alone or in combination with other sorting strategies in order to prepare VSEL enriched populations of cells.

In one aspect of the invention the cells collected by the methods of the invention may be sorted into at least two subpopulations which may be cryopreserved separately or together e.g. in the same vial . The at least two subpopulations of cells may be two subpopulation of VSELs. However the at least two subpopulation of cells may be 1 a stem cell population or a population enriched for VSELs and 2 a non stem cell population or a population depleted for VSELs. Furthermore it is also envisioned that the two subpopulations i.e. 1 and 2 above may be cryopreserved together.

VSELs may be sorted according to cell surface markers that are associated with VSELs. Since it is one embodiment of the invention to enrich for VSELs useful markers for cell sorting need not be exclusively expressed in VSELs. A cell marker which is not exclusively expressed in stem cell will nevertheless have utility in enriching for VSELs. It should noted also that markers of differentiated cells are also useful in the methods of the invention because these markers may be used for example to selectively remove differentiated cells and thus enrich VSELs in the remaining cell population. Markers cell surface or otherwise which may be used in any of the processes of the invention include at least the following Fetal liver kinase 1 Flk1 Bone specific alkaline phosphatase BAP Bone morphogenetic protein receptor BMPR CD34 CD34 Sca Lin profile CD38 c Kit Colony forming unit CFU Fibroblast colony forming unit CFU F Hoechst dye KDR Leukocyte common antigen CD45 Lineage surface antigen Lin Muc 18 CD146 Stem cell antigen Sca 1 Stro 1 antigen Thy 1 CD14 Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule PECAM 1 or CD31 CD73 Adipocyte lipid binding protein ALBP Fatty acid transporter FAT Adipocyte lipid binding protein ALBP B 1 integrin CD133 Glial fibrillary acidic protein GFAP O4 CD166 Cytokeratin 19 CK19 Nestin Alkaline phosphatase Alpha fetoprotein AFP Bone morphogenetic protein 4 Brachyury Cluster designation 30 CD30 Cripto TDGF 1 GATA 4 gene GCTM 2 Genesis Germ cell nuclear factor Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 HNF 4 Nestin Neuronal cell adhesion molecule N CAM Oct 4 Pax6 Stage specific embryonic antigen 3 SSEA 3 Stage specific embryonic antigen 4 SSEA 4 Stem cell factor SCF or c Kit ligand Telomerase TRA 1 60 TRA 1 81 Vimentin MyoD and Pax7 Myogenin and MR4 CD36 FAT and CD29.

The pattern of markers express by VSELs may also be used to sort and categorize VSELs with greater accuracy. Any means of characterizing including the detection of markers or array of markers may be used to characterized and or identify the cells obtained through the embodiments disclosed herein. For example certain cell types are known to express a certain pattern of markers and the cells collected by the processes described herein may be sorted on the basis of these known patterns. Multiparameter sorting may also be employed. The table that follows provides examples of the identifying pattern or array of markers that may be expressed by certain cell types.

The size of the VSELs may also form a basis to devise a sorting strategy to prepare an enriched population of VSELs. A combination of cellular markers and size patterns may be used to sort and categorize VSELs with greater accuracy. Generally an enriched population of VSELs is prepared by sorting for a size between 2 10 m. In some embodiments an enriched population of VSELs is prepared by sorting for a size between 2 8 m. In some embodiments an enriched population of VSELs is prepared by sorting for a size between 2 6 m. In some embodiments an enriched population of VSELs is prepared by sorting for a size between 2 5 m. In some embodiments an enriched population of VSELs is prepared by sorting for a size between 2 4 m. In some embodiments an enriched population of VSELs is prepared by sorting for a size between 3 5 m. In some embodiments an enriched population of VSELs is prepared by sorting for a size between 3 6 m. In some embodiments an enriched population of VSELs is prepared by sorting for a size between 3 8 m.

In one embodiment of the present invention the VSELs are collected from the peripheral blood of a subject and introduced or transplanted back to the individual when the subject is in need of such cellular therapy.

VSELs and compositions comprising VSELs of the present invention can be used to repair treat or ameliorate various aesthetic or functional conditions e.g. defects through the augmentation of damage tissues. The VSELs of the present embodiments may provide an important resource for rebuilding or augmenting damaged tissues and thus represent a new source of medically useful VSELs. In a preferred embodiment the VSELs may be used in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine for the replacement of body parts that have been damaged by developmental defects injury disease or the wear and tear of aging. The VSELs provide a unique system in which the cells can be differentiated to give rise to specific lineages of the same individual or genotypes. The VSELs therefore provide significant advantages for individualized stem cell therapy.

In addition such VSELs and compositions thereof can be used for augmenting soft tissue not associated with injury by adding bulk to a soft tissue area opening depression or void in the absence of disease or trauma such as for smoothing . Multiple and successive administrations of VSELs are also embraced by the present invention.

For stem cell based treatments a VSELs are preferably collected from an autologous or heterologous human or animal source. An autologous animal or human source is more preferred. Stem cell compositions are then prepared and isolated as described herein. To introduce or transplant the VSELs and or compositions comprising the VSELs according to the present invention into a human or animal recipient a suspension of mononucleated cells is prepared. Such suspensions contain concentrations of the VSELs of the invention in a physiologically acceptable carrier excipient or diluent. Alternatively stem cell suspensions may be in serum free sterile solutions such as cryopreservation solutions. Enriched stem cell preparations may also be used. The stems suspensions may then be introduced e.g. via injection into one or more sites of the donor tissue.

Concentrated or enriched cells may be administered as a pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable preparation or composition containing a physiologically acceptable carrier excipient or diluent and administered to the tissues of the recipient organism of interest including humans and non human animals. The stem cell containing composition may be prepared by resuspending the cells in a suitable liquid or solution such as sterile physiological saline or other physiologically acceptable injectable aqueous liquids. The amounts of the components to be used in such compositions can be routinely determined by those having skill in the art.

The VSELs or compositions thereof may be administered by placement of the stem cell suspensions onto absorbent or adherent material i.e. a collagen sponge matrix and insertion of the stem cell containing material into or onto the site of interest. Alternatively the VSELs may be administered by parenteral routes of injection including subcutaneous intravenous intramuscular and intrasternal. Other modes of administration include but are not limited to intranasal intrathecal intracutaneous percutaneous enteral and sublingual. In one embodiment of the present invention administration of the VSELs may be mediated by endoscopic surgery.

For injectable administration the composition is in sterile solution or suspension or may be resuspended in pharmaceutically and physiologically acceptable aqueous or oleaginous vehicles which may contain preservatives stabilizers and material for rendering the solution or suspension isotonic with body fluids i.e. blood of the recipient. Non limiting examples of excipients suitable for use include water phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4 0.15 M aqueous sodium chloride solution dextrose glycerol dilute ethanol and the like and mixtures thereof. Illustrative stabilizers are polyethylene glycol proteins saccharides amino acids inorganic acids and organic acids which may be used either on their own or as admixtures. The amounts or quantities as well as the routes of administration used are determined on an individual basis and correspond to the amounts used in similar types of applications or indications known to those of skill in the art.

Consistent with the present invention the VSELs may be administered to body tissues including epithelial tissue i.e. skin lumen etc. muscle tissue i.e. smooth muscle blood brain and various organ tissues such as those organs that are associated with the urological system i.e. bladder urethra ureter kidneys etc. .

According to another preferred embodiment there is provided compositions and methods for enhancing engraftment of the peripheral blood VSELs. The cells collected from the peripheral blood of a subject may generally comprise a comprehensive mixture of cells. That is there exist a mixture of VSELs partially differentiated cells e.g. progenitor cells or fibroblasts and functional cells i.e. terminally differentiated cells . The presence of progenitor cells partially and possibly terminally differentiated cells may have significant advantages with respect to a shorter time to reconstitution and other physiological benefits in the post infusion period.

According to the general treatment method described herein the cellular mixture obtained through an apheresis process may be administered to a subject for example by infusion into the blood stream of a subject through an intravenous i.v. catheter like any other i.v. fluid. Alternatively however an individualized mixture of cells may be generated such as to provide a cellular therapy mixture specific for therapeutic needs of a subject. The comprehensive mixture of cells obtained such as through an apheresis process may be characterized sorted and segregated into distinct cell populations. Cell markers such as VSELs markers or tissue specific markers may be used to phenotypically characterize the populations of cells collected from the peripheral blood. Using these markers it is possible to segregate and sort on the basis of cell type. The mixture of cells is thus transformed into populations of cells which may be broadly classified into two portions a stem cell portion and a non stem cell portion. The non stem cell portion may further be classified into a progenitor cell or fibroblast portion and a function cell or fully differentiated cell portion. Once the peripheral blood cellular mixture is sorted the stem cell and non stem cell portions may be cryopreserved and stored separately. In this manner a library or repository of distinct cell populations from a subject may be created. Alternatively stem cell and non stem cell portions may the cryopreserved together and then sorted and separated prior to use.

The types of cell populations that may be generated in this manner include any population of a cell type that developed from a germ layer i.e. endoderm mesoderm and ectoderm .

The instant co inventors demonstrated previously that BM contains a population of hematopoietic Sca 1 lin CD45 and a population of nonhematopoietic Sca 1 lin CD45 stem cells Kucia et al. 2005b 19 Leukemia 1118 1127 and that the latter cells are highly enriched in mRNA for markers of early VSEL stem cells. See Kucia et al. 2005b 33 Exp Hematol 61 3 623 and Kucia et al. 2004b Circ Res 1191 1199. Disclosed herein is an evaluation of the morphology of these rare cells by employing transmission electron microscopy TEM .

As shown in Sca 1 lin CD45 cells as compared to Sca 1 lin CD45 cells are smaller in size 3 4 m vs. 8 10 m contain relatively large nuclei and have a narrow rim of cytoplasm. Additionally DNA in the nuclei of these small Sca 1 lin CD45 cells contain open type euchromatin that is characteristic of pluripotent embryonic stem cells see . Thus disclosed herein for the first time is morphological evidence for the presence of embryonic like cells in adult BM.

Sca 1 lin CD45 cells express mRNA typical for VSEL stem cells. As disclosed herein an expanded panel of genes for several markers of VSEL stem cells for neural tissue skeletal and heart muscle liver pancreas epidermis melanocytes and intestinal epithelium see Table 3 was evaluated.

Interestingly it was determined that these cells also express mRNA typically associated with PSC including Oct 4 Nanog Rex1 and Dppa3 and are enriched in mRNA for telomerase protein Rif1 see Table 4 . Additionally the instant disclosure provides evidence that purified Sca 1 lin CD45 cells express several embryonic stem cell markers including SSEA 1 Oct 4 and Nanog at the protein level see . As depicted therein SSEA 1 Oct 4 and Nanog were detectable on 57 7 43 6 and 28 4 of Sca 1 lin CD45 cells respectively demonstrating that PSC proteins are expressed in a freshly isolated defined population of cells from the BM.

Previous studies have demonstrated that BM derived cells that express markers of VSEL stem cells could be isolated from a suspension of BMMNC by employing chemotaxis to stromal derived factor 1 SDF 1 hepatocyte growth factor scatter factor HGFISF or leukemia inhibitory factor LIF gradients Ratajczak et al. 2004b 18 Leukemia 29 40 . As disclosed herein the corresponding population of Sca 1 lin CD45 cells purified by FACS were examined for expression of the corresponding receptors CXCR4 c met and LIF R . shows that Sca 1 lin CD45 cells sorted by FACS express mRNA for all of these receptors. Additionally as shown in expression of these receptors was also confirmed by immunostaining. These receptors were present on 82 6 CXCR4 61 8 c met and 43 5 LIF R of purified Sca 1 lin CD45 cells. Furthermore in direct chemotactic studies it was determined that these highly purified cells respond robustly to SDF 1 see HGF SF and LIF gradients.

Previous RQ PCR data generated by the co inventors suggested that BM from young mice contains more PSC and or VSEL stem cells than does BM 5 from older mice Kucia et al. 2005b Leukemia 1118 1127 . As shown in by employing FACS analysis of BMMNC derived from 1 month old and 1 year old mice it has been determined that the number of Sca 1 lin CD45 cells is reduced by about 6 10 times in BM from older animals lower panel . Furthermore the FACS analysis disclosed herein 10 corresponded with a significant decrease of mRNA expression for PSC and VSEL stem cell markers in BMMNC isolated from older animals as evaluated by RQ PCR .

Also disclosed herein is the discovery that the number of Sca 1 lin CD45 cells varies with murine strain. In particular it is shown that the number of these cells is reduced in short living DBA 2J mice as compared to long living C57BL 6 mice. The data presented in demonstrated that in fact mRNA for several PSC VSEL stem cells is significantly lower in mRNA isolated from BMMNC from 3 weeks old DBA 2J mice.

It is known that the side population SP of BMMNC is highly enriched in stem cells see e.g. Goodell et al. 1996 183 J Exp Med 1797 1 806 Jackson et al. 2001 107 J Clin Invest 1395 1 402 Macpherson et al. 118 J Cell Sci 2441 2450 . To address whether the embryonic like stem cells identified by the techniques disclosed herein are present in SP of BMMNC a side population of BMMNC was isolated from BM see . For comparison Sca 1 lin CD45 cells were isolated from the same marrow samples see .

Subsequently both Sca 1 lin CD45 SP Sca 1 lin CD45 and Sca 1 lin CD45 SP Sca 1 lin CD45 cells were isolated from SP BMMNC. All of these populations of cells were compared along with unpurified BMMNC for expression of mRNA for early PSC VSEL stem cells. As shown in SP is highly enriched in mRNA for markers of PSC VSEL stem cells. However calculations of the total yield of Sca 1 lin CD45 cells isolated from the same number of BMMNC revealed that the number of Sca 1 lin CD45 cells resorted from SP was about two orders of magnitude lower when compared to direct sorting of these cells from the lymph gate of BMMNC. Additionally SP cells depleted from a population of Sca 1 lin CD45 did not express mRNA for PSC VSEL stem cells which suggests that the SP Sca 1 lin CD45 cells probably account for the pluripotency of SP cells.

Several assays were employed to evaluate if embryonic like cells isolated from BM possess hematopoietic potential. First it was determined if these cells are able to grow in vitro hematopoietic colonies but no clonogenic activity of these cells was detected. Next Sca 1 lin CD45 in contrast to Sca 1 lin CD45 cell did not radioprotect lethally irradiated mice or form CFU S colonies in lethally irradiated syngeneic recipients.

To address if these cells were be enriched for some long term hematopoietic repopulating stem cells the contribution of these cells to long term repopulation of the hematopoietic system after transplantation to lethally irradiated mice was studied by employing donor recipient animals congenic at the Ly.5 locus. Transplantation of 10Sca 1 lin CD45 cells from Ly5.1 mice along with 10BMMNC of Ly5.2 cells into Ly5.2 recipient mice resulted in about 17 3 chimerism of mice n 6 as evaluated 8 months after transplantation. No contribution of donor cells to hematopoiesis was observed in similar experiments after transplantation of 2 10Sca 1 lin CD45 cells co transplanted with 10BMMNC see . Similar results were obtained in similar experiments after transplantation of green immunofluorescence positive GFP Sca 1 lin CD45 and Sca 1 lin CD45 cells into lethally irradiated syngeneic recipients.

Contribution of BM derived cells to organ regeneration has been explained by some investigators to involve the phenomenon of trans dedifferentiation of HSC. However the co inventors have determined that BM contains a population of rare Sca 1 lin CD45 cells that express several markers of non hematopoietic stem cells and are able to differentiate in vitro cultures into mesoderm derived cardiomyocytes and ectoderm derived neural cells. These cells have been referred to as very small embryonic like VSEL stem cells. It is possible that VSEL stem cells circulate during organogenesis and rapid body growth expansion. Since VSEL stem cells respond to an SDF 1 gradient the SDF 1 CXCR4 axis alone or in combination with other chemoattractants might play a crucial role in accumulation of these cells in young BM.

Disclosed herein is that these highly purified BM derived Sca 1 lin CD45 cells 0.02 of BMMNC express both at the mRNA and protein level several embryonic stem cell markers such as surface marker SSEA 1 and transcription factors Oct 4 Nanog and Rex 1. In direct TEM studies it was observed that these cells are very small 3 4 m and show a very immature morphology e.g. they posses relatively large nuclei and contain immature open type euchromatin . The open type of chromatin in these cells correlates with the presence of mRNA not only for embryonic stem cells but also mRNA for several VSEL stem cells such as those that are competent to differentiate into skeletal muscle heart muscle neural liver intestinal epithelium skin epidermis melanocytes and endocrine pancreas. Thus disclosed herein for the first time is the identification at the morphological level a population of embryonic like cells in adult BM.

Additionally some of these cells express early developmental markers for neural cardiac or skeletal muscles at the protein level suggesting that despite their similar homogenous morphology these cells show some degree of tissue commitment and are heterogeneous. It is interesting to note that the expression of several potential chemoattractants of stem cells e.g. SDF 1 HGF SF and LIF are upregulated in damaged organs and hypoxia regulated induced transcription factor HIF 1 plays an important role in their expression Ceradini et al. 2004 10 Nat Med 858 864 Pennacchietti et al. 2003 3 Cancer Cell 347 361 . To support this notion promoters of SDF 1 HGF SF and LIF contain several functional HIF 1 binding sites. Thus the SDF 1 CXCR4 HGF SF c met and LIF LIF R axes might direct trafficking of stem cells.

To support this notion disclosed herein is the demonstration that highly purified Sca 1 lin CD45 cells express CXCR4 c met and LIF R at the protein level and respond robustly by chemotaxis to SDF 1 LIF and HGF SF gradients respectively. This observation is in agreement with the fact that murine embryonic stem cells also express functional CXCR4 c met and LIF R on their surfaces and SDF 1 HGF SF and LIF affect the motility of these cells Kucia et al. 2005c 3 Stem Cells 879 894 Guo et al. 2005 23 Stem Cells 1324 1332 .

One might also expect that if a population of Sca 1 lin CD45 BMMNC is enriched in embryonic like PSC these cells should be also able to differentiate along the hematopoietic lineage. However neither protected lethally irradiated mice nor contributed to long term hematopoiesis after transplantation into lethally irradiated recipients. Thus the population of CD45 cells appears to be restricted to heterogeneous non hematopoietic VSEL stem cell only. However it is also possible that in the standard assays disclosed herein the potential pluripotency of Sca 1 lin CD45 BMMNC was not detected and the final answer on their hematopoietic potential is obtained after injection into a developing blastocyst.

The number of embryonic like stem cells identified is higher in BM in young animals and their number decreases with age. Furthermore Sca 1 lin CD45 cells are barely detectable in 1 year old mice which corresponds to a 50 year old human. This age dependent content of VSEL stem cells in BM might explain why regeneration processes are more efficient in younger individuals. Differences were also noticed in the content of Sca 1 lin CD45 cells among BMMNC between long and short living mouse strains. The concentration of these cells is much higher in BM of long living e.g. C57BL 6 as compared to relatively short living DBA 2J mice.

Finally VSEL stem cells were highly mobile and responded to an SDF 1 gradient and adhered to BM derived fibroblasts. Time lapse studies revealed that these cells attach rapidly to migrate beneath and or undergo emperipolesis in these cells. Interaction of VSEL stem cells with BM derived fibroblasts was efficiently inhibited after their preincubation with CXCR4 antagonist T140. Since fibroblasts secrete SDF 1 and other chemottractants they might create a homing environment for these cells. Their robust interaction with BM derived fibroblasts has an important implication suggesting that isolated BM stromal cells might be contaminated by these small embryonic like PSC VSEL stem cells.

It appears that the Sca 1 lin CD45 cells disclosed herein represent a new subpopulation of BM derived stem cells. For example mesenchymal stem cells MSC have a morphology similar to that of fibroblastic cells. Hematopoietic cells are CD45 . MSC are also CXCR4 and CD34 and have never been identified at the single cell level. Similarly putative multipotent adult progenitor cells MAPC have not been definitively identified at the single cells level nor have USSC cells or MIAMI cells. The existences of these cells have only been postulated based on observed in vitro differentiation of cord blood or marrow cells to different tissues.

Furthermore the fact that Sca 1 lin CD45 PSC VSEL stem cells are very small should be considered especially in protocols based on gradient or velocity centrifugation employed to isolate stem cells from BM mPB and CB. It is very likely that the majority of PSC VSEL stem cells could be lost during those isolation procedures because of their very small size.

GFP Sca 1 lin CD45 55 10 35 mm glass bottom plate isolated from BMMNC of C57BL 6 Tg ACTB EGFP 10sb J mice available from The Jackson Laboratory Bar Harbor Me. United States of America were cultured along with C2C12 cells 1.5 10 35 mm glass bottom plate which is a subclone of the mouse myoblast cell line commercially available from the American Type Culture Collection ATCC Manassas Va. United States of America in Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Medium with 4 mM L glutamine 4.5 g l glucose 5 heat inactivated FBS 10 ng ml rhEGF 10 ng ml FGF 2. The growth factors were added to the cultures daily. The medium was exchanged every 72 hours. The embryoid body like spheres started appearing about 5 7 days after 5 starting the co cultures.

Cells from VSEL stem cell derived spheres VSEL DS were stained with propidium iodide and subjected to FACS analysis to assess ploidy of the cells. Three independent examples are shown in .

The embryonic bodies were fixed in 3.5 paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes permeabilized by 0.1 Triton X100 washed in PBS pre blocked with 2 BSA and subsequently stained with antibodies to SSEA 1 1 200 mouse monoclonal IgM Chemicon Intl.

Murine C2C12 cells are a primitive myoblastic cells line is employed as a model for myogeneic differentiation. In order to differentiate expand VSEL stem cells into myogenic lineage purified by FACS BM derived Sca 1 lin CD45 VSEL stem cells were plated over C2C12 cells. 5 10 of plated VSEL stem cells began proliferate and form slightly attached floating embryoid body like spheres containing round cells.

In order to rule out the possibility that these embryoid body like spheres were formed from the C2C12 cells VSEL stem cells were isolated from GFP mice and embryoid body like spheres were formed as in EXAMPLE 20. It was determined that the embryoid body like spheres were formed by the GFP VSEL stem cells.

The possibility of fusion between C2C12 cells and VSEL stem cells was excluded by DNA ploidy analysis. Briefly cells isolated from murine lymph nodes HSCs hematopoietic stem cells Sca 1 lin CD45 or VSEL stem cells Sca 1 lin CD45 were stained with propidium iodide and subjected to FACS analysis. DNA contents per cell were determined by staining cells with propidium iodide and subsequent FACS analysis see .

Interestingly the embryoid body like spheres expressed embryonic stem cell specific alkaline phosphatase see .

Further characterization of the embryoid body like spheres revealed that they expressed early embryonic developmental markers such as SSEA 1 GATA 6 GATA 4 FOXD1 and Nanog see . Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the cells that were present in the VSEL stem cell derived embryoid body like spheres were larger in size than the original VSEL stem cells from which they were derived upper panel but still possessed very primitive nuclei containing euchromatin.

Developmental migration of VSEL stem cells can be orchestrated by SDF 1 HGF SF and LIF. It was further determined that cells isolated from VSEL stem cell derived embryoid body like spheres responded to stimulation by these factors by robust phosphorylation of MAPKp42 44 which suggested that these factors might play a role in their development and migration. It was further determined that the corresponding receptors CXCR4 c met and LIF R respectively were expressed on the surface of the VSEL stem cell derived embryoid body like spheres middle panel .

Furthermore cells from VSEL stem cell derived embryoid body like spheres VSEL DS after replating over C2C12 cells can again grow new embryoid body like spheres up to at least 5 7 additional passages . However the number and size of these embryoid body like spheres became smaller with each passage. RT PCR analysis of cells isolated from the embryoid body like spheres from consecutive passages revealed an increase in expression of mRNA for genes regulating gastrulation of embryonic bodies such as GATA 6 Cdx2 Sox2 HNF3 AFP lower panel .

To generate neuronal derivatives neurons oligodendrocytes glial cells 10 50 embryoid body like spheres 35 mm glass bottom plate were plated in NeuroCult Basal Medium Stem Cell Technologies Vancouver British Columbia Canada supplemented with 10 ng ml rhEGF 20 ng ml FGF 2 and 20 ng ml NGF. Cells were cultured for 10 15 days. Growth factors were added every 24 hours and medium was replaced every 2 3 days.

At day 15 of differentiation the cells were fixed in 3.5 paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes permeabilized by 0.1 Triton X100 washed in PBS pre blocked with 2 BSA and subsequently stained with antibodies to III tubulin 1 100 rabbit polyclonal IgG Santa Cruz Biotechnology Santa Cruz Calif. United States of America nestin 1 200 mouse monoclonal IgGI Chemicon Intl. Temecula Calif. United States of America or O4 1 200 oligodendrocyte marker 4 mouse monoclonal IgM Chemicon Intl. . Appropriate secondary Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti mouse IgM were used 1 400 Molecular Probes Eugene Oreg. United States of America . In control experiments cells were stained with secondary antibodies only.

Before initiating differentiation embryoid body like spheres were given a brief wash in PBS. 10 50 embryoid body like spheres per 35 mm glass bottom plate were plated in DMEM F12 Medium with 4 mM L glutamine 4.5 g l glucose 1 heat inactivated FBS and 50 ng ml of recombinant human Activin A. After 48 hours medium was exchanged and differentiation was carried out in DMEM F12 Medium with 4 mM L glutamine 4.5 g l glucose and 5 heat inactivated FBS in the presence of N2 supplement A B27 supplement and 10 mM nicotinamide purchased from Stem Cell Technologies Inc. Vancouver British Columbia United States of America . Medium was changed every second day. Islet like clusters appeared after 12 17 days of culture.

After 17 days of differentiation cells were fixed in 3.5 paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes permeabilized by 0.1 Triton X100 washed in PBS pre blocked with 2 BSA and subsequently stained with antibodies to pancreatic C peptide 1 100 guinea pig IgG Linco Research Inc. St. Charles Mo. United States of America . Appropriate secondary Alexa Fluor 594 anti guinea pig IgG were used 1 400 Molecular Probes Eugene Oreg. United States of America . In control experiments cells were stained with secondary antibodies only.

10 50 embryoid body like spheres 35 mm glass bottom plate were plated in DMEM with 4 mM L glutamine 4.5 g l glucose 10 heat inactivated FBS and 10 ng ml bFGF 10 ng ml VEGF and 10 ng ml TGF L Growth factors were added every 24 hours and medium was replaced every 2 3 days. Cardiomyocytes differentiated after about 15 17 days of differentiation.

At day 17 of differentiation cells were fixed in 3.5 paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes permeabilized by 0.1 Triton X100 washed in PBS pre blocked with 2 BSA and subsequently stained with antibodies to Troponin I 1 200 mouse monoclonal IgG2b Chemicon Intl. Temecula Calif. United States of America and sarcomeric actinin 1 100 mouse monoclonal IgM Abeam Inc. Cambridge Mass. United States of America . Appropriate secondary Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 594 anti mouse IgM were used 1 400 Molecular Probes Eugene Oreg. United States of America . In control experiments cells were stained with secondary antibodies only.

To support the hypothesis that cells present in embryoid body like spheres growing from single VSEL stem cells are able to differentiate into all three germ layers cells from single VSEL DS were plated in differentiating media that support grow of cardiac myocytes neuronal cells and pancreatic cells. Both histochemical staining as well as RT PCR analysis revealed that cells from single VSEL stem cell derived spheres differentiate into cardiomyocytes mesoderm neural cells and oligodendrocytes ectoderm and pancreatic islets endoderm insulin producing cells. These changes in cell morphology and expression of lineage specific proteins were paralleled by upregulation of tissue specific genes see .

Two groups n 24 group of wild type mice C57BL 6 129 strain body wt. 25 35 g age 12 16 weeks purchased from Jackson Laboratory were used.

The experimental preparation has been described in Guo et al. 1998 275 Am J Physiol H1375 1387 and Guo et al. 1999 96 Proc Natl Acad Sci. USA 11507 11512. Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium 50 mg kg i.p. intubated and ventilated using a small rodent ventilator. Body temperature heart rate and arterial pH were carefully maintained within the physiological range throughout the experiments. Using a sterile technique the chest was opened through a midline sternotomy. An 8 0 nylon suture was passed with a tapered needle under the left anterior descending coronary artery 2 3 mm from the tip of the left auricle and a non traumatic balloon occluder was applied on the artery. Coronary occlusion was induced by inflating the balloon occluder. Mice in group I underwent a 30 minute coronary occlusion followed by reperfusion while mice in group II underwent a sham operation 1 hour open chest state . See Guo et al. 1998 275 Am J Physiol H1375 1387 and Guo et al. 1999 96 Proc Natl Acad ScL USA 11507 11512. Mice n 6 mice in each group at each time point were sacrificed at 6 hours 24 hours 48 hours or 96 hours after the onset of reperfusion.

Following euthanasia blood samples 1.0 1.5 ml from each mouse were collected in heparin rinsed syringes for the isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMNCs . Myocardial tissue samples were harvested from the ischemic and non ischemic regions and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen for mRNA extraction.

The ability of the bone marrow derived Sca 1 lin CD45 MNCs to differentiate into a cardiomyocyte phenotype in culture was tested. Due to the inability of the Sca 1 lin CD45 cells to survive when cultured alone Sca 1 lin CD45 and Sca 1 lin CD45 BMMNCs were cultured in separate plates along with unpurified bone marrow cells that provide a conducive milieu for cell survival. Twenty one days later these cells were immunostained to examine the expression of cardiac specific myosin heavy chain and cardiac troponin I. Cultured cells in plates to which the Sca 1 lin CD45 BMMNCs were added and D F exhibited a different phenotype compared with the plates to which the Sca 1 lin CD45 cells were added. Numerous cells in plates with Sca 1 lin CD45 cells were positive for cardiac specific myosin heavy chain C E and F green fluorescence . Many of these cardiac specific myosin heavy chain positive cells were also positive for cardiac troponin I arrowheads red fluorescence .

In contrast cultured cells in plates to which the Sca 1 lin CD45 cells were added were largely negative for the expression of these cardiac specific antigens . In the nuclei are identified by DAPI blue fluorescence . These results indicate that Sca 1 lin CD45 cells are capable of differentiating into a cardiomyocyte phenotype in culture.

The expression of cardiac specific markers GATA 4 and Nkx2.5 Csx in PSC VSEL stem cells was verified by immunocytochemistry. Murine control unpurified BMMNCs and BMMNCs chemoattracted to SDF 1 HGF and LIF or Sca 1 lin CD45 and Sca 1 lin CD45 BM derived cells sorted by FACS were fixed in 1 paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes permeabilized with 0.5 Triton X 100 and incubated overnight at 4 C. with rabbit polyclonal anti GATA 4 Santa Cruz and rabbit polyclonal anti Nkx2.5 Csx Santa Cruz Biotechnology Santa Cruz Calif. United States of America primary antibodies. FITC and TRITC labeled secondary antibodies were used for the detection of GATA 4 and Nkx2.5 Csx respectively. Cells positive for cardiac markers were counted using a confocal microscope Zeiss LSM 510 Carl Zeiss Thornwood N.Y. United States of America and expressed as a percentage of total MNCs.

The number of VSEL stem cells in young versus old mice was also investigated. The yield of Sca 1 lin CD45 cells that could be sorted by FACS was observed to decrease with age . It was further determined that VSEL DS could be formed in co cultures with C2C12 cells only by VSEL stem cells that were isolated from young mice . Interestingly VSEL stem cells from 2.5 year old animals formed cells clusters of round cells when co cultured with C2C12. These round cells expressed the CD45 antigen and were able to grow hematopoietic colonies in secondary cultures in methyllocelulose .

Staining and isolation of Cord Blood CB derived VSEL stem cells. Whole human umbilical CB was lysed in BD lysing buffer BD Biosciences San Jose Calif. United States of America for 15 minutes at room temperature and washed twice in PBS. A single cell suspension was stained for various lineage markers CD2 clone RPA 2.10 CD3 clone UCHT1 CD14 clone M5E2 CD66b clone G10F5 CD24 clone ML5 CD56 clone NCAM16.2 CD16 clone 3G8 CD19 clone HIB19 and CD235a clone GA R2 conjugated with FITC CD45 clone HI30 conjugated with PE and combination of CXCR4 clone 12G5 CD34 clone 581 or CD133 CD133 1 conjugated with APC for 30 minutes on ice. After washing cells were analyzed by FACS BD Biosciences San Jose Calif. United States of America . At least 10events were acquired and analyzed by using Cell Quest software.

CXCR4 lin CD45 CD34 lin CD45 or CD133 lin CD45 cells were sorted from a suspension of CB MNC by multiparameter live sterile cell sorting MOFLO Dako A S Fort Collins Colo. United States of America or BD FACSARIA Cell Sorting System BD Biosciences San Jose Calif. United States of America .

Transmission electron microscopy TEM analysis. For transmission electron microscopy the CXCR4 lin CD45 cells were fixed in 3 glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer pH 7.4 for 10 hours at 4 C. post fixed in osmium tetride and dehydrated. Fixed cells were subsequently embedded in LX112 resin Ladd Research Industries Inc. Burlington Vt. United States of America and sectioned at 800A stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and viewed on a Philips CM10 electron microscope Philips Eindhoven the Netherlands operating at 60 kV.

RT PCR. Total RNA was isolated using the RNEASY Mini Kit Qiagen Inc. Valencia Calif. United States of America . mRNA 10 ng was reverse transcribed with One Step RT PCR Qiagen Inc. Valencia Calif. United States of America according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The resulting cDNA fragments were amplified using HOTSTARTAQ DNA Polymerase Qiagen Inc. Valencia Calif. United States of America . Primer sequences for Oct4 were forward primer 5 TTG CCA AGC TCC TGA AGC A 3 SEQ ID NO 65 and reverse primer 5 CGT TTG GCT GAA TAC CTT CCC 3 SEQ ID NO 66 for Nanog were forward primer 5 CCC AAA GCT TGC CTT GCT TT 3 SEQ ID NO 67 and reverse primer 5 AGA CAG TCT CCG TGT GAG CCA T 3 SEQ ID NO 68 . The correct size of PCR products was confirmed by separation on agarose gel.

Real time RT PCR RQ PCR . For analysis of Oct4 Nanog Nkx2.5 Csx VE cadherin and GFAP mRNA levels total mRNA was isolated from cells with the RNEASY Mini Kit Qiagen Inc. Valencia Calif. United States of America . mRNA was reverse transcribed with TAQMAN Reverse Transcription Reagents Applied Biosystems Foster City Calif. United States of America . Detection of Oct4 Nanog Nkx2.5 Csx VE cadherin GFAP and 2 microglobulin mRNA levels was performed by real time RT PCR using an ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System Applied Biosystems Foster City Calif. United States of America . A 25 l reaction mixture contains 12.5 l SYBR Green PCR Master Mix 10 ng of cDNA template 5 GAT GTG GTC CGA GTG TGG TTC T 3 SEQ ID NO 69 forward and 5 TGT GCA TAG TCG CTG CTT GAT 3 SEQ ID NO 70 reverse primers for Oct4 5 GCA GAA GGC CTC AGC ACC TA 3 SEQ ID NO 71 forward and 5 AGG TTC CCA GTC GGG TTC A 3 SEQ ID NO 72 reverse primers for Nanog 5 CCC CTG GAT TTT GCA TTC AC 3 SEQ ID NO 73 forward and 5 CGT GCG CAA GAA CAA ACG 3 SEQ ID NO 74 reverse primers for Nkx2.5 Csx 5 CCG ACA GTT GTA GGC CCT GTT 3 SEQ ID NO 75 forward and 5 GGC ATC TTC GGG TTG ATC CT 3 SEQ ID NO 76 reverse primers for VE cadherin 5 GTG GGC AGG TGG GAG CTT GAT TCT 3 SEQ ID NO 77 forward and 5 CTG GGG CGG CCT GGT ATG ACA 3 SEQ ID NO 78 reverse primers for GFAP 5 AAT GCG GCA TCT TCA AAC CT 3 SEQ ID NO 79 forward and 5 TGA CTT TGT CAC AGC CCA AGA TA 3 SEQ ID NO 80 reverse primers for 2 microglobulin. Primers were designed with PRIMER EXPRESS software Applied Biosystems Foster City Calif. United States of America .

The threshold cycle Ct i.e. the cycle number at which the amount of amplified gene of interest reached a fixed threshold was determined subsequently. Relative quantitation of Oct4 and Nanog mRNA expression was calculated with the comparative Ct method. The relative quantization value of target normalized to an endogenous control 2 microglobulin gene and relative to a calibrator is expressed as 2 fold difference where Ct Ct of target genes Oct4 Nanog Nkx2.5 Csx VE cadherin GFAP Ct of endogenous control gene 2 microglobulin and Ct Ct of samples for target gene Ct of calibrator for the target gene.

To avoid the possibility of amplifying contaminating DNA all the primers for real time RT PCR were designed with an intron sequence inside the cDNA to be amplified reactions were performed with appropriate negative controls template free controls a uniform amplification of the products was rechecked by analyzing the melting curves of the amplified products dissociation graphs the melting temperature Tm was 57 60 C. the product Tm was at least 10 C. higher than primer Tm and gel electrophoresis was performed to confirm the correct size of the amplification product and the absence of unspecific bands.

Fluorescent staining of CB derived VSEL stem cells. The expression of each antigen was examined in cells from four independent experiments. CXCR4 lin CD45 cells were fixed in 3.5 paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes permeabilized by 0.1 Triton X100 washed in PBS pre blocked with 2 BSA and subsequently stained with antibodies to SSEA 4 clone MC 813 70 1 100 mouse monoclonal IgG Chemicon Intl. Temecula Calif. United States of America Oct 4 clone 9E3 1 100 mouse monoclonal IgG Chemicon Intl. Temecula Calif. United States of America and Nanog 1 200 goat polyclonal IgG Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Santa Cruz Calif. United States of America . Appropriate secondary Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 594 rabbit anti goat were used 1 400 Molecular Probes Eugene Oreg. United States of America .

In control experiments cells were stained with secondary antibodies only. The nuclei were labeled with DAPI Molecular Probes Eugene Oreg. United States of America . The fluorescence images were collected with the TE FM Epi Fluorescence system attached to a Nikon Inverted Microscope Eclipse TE300 and captured by a cool snap HQ digital B W CCD Roper Scientific Tucson Ariz. United States of America camera.

Statistical Analysis. Arithmetic means and standard deviations of FACS data were calculated on a Macintosh computer PowerBase 180 using Instat 1.14 GraphPad San Diego Calif. United States of America software. Data were analyzed using the Student t test for unpaired samples or ANOVA for multiple comparisons. Statistical significance was defined as p

VSEL stem cells were also isolated from human cord blood using the general FACS procedure outlined in EXAMPLE 2. For human cells antibodies directed against CXCR4 labeled with allophycocyanin APC CD45 labeled with phycoerythrin PE CD19 CD16 CD2 CD14 CD3 CD24 CD56 CD66b and CD235a were employed. Antibodies against the lineage markers were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate FITC . The isolated VSEL stem cells were CXCR4 lin CD45 under TEM looked like murine VSEL stem cells i.e. were about 3 4 m in diameter posses large nuclei surrounded by a narrow rim of cytoplasm and contain open type chromatin euchromatin and were enriched in markers of pluripotent stem cells by real time RT PCR see EXAMPLE 7 .

Multiparameter analysis outlined in was performed to determine if human CB mononuclear cells CB MNC contained a population of cells that resemble VSEL stem cells. In order to separate MNC from CB Ficoll Paque centrifugation was not employed and erythrocytes were removed by hypotonic lysis. Additionally it was hypothesized that CB VSEL stem cells like their counterparts in adult murine BM would be small and lin CD45 .

CB derived CXCR4 CD133 CD34 lin CD45 cells sorted by FACS as well as CXCR4 lin CD45 CD34 lin CD45 and CD133 lin CD45 cells are highly enriched for mRNA for transcriptions factors expressed by pluripotent embryonic cells such as Oct 4 and Nanog . Expression of these markers was subsequently confirmed by regular RT PCR . Furthermore these cells as is disclosed herein for BM derived VSEL stem cells are also enriched in mRNA for several developmental genes for different organs tissues such as Nkx2.5 Csx VE cadherin and GFAP which are markers for cardiac endothelial and neural tissue committed stem cells TCSC respectively.

CB derived CXCR4 lin CD45 cells express SSEA 4 Oct 4 and Nanog at the protein level. Murine BM derived VSEL stem cells express SSEA 1 Oct 4 and Nanog at the protein level. Thus immunofluorescence staining was performed to evaluate if CB VSEL stem cells also expressed similar embryonic stem cell markers. shows an example of staining showing that highly purified CB derived CXCR4 lin CD45 cells expressed SSEA 4 on their surface and Oct 4 and Nanog transcription factors in nuclei.

Transmission electron microscopy analysis of CB derived CXCR4 lin CD45 cells. CXCR4 CD34 CD133 lin CD45 cells were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy TEM . shows that CB VSEL stem cells were very small 3 5 m and contained relatively large nuclei and a narrow rim of cytoplasm with numerous mitochondria. DNA in the nuclei of these cells contained open type euchromatin that is characteristic for pluripotent embryonic stem cells. Thus the presently disclosed subject matter provides for the first time morphological evidence for the presence of a distinct population of very small embryonic like VSEL stem cells in adult CB.

It was observed that cells isolated from VSEL DS derived from GFP mice formed small secondary spheres if plated in methylcellulose cultures supplemented with IL 3 GM CSF . The single cell suspension prepared from these secondary spheres recovered by methylcellulose solubilization from the primary methylcellulose cultures if plated again in methylcellulose cultures middle panel or plasma clot right panel and stimulated by IL 3 and GM CSF formed hematopoietic colonies. Evidence that these were hematopoietic colonies was obtained by FACS analysis of CD45 expression of cells derived from solubilized colonies growing in methylcellulose or by immunofluorescence staining cells from colonies growing in plasma clot cultures for CD45 .

In parallel cells isolated from the colonies growing in methylcellulose were analyzed for expression of hematopoietic genes by employing real time RT PCR. Upregulation of mRNA for hematopoietic transcription factors such as c myb PU 1 and SCL was observed by normal RT PCR and by RQ PCR during expansion in the presence of IL 3 GM CSF. Thus VSEL stem cells might be a source of the most primitive HSC in BM.

VSEL DS are trypsinized and plated in methylcellulose based medium StemCell Technologies Inc. Vancouver British Columbia Canada . At day 5 of culture in methylcellulose medium cells proliferate and form small spheres. These spheres are recovered from methylcellulose cultures by aspiration are washed and trypsinized to obtain a single cell suspension and re plated in methylcellulose based medium that contains a selected combination of cytokines and growth factors for hematopoietic colony formation.

For CFU GM colony growth murine interleukin 3 mlL 3 murine granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor m GM CSF is added. At the same time an aliquot of these cells is plated in plasma clot cultures. The reason for this is that these cultures are suitable for analysis by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical staining. At day 4 6 hematopoietic colonies are formed both in methylcellulose and plasma clot conditions. Cells from the colonies growing in methylcellulose are recovered for mRNA isolation or FACS analysis.

Adult bone marrow BM contains Sca 1 Lin CD45 very small embryonic like stem cells VSELs that express markers of several lineages including cardiac markers and differentiate into cardiomyocytes in vitro. We examined whether BM derived VSELs promote myocardial repair after a reperfused myocardial infarction MI . Mice underwent a 30 min coronary occlusion followed by reperfusion and received intramyocardial injection of vehicle n 11 1 10Sca 1 Lin CD45 EGFP labeled hematopoietic stem cells n 13 cell control group or 1 10Sca 1 Lin CD45 EGFP labeled cells n 14 VSEL treated group at 48 h after MI. At 35 d after MI VSEL treated mice exhibited improved global and regional left ventricular LV systolic function echocardiography and attenuated myocyte hypertrophy in surviving tissue histology and echocardiography compared with vehicle treated controls. In contrast transplantation of Sca 1 Lin CD45 cells failed to confer any functional or structural benefits. Scattered EGFP myocytes and capillaries were present in the infarct region in VSEL treated mice but their numbers were very small. Transplantation of a relatively small number of CD45 VSELs is sufficient to improve LV function and alleviate myocyte hypertrophy after MI whereas a 10 fold greater number of CD45 hematopoietic stem cells is ineffective. These results support the potential therapeutic utility of VSEL transplantation for cardiac repair.

Numerous studies in animals have documented improvement in left ventricular LV function and anatomy following bone marrow BM cell BMC therapy after myocardial infarction MI 1 . The initial results of clinical trials also suggest improvement in LV function and reduction in scar size with BMC therapy in patients with acute MI as well as ischemic cardiomyopathy 2 . However several different BMC types numbers and routes of administration have been used in studies in animals and humans.

Adult BM contain a population of small CXCR4 cells that are nonhematopoietic and express markers of lineage commitment for several different tissues thereby exhibiting the potential to differentiate into various unrelated lineages 3 5 . These very small embryonic like stem cells VSELs are Sca 1 Lin CD45 they express among other lineage markers cardiac markers including Nkx2.5 Csx GATA 4 and MEF2C and acquire a cardiomyocytic phenotype in vitro under specific culture conditions 5 . VSELs may account at least in part for the beneficial effects observed with BMC therapy in MI. Thus selective administration of VSELs should be sufficient in itself to produce a functional and structural improvement in experimental MI despite the absence of all of the other cell types present in the BM.

Accordingly the goals of the present study were i to determine whether direct intramyocardial transplantation of VSELs results in improvement in LV function and postinfarct remodeling and ii to investigate the potential mechanisms underlying the effects of VSEL therapy. TQ separate cell specific from nonspecific actions Sca 1 Lin CD45 VSELs were directly compared with Sca 1 Lin CD45 cells which are highly enriched in hematopoietic stem cells and differ from VSELs only with respect to CD45 expression. The results show that administration of small numbers of VSELs after a reperfused MI is sufficient to improve LV function and dimensions and to attenuate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In contrast transplantation of much larger numbers of Sca 1 Lin CD45 cells had no beneficial effect. The ability of VSELs to alleviate postinfarction LV remodeling warrants further investigation of the therapeutic utility of these cells and may have significant implications for the design of future studies of BMC mediated cardiac repair both in animals and in humans.

The present study was performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Louisville School of Medicine and with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals Department of Health and Human Services Publication No. NIH 86 23 .

Experimental protocol. This study was performed in a well established murine model of MI 6 7 . The experimental protocol is summarized in . All mice groups I III underwent a 30 min coronary occlusion followed by 35 d of reperfusion. At 48 h after reperfusion mice received an intramyocardial injection of vehicle group I CD45 hematopoietic stem cells group II or VSELs group III . Echocardiographic studies were performed 4 d prior to coronary occlusion reperfusion 48 h after cell injection i.e. 96 h after MI and 35 d after MI prior to sacrifice .

Isolation of VSELs and Sca 1 Lin CD45 hematopoietic stem cells. VSELs and CD45 cells were isolated as previously described 5 . Briefly BMCs were obtained from the femur and tibia of 4 6 wk old male EGFP transgenic mice and red blood cells were lyzed with a 0.9 solution of NH4CI. Freshly isolated BMCs were resuspended in PBS containing 1 fetal bovine serum FBS HyClone Logan Utah . The following primary antibodies were added simultaneously biotin conjugated monoclonal rat anti mouse Ly 6A E Sca 1 clone E13 161.7 APC Cy7 conjugated monoclonal rat anti mouse CD45 clone 30 F11 and PE conjugated monoclonal rat anti mouse lineage markers anti CD45R B220 PE clone RA3 6B2 anti Gr 1 PE clone RB6 8C5 anti TCR PE clone H57 597 anti TCR PE clone GL3 anti CD11b PE clone M1 70 anti Ter119 PE clone TER 119 . Secondary staining was performed using PE Cy5 conjugated streptavidin. All reagents were purchased from BD Pharmingen San Jose Calif. . Staining was performed at 4 C. for 20 min and cells were washed with PBS supplemented with 1 FBS after staining. Flow cytometric cell sorting was performed using a MoFlo machine Dako Carpinteria Calif. according to the scheme presented in . Bulk sorted cells were collected into 2 ml DMEM with 10 FBS. The purity was assessed by reanalyzing isolated cells immediately following sorting. The viability of sorted cells always exceeded 90 . Sorted cells were pelleted via centrifugation at 1000 g for 10 min and resuspended in DMEM with 10 FBS in a smaller volume proportional to cell number. Cells were aliquoted in a 50 l volume for intramyocardial injection total dose 100 000 cells for group II and 10 000 cells for group III .

Myocardial infarction and cell transplantation. Three groups of wild type WT mice C57 BL6 strain body wt. 20 25 g age 10 12 wk Jackson Laboratories were used. The experimental preparation has been described in detail 6 7 . Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium 50 mg kg i.p. intubated and ventilated using a small rodent ventilator. Body temperature heart rate and arterial pH were carefully maintained within the physiological range throughout the experiments. Using a sterile technique the chest was opened through a midline sternotomy. An 8 0 nylon suture was passed with a tapered needle under the left anterior descending coronary artery 2 mm from the tip of the left auricle and a nontraumatic balloon occluder was applied on the artery. Coronary occlusion was induced by inflating the balloon occluder. Successful performance of coronary occlusion and reperfusion was verified by visual inspection i.e. by noting the development of a pale color in the distal myocardium upon inflation of the balloon and the return of a bright red color due to hyperemia after deflation and by observing S T segment elevation and widening of the QRS on the ECG during ischemia and their resolution after reperfusion 6 7 . The chest was then closed in layers and a small catheter was left in the thorax for 10 20 min to evacuate air and fluids. The mice were removed from the ventilator kept warm with heat lamps given fluids 1.0 1.5 ml of 5 dextrose in water intraperitoneally and allowed 100 oxygen via nasal cone. Forty eight hours later mice were reanesthetized and ventilated and the chest reopened via aseptic technique. Vehicle 50 l group I Sca 1 Lin CD45 hematopoietic stem cells 100 000 cells in 50 l group II or Sca 1 Lin CD45 VSELs 10 000 cells in 50 l group III were injected intramyocardially using a 30 gauge needle. A total of five injections were made in the periinfarct region in a circular pattern at the border between infarcted and noninfarcted myocardium. The chest was closed in layers and the mice allowed to recover as described above.

Echocardiographic studies. Echocardiograms were obtained using an HDI 5000 SonoCT echocardiography machine Philips Medical Systems equipped with a 15 7 MHz linear broadband and a 12 5 MHz phased array transducers 8 . The mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital 25 mg kg i.p. . The anterior chest was shaved and the mice were placed in the left lateral decubitus position. Using a rectal temperature probe body temperature was carefully maintained close to 37.0 C. with a heating pad throughout the study. Modified parasternal long axis and parasternal short axis views were used to obtain two dimensional 2 D M mode and spectral Doppler images 8 . Systolic and diastolic anatomic parameters were obtained from M mode tracings at the mid papillary level. LV volume was estimated by the Teichholz formula. LV mass was estimated by the area length method. Images were analyzed off line using the Prosolv data analysis software version 2.5 Problem Solving Concepts Inc. Indianapolis Ind. by an investigator who was blind to the treatment allocation.

Morphometric analyses. At the end of the study the thorax was opened the abdominal aorta was cannulated and the heart was arrested in diastole with KCl and CdCl excised and perfused retrogradely through the aorta with 10 neutral buffered formalin. The right atrium was cut to allow drainage. The perfusion pressure was adjusted to match the mean arterial pressure. The LV chamber was filled with fixative from a pressure reservoir set at a height equivalent to the in vivo measured LV end diastolic pressure 8 10 . The LV was sectioned serially into four rings perpendicular to its longitudinal axis processed and embedded in paraffin. The infarct area fraction was calculated by computerized planimetry Image Pro Plus Media Cybernetics Carlsbad Calif. of digital images of three Masson s trichrome stained serial LV sections taken at 0.5 1.0 mm intervals along the longitudinal axis 8 9 . The mid section was used to measure LV diameter. The thickness of the infarct wall septal wall and posterior wall was calculated in serial sections and averaged 18 91. An average sarcomere length of 2.1 pm was utilized in all cases to correct the raw measurements of LV anatomical parameters 10 .

For the assessment of cardiomyocyte cross sectional area digital images were acquired from trichrome stained myocardial sections. Cardiomyocyte cross sectional area was measured in transversely sectioned myocytes with a circular profile and a central nucleus 11 12 . On average a total of 100 myocytes were measured in each heart. All morphometric analyses were performed by investigators who were blind to the treatment allocation.

Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was performed in formalin fixed 4 m thick histological sections. Cardiomyocytes were recognized by the presence of sarcomeric actin Sigma and troponin T Santa Cruz endothelial cells by PECAM 1 Santa Cruz and von Willebrand factor Sigma and smooth muscle cells by smooth muscle actin Sigma 8 13 . Colocalization of cell specific markers with EGFP was used to identify cells that originated from BMCs 8 14 . Nuclei were identified with DAPI.

For the assessment of capillary density 11 12 sections were stained with an anti CD31 Santa Cruz primary antibody followed by the addition of a TRITC conjugated secondary antibody 13 . CD31 positive capillary profiles were counted at 100 magnification in contiguous fields in the infarct zone border zone and nonischemic zone. On average a total of 40 50 fields were counted in each heart.

Statistical analysis. Data are reported as mean SEM. Morphometric and histologic data were analyzed with a one way ANOVA whereas serial echocardiographic parameters were analyzed with a two way time and group ANOVA followed by Student s t tests with the Bonferroni correction as appropriate 15 . All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software version 8 SPSS Inc. Chicago Ill. .

Exclusions. A total of 233 mice 73 VVT and 160 EGFP transgenic were used. Sixty six WT mice were assigned to the myocardial infarction studies groups I III 160 EGFP transgenic mice were used as BM donors for cell isolation and 7 mice were used for the determination of myocyte area. Sixteen mice died in the early postinfarction period and 9 mice died within 72 h after intramyocardial injection. Three mice were excluded from the study due to failure of the coronary occluder leaving a total of 11 13 and 14 mice in groups I II and III respectively.

Myocardial infarct size. The average infarct area fraction did not differ significantly among the three groups . The infarct area fraction measures the average area of scarred tissue expressed as a percent of the LV area in three LV sections 0.5 1.0 mm apart 8 9 12 .

Transplantation of VSELs attenuates LV systolic dysfunction. Before coronary occlusion baseline all parameters of LV function measured by echocardiography were similar in groups I II and III . At 48 h after cell transplantation 96 h after. reperfusion the degree of LV systolic functional impairment was also similar among the groups indicating that both the injury sustained during ischemia reperfusion and that associated with intramyocardial injection were comparable. In vehicle treated group I and CD45 cell treated group II mice there was further functional deterioration between 96 h and 35 d after reperfusion . In contrast in VSEL treated mice group III neither global nor regional FIG. I J LV systolic function was impaired at 35 d as compared with 96 h. As a result at 35 d mice in group III exhibited significantly greater LV ejection fraction FIG. A F G and smaller LV end systolic diameter FIG. A F H compared with vehicle treated group I and CD45 cell treated group II mice. In group III there was also enhanced regional myocardial function in the infarct region as evidenced by a 48 P

Transplantation of VSELs halts LV remodeling. The extent of LV remodeling at 35 d after infarction was assessed both morphometrically and echocardiographically . Morphometry was performed on trichrome stained LV sections obtained at the mid papillary level . By morphometry the average LV chamber diameter was 12 and 20 smaller in group III as compared with groups I and II respectively P NS vs. group I P

Transplantation of VSELs attenuates LV hypertrophy. Since postinfarct LV remodeling is associated with myocyte hypertrophy and increased LV mass we investigated the effects of cell therapy on these parameters. To this end we compared the three infarcted groups groups I III with a separate control group of noninfarcted mice that were of similar age 10 12 wks and did not undergo surgery. Compared with noninfarcted control mice the cross sectional myocyte area was significantly increased both in vehicle treated and in CD45 cell treated mice 228 16 m 41 and 258 17 m 59 in groups I and II respectively vs. 162 20 min noninfarcted controls P

Impact of VSEL therapy on viable myocardium in the scar. Cardiomyocytes derived from transplanted cells were identified by concomilant positivity for sarcomeric actin and EGFP 8 14 . Scattered EGFP cardiomyocytes were identified in the infarct zone in group III whereas none was observed in group II the number of EGFP myocytes however was extremely small. To assess the effect of cell therapy on infarct repair the area occupied by myocytes in the infarct zone was measured and expressed as a percentage of the total infarct area. The infarct area was defined as the entire segment of LV that contained scar in myocardial sections stained with Masson s trichrome . Myocytes constituted 52.9 3.3 46.5 2.9 and 603 2.3 of the infarct zone in groups I II and III respectively therefore the amount of viable myocardium in the infarct zone was on average 15 and 30 greater in VSEL treated mice compared with vehicle treated and CD45 cell treated mice respectively P NS vs. vehicle P

Impact of cell therapy on capillary density myocyte apoptosis and myocyte cycling. Myocardial capillary density was quantitatively determined in the infarct border zone and in the nonischemic zone. In either zone there was no significant difference among the three groups . Similarly in either zone there was no significant difference among the three groups with respect to immunoreactivity for hairpin 1 probe for the detection of apoptosis and Ki67 a marker of cell cycling data not shown .

BMCs represent a heterogeneous population that includes various stem progenitor cells with diverse differentiation potential. Adult BM cells predestined to differentiate into various lineages VSELs might be responsible for the formation of tissue specific cells after BMC transplantation 3 5 . In the present study we examined the ability of VSELs to improve LV function and anatomy after a reperfused MI.

The major findings of the present study can be summarized as follows i myocardial transplantation of only 10 000 VSELs after a reperfused MI is sufficient to induce a demonstrable improvement in LV function and dimensions ii this salubrious effect was associated with attenuation of LV hypertrophy in the noninfarcted region and presence of regenerated myocytes derived from VSELs although the number of these myocytes was very small iii in contrast transplantation of a ten fold greater number of Sca 1 Lin CD45 hematopoietic stem cells did not improve LV function and dimensions. These results demonstrate that even a relatively small number of BM cells with robust differentiation potential can confer cardiac reparative benefits while a much greater number of CD45 hematopoietic stem cells fails to do so. The observations reported here underscore the importance of proper selection of BM cells and support the concept that small quantities of VSELs present in the transplanted BM preparations may account for the beneficial effects previously observed after BMC therapy 2 18 19 .

Small CXCR4 cells exist within the adult BM that express markers indicative of commitment to several different lineages including endothelial skeletal muscle neuronal and cardiac lineages 3 5 . In view of the ability of VSELs to differentiate into cells with cardiomyocytic and endothelial phenotypes in vitro the transplantation of VSELs after MI may improve cardiac function and LV remodeling. The present data supports our working hypothesis since it demonstrates that administration of a mere 10 000 VSELs results in amelioration of LV function and attenuation of LV dilation. The magnitude of these beneficial effects was modest possibly due to the small number of VSELs injected. The use of larger numbers of VSELs should extend these beneficial effects. There is approximately 1 VSEL for 10 000 BM mononuclear cells 5 . Thus to inject 10 000 VSELs into one heart we used the entire BM collected from 3 4 EGFP transgenic mice a total of 160 EGFP transgenic mice were used for this study . Previous investigators using BMCs 20 23 injected 10 100 fold greater numbers of cells 1 10to 1 10cells into the infarcted murine heart. It is conceivable that transplantation of similar numbers of VSELs could result in greater effects than those observed in this study with 10 000 VSELs.

Because several different cell types have been reported to be beneficial there is a perception that any cell therapy can alleviate post infarction LV remodeling. Therefore we felt it was important to compare the effects of VSELs which are Sca 1 Lin CD45 and nonhematopoietic not only with vehicle but also with another cell type. We chose Sca 1 Lin CD45 hematopoietic stem cells because the only difference between these two cell populations is CD45 expression thus Sca 1 Lin CD45 cells are perhaps the best control cells for studying the actions of VSELs. To ensure that a salubrious effect of the CD45 cells would not be missed and to strengthen the evidence supporting the beneficial actions of VSELs we decided to transplant CD45 cells at a 10 fold greater number than VSELs. The supply of CD45 cells is not limited by the constraints described above for VSELs. We reasoned that if CD45 cells have the potential to promote cardiac repair transplantation of only 10 000 such cells may not be sufficient to detect this property. Furthermore by comparing 100 000 CD45 cells with 10 000 VSELs we biased the experiment in favor of CD45 cells so that any evidence favoring the superiority of VSELs would be much stronger. Our finding that the transplantation of CD45 cells did not favorably affect any of the measures of LV function and remodeling provides assurance that the beneficial effects observed with 10 fold lower numbers of VSELs were the result of genuine reparative properties rather than a nonspecific effect of cell therapy.

The mechanism that underlies the improvement in postinfarction remodeling after transplantation of VSELs remains unclear. Isolated new cardiomyocytes and capillaries derived from the EGFP labeled VSELs were observed in the infarct region but their number was too small to account for the beneficial effects observed. VSELs may inhibit myocyte apoptosis and or activate endogenous cardiac stem cells 24 25 resulting in preservation of cardiac mass and or new myocyte formation. Although our measurements of hairpin 1 and Ki67 positivity did not differ among the three groups at 35 d after MI it remains possible that VSEL therapy was associated with reduction of apoptosis and or increased cell cycling at earlier time points. It is also possible that secretion of growth factors by VSELs might inhibit hypertrophy which would be expected to have favorable consequences on LV function. This is supported by the attenuated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy found in VSEL treated hearts . On the other hand the opposite is also possible i.e. that the inhibition of hypertrophy in VSEL treated mice might have been the consequence rather than the cause of an improvement in LV function induced by VSELs via other mechanisms. Further studies will be necessary to test these hypotheses. Whatever the mechanism for the effects of VSELs it seems reasonable to postulate that it would be potentiated by the transplantation of greater numbers of these cells.

The present results have implications for BMC mediated cardiac repair. Our data indicate that CD45 nonhematopoietic VSELs are more effective than CD45 hematopoietic stem cells and it seems plausible that an even more substantial improvement in LV function and structure after MI would be achieved with greater numbers of VSELs. Furthermore the present observations imply that VSELs are at least one of the specific subtype s of BMCs that account for the beneficial effects observed in several experimental and clinical studies of BMC transplantation 2 18 19 26 . This suggests that selective administration of isolated or expanded VSELs may be more effective than unfractionated BM transplantation. Since VSELs are normally present in the adult BM 5 harvest and transplantation of these cells may be accomplished in humans.

In conclusion we have provided proof of concept that BM derived VSELs can be used to alleviate LV remodeling after MI. Transplantation of a relatively small number of VSELs was sufficient to improve LV function and alleviate myocyte hypertrophy. In contrast transplantation of a 10 fold greater number of CD45 hematopoietic stem cells was ineffective underscoring the specificity of the actions of VSELs. Taken together the present results support the concept that VSEL transplantation could be used therapeutically for cardiac repair after MI.

The adult bone marrow BM harbors Sca 1 Lin CD45 pluripotent very small embryonic like stem cells VSELs which can differentiate in vitro into several lineages including cardiac and vascular lineages. Since mobilization of stem progenitors from the BM is a prerequisite for their participation in organ repair we investigated whether VSELs are mobilized into the peripheral blood PB after acute myocardial infarction MI . Wild type mice C57 BL6 strain 6 or 15 wk old underwent a 30 min coronary occlusion followed by reperfusion groups III V VIII X n 6 12 group or al h openchest state sham controls groups II and VII n 8 12 group mice were sacrificed 24 h 48 h or 7 days later and PB samples were harvested. Controls groups I and VI n 6 group were sacrificed without any intervention. By flow cytometry VSELs were barely detectable in PB under baseline conditions but their levels increased significantly at 48 h after MI both in younger 6 wk old and older 15 wk old mice 3.33 0.37 and 7.10 0.89 cells l of blood respectively . At 48 h after MI qRT PCR analysis revealed significantly increased levels of mRNA of markers of pluripotency Oct 4 Nanog Rex 1 Rif1 and Dppa1 in PB cells of 6 wk old but not 15 wk old infarcted mice compared with either controls or sham controls. Confocal microscopic analysis confirmed that mobilized VSELs expressed Oct 4 protein while Sca 1 Lin CD45 hematopoietic stem cells did not. This is the first demonstration that Oct 4 pluripotent stem cells VSELs are mobilized from the BM into the PB after acute MI. This phenomenon may have pathophysiological and therapeutic implications for repair of infarcted myocardium

Numerous studies indicate that the adult bone marrow BM harbors stem progenitor cells that replenish not only the hematopoietic system but also cells in other organs. BM derived cells BMCs have been shown to participate in tissue repair following injury to several organs including the brain liver lung kidney 27 31 as well as the heart 32 37 . Cardiomyocytes derived from BMCs have been noted in the heart after myocardial infarction MI 32 33 36 . The egress of primitive cells from the BM into the blood is an essential first step for effective tissue repair by BMCs 38 39 . Although BMCs have been shown to promote tissue repair the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Generation of multilineage cells from BMCs has been proposed as a mechanism for BMC mediated tissue repair and it is plausible that pluripotent BMCs capable of multilineage differentiation are mobilized from the BM after tissue injury followed by homing and tissue reconstitution. The adult BM harbors several types of primitive cells including hematopoietic stem cells HSCs 40 and a multitude of nonhematopoietic primitive cells such as mesenchymal stem cells MSCs 41 multipotent adult progenitor cells MAPCs 42 the marrow isolated adult multilineage inducible MIAMI cells 43 tissue committed stem cells TCSCs 44 and BM derived multipotent stem cells 45 . We have identified a rare population of nonhematopoietic primitive cells in the BM that are positive for Sca 1 and negative for both lineage markers Lin and the panleukocyte marker CD45 Sca 1 Lin CD45 46 .

Because these cells express a number of markers associated with a pluripotent state SSEA 1 Oct 4 Nanog and Rex 1 and differentiate in vitro into components of all three germ layers we have named these cells very small embryonic like stem cells VSELs 46 48 . Besides markers of neural endothelial muscle and pancreatic tissues VSELs are enriched in mRNA for cardiac specific antigens Nkx2.5 Csx GATA 4 MEF 2C and can acquire a cardiomyocytic phenotype in vitro 46 49 . We have also reported that murine BM derived VSELs are mobilized after various forms of tissue injury 38 50 . On the basis of the above observations we postulated that pluripotent VSELs might be mobilized into the peripheral blood PB after acute MI. Mobilization of pluripotent BMCs into the PB has not been previously documented.

Accordingly using a well established murine model of MI 51 we investigated i whether VSELs are mobilized from the BM into the PB after an acute MI and ii whether mobilization of VSELs is influenced by age. We used a comprehensive approach flow cytometry mRNA analysis by qRT PCR and immunocytochemistry to determine both the absolute cell numbers as well as the kinetics of mobilization. The mobilization of VSELs Sca 1 Lin CD45 was directly compared with that of Sca 1 Lin CD45 hematopoietic stem cells HSCs . Our results show that the levels of Sca 1 Lin CD45 VSELs increase in the PB soon after acute MI both in young and older mice concomitant with an increase in markers of pluripotency in the PB although the expression of these genes declines with age.

All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Laboratory Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee IACUC . The investigation conforms to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health NIH Publication No. 85 23 revised 1996 .

Experimental Protocol. Ten groups n 6 12 group of wild type mice C57BL 6 strain Jackson Laboratory Bar Harbor Me. were used. Groups I V were 6 wk old whereas groups VI X were 15 wk old. Mice in groups III V and VIII X underwent coronary occlusion reperfusion while groups II and VII sham controls underwent a sham procedure 1 hour open chest state without coronary occlusion. Infarcted mice were sacrificed at 24 h groups III and VIII 48 h groups IV and IX or 7 d groups V and X after MI while sham controls groups II and VI were sacrificed at 24 h after sham procedure for analysis of cell mobilization. Mice in groups I and VI were sacrificed without any intervention and served as controls.

Myocardial infarction. The experimental preparation has been described in detail 51 . Briefly mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital 50 mg kg i.p. intubated and ventilated using a small rodent ventilator. Body temperature heart rate and arterial pH were carefully maintained within the physiological range throughout the experiments.

Using a sterile technique the chest was opened through a midline sternotomy. An 8 0 nylon suture was passed with a tapered needle under the left anterior descending coronary artery 2 mm from the tip of the left auricle and a nontraumatic balloon occluder was applied on the artery. Myocardial infarction was induced by inflating the balloon occluder for 30 min Successful performance of coronary occlusion and reperfusion was verified by visual inspection i.e. by noting the development of a pale color in the distal myocardium upon inflation of the balloon and the return of a bright red color due to hyperemia after deflation and by observing S T segment elevation and widening of the QRS complex on the ECG during ischemia and their resolution after reperfusion 51 .

Following reperfusion the chest was closed in layers and mice were allowed to recover. To replenish perioperative fluid loss Dextran 40 10 v v in 0.9 sodium chloride was infused after surgery. Mice were euthanized at serial time points and blood samples were collected for flow cytometry mRNA analysis and immunocytochemistry.

Flow cytometric analysis and sorting of VSELs and HSCs from peripheral blood. The scheme for flow cytometric analysis and sorting is illustrated in . The full population of PB leukocytes PBLs was obtained after lysis of RBCs using I x BD Pharm Lyse Buffer BD Pharmingen San Jose Calif. . Cells were stained for CD45 lineage markers and Sca 1 for 30 min in medium containing 2 fetal bovine serum FBS . The following fluorochrome conjugated anti mouse antibodies were used rat anti CD45 APC Cy7 clone 30 F11 anti CD45R B220 PE clone RA3 6B2 anti Gr 1 PE clone RB6 8C5 anti TCR PE clone H57 597 anti TCR PE clone GL3 anti CD11b PE clone M1 70 anti Ter119 PE clone TER 119 and anti Ly 6A E Sca 1 biotin clone E13 161.7 followed by staining with PE Cy5 conjugated streptavidin all from BD Pharmingen . Cells were washed and re suspended in RPMI 1640 medium with 10 FBS. The percentage of VSELs and HSCs among PBLs was analyzed by flow cytometry using MoFlo Dako Carpinteria Calif. . The total leukocyte count per unit volume of PB was determined using the Hemavet 950 WBC hematology system Drew Scientific Oxford Conn. . The absolute number of VSELs and HSCs in 1 l of blood was computed from the respective percentage contents and the total leukocyte count. For immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy Sca 1 Lin CD45 VSELs and Sca 1 Lin CD45 HSCs were isolated accordingly to a previously described sorting strategy 47 .

Immunocytochemisty and confocal microscopy. Freshly isolated PB derived Sca 1 Lin CD45 VSELs and Sca 1 Lin CD45 HSCs were plated for 24 h on 22 mm diameter plates coated with poly L lysine Sigma . Cells were fixed with 4 paraformaldehyde solution for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.1 Triton X 100 for 5 min at room temperature RT . Blocking with 10 donkey serum Jackson Immunoresearch West Grove Pa. was performed for 30 min at RT to avoid nonspecific binding of antibodies. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies against Oct 4 mouse monoclonal IgG Chemicon 1 200 and CD45 FITC conjugated rat monoclonal IgGI clone 30 F11 BD Pharmingen 1 100 for 2 h at 37 C. Following washing cells were incubated with TRITC conjugated donkey anti mouse IgG secondary antibody Jackson Immunoresearch 1 200 for 2 h at 37 C. Nuclei were stained with DAPI Invitrogen for 10 min at 37 C. Immunofluorescent photomicrographs were acquired using a LSM 510 confocal microscope Carl Zeiss Thornwood N.Y. .

Assessment of expression of pluripotent genes by quantitative real time RT PCR qRT PCR . Total mRNA was isolated from the PBL fraction with the RNeasy Mini Kit Qiagen Inc. Valencia Calif. and reverse transcribed with TaqMan Reverse Transcription Reagents Applied Biosystems Foster City Calif. . Quantitative assessment of mRNA expression of markers characterizing pluripotent stem cells Oct 4 Nanog Rex 1 Rif1 and Dppa1 hematopoietic cells Scl and 2 microglobulin was performed by qRT PCR using an ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System Applied Biosystems Foster City Calif. . The primer sequences designed with the Primer Express software have been previously described 46 . A 25 l reaction mixture containing 12.5 l of SYBR Green PCR Master Mix and 10 ng of forward and reverse primers was used. The threshold cycle Ct i.e. the cycle number at which the amount of amplified gene of interest reached a fixed threshold was subsequently determined Relative quantitation of mRNA expression was performed with the comparative Ct method. The relative quantitative value of target normalized to an endogenous control 2 microglobulin gene and relative to a calibrator was expressed as 2 Ct fold difference where Ct Ct of target genes Oct 4 Nanog Rex 1 Rif1 Dppa1 Scl Ct of endogenous control gene 2 microglobulin and Ct Ct of samples for target gene Ct of calibrator for the target gene . To avoid the possibility of amplifying contaminating DNA i all of the primers for real time RT PCR were designed to contain an intron sequence for specific cDNA amplification ii reactions were performed with appropriate negative controls template free controls iii a uniform amplification of the products was rechecked by analyzing the melting curves of the amplified products dissociation graphs and iv the melting temperature Tm was 57 60 C. and the probe Tm was at least 10 C. higher than primer Tm. Three independent experiments were performed for each set of genes.

Statistical analysis. Data are mean SEM. The concentration of cells and the quantitative mRNA data fold changes in mRNA levels for cardiac specific transcriptions factors and those associated with a pluripotent state were analyzed with a one way ANOVA. If the ANOVA showed an overall difference post hoc contrasts were performed with Student s t tests for unpaired data and the resulting probability values were adjusted according to the Bonferroni correction.

VSELs are mobilized into the peripheral blood after MI. The numbers of circulating VSELs Sca 1 Lin CD45 and HSCs Sca 1 Lin CD45 were examined at 24 h 48 h and 7 days after MI. At each time point the percent content of VSELs and HSCs in PB was estimated and the absolute numbers of both cell populations per microliter of blood were computed from the respective total leukocyte counts. Combining the percentage of circulating primitive cells with the number of PB cells avoided possible confounding effects of dilution.

In control mice the number of circulating VSELs was very low 0.98 0.20 and 1.44 0.37 VSELs l of blood in 6 and 15 wk old mice respectively . The number of circulating VSELs in sham operated animals at 24 h after the open chest procedure was similar to that in respective untreated controls. 1.20 0.15 and 1.65 0.20 VSELs l of blood in 6 and 15 wk old mice respectively indicating that opening the chest in itself is not sufficient to mobilize VSELs. Circulating VSELs increased significantly at 24 h after MI in 6 wk old mice 2.28 0.30 VSELs l of blood group III P

Compared with the number of VSELs the number of circulating Sca 1 Lin CD45 HSCs in PB of control mice was greater 5.47 0.81 group I and 6.48 0.77 group VI HSCs l of blood in 6 and 15 wk old mice respectively . The number of HSCs did not change significantly at 24 h after sham surgery in either age group 7.69 0.66 group I and 5.46 0.74 group VI HSCs l of blood in 6 and 15 wk old mice respectively . However circulating HSCs increased at 24 h after MI 9.20 0.82 group III and 8.82 0.53 group VIII in 6 and 15 wk old mice respectively . HSC mobilization was even greater at 48 h after MI 15.19 1.31 group IV and 12.96 1.12 group IX HSCs l of blood in 6 and 15 wk old mice respectively P

The peripheral blood is enriched in pluripotent primitive cells after acute MI. To confirm the enrichment of PB with VSELs after MI we evaluated the expression of markers of pluripotency in PB derived cells harvested at different time points after coronary occlusion reperfusion. For this purpose we employed qRT PCR to detect mRNA for markers of pluripotency including Oct 4 Nanog Rex 1 Rif1 and Dppa1. In 6 wk old mice sacrificed at 48 h after acute MI we found that the PB was indeed enriched in cells containing mRNA for these markers 10.01 1.98 6.02 1.66 5.28 1.68 2.07 0.99 and 3.18 0.49 fold increase respectively in mRNA levels of Oct 4 Nanog Rex 1 Rif1 and Dppa1 compared with untreated controls P

Mobilized VSELs isolated from the peripheral blood express OCT 4. The expression of Oct 4 a marker of pluripotency at the protein level in mobilized VSELs was examined by immunocytochemistry. For this purpose both VSELs and control HSCs were isolated from the full population of PB cells by FACS. Sorted cells were stained for CD45 and Oct 4 markers for hematopoietic cells and pluripotency respectively. Confocal microscopic analysis following immunostaining confirmed that the mobilized and sorted Sca 1 Lin CD45 VSELs were very small 

The adult BM may harbor various primitive cells that possess the ability to repair nonhematopoietic organs. In this regard exogenous cytokine induced mobilization of BMCs has been shown to be beneficial after stroke as well as MI 32 52 . Moreover the identification of BMC derived cells in various injured tissues including brain liver kidney lung and heart indicates that tissue injury can induce mobilization of BMCs from the marrow into the PB 27 32 33 34 . However the mobilization of pluripotent stem cells after acute MI has never been reported.

Using complementary methods flow cytometry qRT PCR and confocal microscopy we report that pluripotent VSELs expressing Oct 4 are mobilized early after acute MI. We did not observe any significant difference in the levels of VSELs in the PB of untreated healthy animals vs. those subjected to an open chest sham procedure indicating that surgery in itself does not mobilize pluripotent cells from the BM stem cell pool. In mice subjected to MI the levels of circulating VSELs were elevated at 24 and 48 h followed by a return to the levels observed in untreated control mice at 7 days. The observations made by flow cytometry were confirmed by qRT PCR analysis. Previous studies have shown that various types of BMCs are mobilized after MI. These include hematopoietic stem cells 53 54 mesenchymal stem cells 55 endothelial progenitor cells 53 56 and other distinct subpopulations characterized by surface markers. Circulating CD34 progenitors 54 57 and CD34 CXCR4 CD34 c kit cmet subpopulations 58 59 have been observed in patients after an acute MI. Studies in animals have shown the presence of BM derived c kit CD31 cells in the infarcted myocardium after MI 60 . The progenitor cells detected in PB of patients with acute MI express increased levels of mRNA of early cardiac GATA 4 Nkx2.51Csx and MEF2C and endothelial VE cadherin and von Willebrand factor markers 58 . Similar results have been obtained in mice 44 . However the content of pluripotent cells as reflected by expression of markers of pluripotency in these mobilized subpopulations was not investigated in the above studies 44 58 . In this study we documented the presence of pluripotent VSELs in blood after MI via a comprehensive approach. First using flow cytometry VSELs were identified in the PB by their typical phenotype Sca 1 Lin CD45 . Second greater mRNA levels of markers of pluripotency Oct 4 Nanog Rex 1 Rif I and Dppa1 were detected by qRT PCR. Finally we verified by confocal microscopy the expression of Oct 4 a marker of pluripotency at the protein level in VSELs but not in the control population Sca 1 Lin CD45 HSCs .

In addition to examining the time course of VSEL mobilization after MI we sought to determine whether the release of these cells differs between young 6 wk old and older 15 wk old mice. Using flow cytometric analysis of surface markers we found that the kinetics of mobilization of VSELs was similar in 6 and 15 wk old mice. However at 48 h after MI when mobilization peaked the levels of mRNA for markers of pluripotency such as Oct 4 Nanog Rex 1 Rif1 and Dppa1 were lower in 15 wk old mice compared with 6 wk old mice. These data indicate that although cells with phenotypic attributes of VSELs Sca 1 Lin CD45 were released into the PB of older animals these cells lost markers of pluripotency with age an observation that is consistent with previous reports regarding attrition of pluripotency and functionality of stem cells with aging 61 63 . The observation that VSELs are mobilized after MI has important implications for the repair of cardiac and other tissues. We have previously shown that VSELs express markers of pluripotency such as Oct 4 Nanog and Rex 1 at the mRNA and protein levels 46 48 . We have also documented that under appropriate culture conditions VSELs give rise to cellular spheres akin to embryoid bodies expand efficiently resembling cultured embryonic stem cells and differentiate into the components of all three germ layers in vitro 46 48 . Mobilization of these primitive cells from the BM to the PB after MI would be the first step in their involvement in cardiac repair. Therefore the present findings of markedly increased trafficking of VSELs in the PB early after MI raises the possibility that these pluripotent cells may contribute to myocardial repair in this setting. Enhancing the mobilization of endogenous VSELs via cytokine or growth factor administration may be utilized therapeutically to promote repair after MI.

In conclusion our results demonstrate that pluripotent Sca 1 lin CD45 VSELs are mobilized from BM after acute MI. The circulating levels of pluripotent VSELs peak early 48 h after MI followed by a decrease at 7 days. Consistent with these observations the PB of infarcted animals is enriched in cells expressing markers of pluripotency Oct 4 Nanog Rex1 Rif I and Dppa1 although the expression of these genes in VSELs declines with age.

Bone marrow BM derived cells have been shown to improve left ventricular LV function and attenuate adverse LV remodeling after myocardial infarction MI . The cell type s responsible for these beneficial effects are identified in adult BM as a rare population of pluripotent SSEA 1 Oct 4 Sca 1 Lin CD45 very small embryonic like stem cells VSELs that differentiate into cardiac lineage in vitro. Using a murine model of MI we found that VSELs were barely detectable in peripheral blood PB at baseline but increased significantly after MI peaking at 48 h flow cytometry concomitant with increased levels of mRNA for markers of pluripotency Oct 4 Nanog Rex 1 Dppa1 and Rif1 in PB cells RQ PCR analysis indicating that VSELs are mobilized into the blood shortly after MI. Importantly direct intramyocardial injection of VSELs in mice improved LV function and attenuated LV remodeling suggesting that these pluripotent cells could be used therapeutically for repair of MI. Another promising approach to cell therapy is the use of c kit cardiac stem cells CSCs present in adult myocardium. We found that intracoronary administration of CSCs exerts beneficial effects both in a model of acute MI in rats and in two models of old healed MI rats and pigs in all cases CSC administration resulted in improved systolic function reduced LV dilatation and regeneration of myocytes and coronary vessels. These data support the therapeutic utility of CSCs for repair of both acute and old MI and provide the basis for upcoming clinical trials of CSCs.
